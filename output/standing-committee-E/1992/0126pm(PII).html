	<section>
	<div class='title'>ASSESSMENT OF SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 713, in page 86, line 37, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'including arrangements for translation and interpreting if these are deemed necessary.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with assessment procedures. It is not necessary to labour the important point on which it touches. I hope that the Committee accepts that language difficulty is a handicap not only for children, but for their parents. The irony is that linguistic handicap is denned outwith the special needs provisions of the Bill. I am not entirely happy with that. The Bill recognises that a young person needs extra help in some circumstances, but it does not deem it necessary that a linguistic handicap be given special help too, unless we regard defining special needs as about stigmatising young people—an idea with which I cannot agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment centres on children who come from a home where English is not the first language. Inevitably, some such children will require special education. To understand fully the procedure and the purpose behind the assessment, parents will need assistance with language. The amendment would ensure that, if deemed necessary, arrangements for translation and interpretation of the procedure were made available to children's parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is not complicated. I represent an area in which many people's first language is not English. The amendment reflects a problem encountered by people throughout the country, and I appeal to the Committee to recognise that the amendment would obviate difficulties that could result in the sensible proposals in the Bill not being put into effect. I hope that the Minister will respond sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee knows that I am always sympathetic; whether I can be obliging is another matter. It is self-evident that the substance of the amendment is desirable. The question is how best to achieve it. It is better not to include such a form of words in the Bill. My Department endeavours to publish such information—for example, in its charter booklet—in a number of different languages. We try to set an example. We have encouraged LEAs to provide such services and have encouraged parents to bring along someone to interpret for them when appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded that the wording of the amendment should be included in the Bill. This could, however, be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
another matter for the code of practice. We want to be positive about ideas that might inform the code of practice. If such a provision were included in the code, it would be more flexible than if it were set in firm tones in the Bill. I am at one with the hon. Gentleman; I simply hesitate to amend the Bill in that way. I hope that given my tone and the intentions that I have expressed, the hon. Gentleman will feel sufficiently comforted not to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be amazed at how comforted I am by him. He has been more helpful than he, with his usual modesty—or unusual modesty—thinks. Codes of practice now have virtually the same status as legislation, with the advantage of being updatable. The Minister's proposal is therefore preferable to including a provision in the Bill. He has been not only sympathetic but obliging, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 430, in page 86, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() of the name of any voluntary organisation which they are of the opinion is likely to be able to give the parent advice or assistance in connection with any special educational needs that the child may have and in connection with the procedures for assessment and the making and maintaining of a statement under this Act'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 456, in page 86, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() of the name of a voluntary organisation within the Authority area which they are satisfied will be able to provide information on the parent's and child's rights and the LEA's duties under this section of the Act, and'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is wonderful to see you back in the Chair again, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All children have a right to a good education, but unfortunately to claim that right some children need extra help. The purpose of the amendment is to put a duty on the LEA to inform parents on appropriate voluntary organisations that could help them claim that right for their children, when their special educational needs were being assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Bill we have received many representations from voluntary organisations. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) referred earlier—not in her abortive speech at 7 o'clock—to the role of the Spastics Society. It had carried out research particularly in "A Hard Act to Follow", and found that many parents were unaware of their own rights, yet alone those of their children. That lack of knowledge acts as a barrier to rights being taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want an open, democratic society, it should be open and democratic and available to everyone. That is the philosophy behind the amendments. The voluntary organsiations, including the Spastics Society, Deaf Accord and the National Portage Association, spend a great deal of time trying to fill in those gaps, as well as providing help and support. The amendment would ensure that such practical support can be utilised by parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efforts of everyone concerned—the statutory authority, the voluntary organisations, the parents and the child—are more likely to be successful if statutory and voluntary organisations work co-operatively together with parents. That can be done only if parents are kept fully informed about available help and advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way to keep parents fully informed is by ensuring that the agencies such as the health authority and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>
the LEA—the statutory bodies that have contact with the family—have a duty to ensure that parents know of voluntary organisations and other agencies that might help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will extend the Education Act 1981 to include education authorities, which will ensure that what was available to health authorities will be available to education authorities. It is vital that there is a named person in an authority. That valuable role is not being used to its full potential, which is to the detriment of parents and, more importantly to the detriment of children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the code of practice, which we discussed in the debate on earlier amendments, is used to the full and incorporates all those aspects. The code focuses on the development of the liaison function between statutory and voluntary agencies. I hope that the Minister—who is nodding—is in sympathy with the principles of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been welcomed by voluntary organisations, such as the Spastics Society. I shall take this opportunity to say that I am sure that the Committee was pleased to participate today in the "Make a Statement" campaign, organised by the Spastics Society. It argued that children with special educational needs had a right to be heard themselves and through their parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take an example from the National Deaf Children's Society, which provides a service in this respect under the 1981 Act. It deals with more than 1,000 national cases every year and with many more local cases on a voluntary level. The National Portage Association is another voluntary organisation that also has a statutory section. It is dear to me because that association has a portage project in Lewisham. It performs that function for parents of children with special educational needs, advising and helping them in ensuring that they get the type of education that their children need. I understand that a similar organisation in Wales advises parents about what is available to them. Obviously, there are many more such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the voluntary bodies involved in that sector are willing to do what they can to ensure that parents and their children exercise their democratic right to proper, high-quality education. From what those local organisations have said, we know that there is a demonstrable need for parents to have independent advice and assistance while a child is being assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lewisham, we have an excellent special educational needs policy. The borough contains special schools, other children are integrated into mainstream education and there are home school liaison officers. I believe that such people could be used by parents in a semi-independent way to ensure that parents are given the advice and support that they need to make proper decisions about the future of their children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voluntary sector tells us that after parents have contacted Deaf Accord, the Spastics Society and similar bodies, they often say that if they had been in touch earlier, the disputes and antagonisms that frequently erupt as a result of their discussions with authorities would not have occurred. That is the outcome that we should all want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
If the amendment is accepted, there will be less need for the tribunal to sit. I believe that it is a place of last resort in the view of the Government and the Committee. No doubt, we shall discuss the tribunal later. I have reservations about it and about whether legal aid would be made available. However, that is a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that many skills are available in the voluntary sector which can be harnessed in support of parents and children, but it needs the statutory sector to allow parents to tap into those skills. If that is done, we shall have a more effective decision-making process. In turn, that process will be speedier and, to be cynical, more economic, which should please the Government, or more efficient, to use their term, if that is what they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would involve minimal cost, but we recognise that the odds are stacked against parents who want to participate in the assessment of their children's needs. In Lewisham, many parents find it difficult to understand the system. Some may not have English as their first language or suffer disabilities and they find it difficult to communicate with the statutory authority. For such families, independent advice and assistance is not merely essential but fundamental to their ability to contribute to and participate in the assessment of their children's needs. If accepted, the amendment would go some way towards fulfilling the Government's promises in the parents charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, because we want sound local frameworks to provide a coherent range of services to support the education of children who have special needs. We want parents and children to have a clear voice in deciding how best to meet those needs. I also hope that the Government support our aim of looking for ways of promoting the partnership between the professionals, statutory authorities, parents and their children in the full assessment procedures and the drafting of statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Independent voluntary agencies will have that expertise. They will contribute a great deal and go a long way towards achieving that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend's clear exposition by taking up the reference that she made to a project in south Wales. We are probably knocking on an open door, because the Government already fund a project in south Wales. I refer to the special needs advisory project—SNAP for short—which is based in West Glamorgan. The project started from the premise in the Warnock report that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The successful education of children with Special Needs is dependent upon the full involvement of their parents, and unless parents are seen as equal partners in the educational process, the purpose of the report will be frustrated".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East has already referred to the fact that many parents are frustrated. When we debate clause 149, we may have the chance to consider specific examples of frustration, sometimes felt for more than two years. The SNAP project in south Wales was established by two major charities in the Principality, Mencap in Wales and the Spastics Society in Wales, which took up the challenge in the Warnock report. They went to the Welsh Office, and found the Minister of State a willing listener, who was happy to co-operate in that venture. As a result, the project was officially launched in June 1990 at county hall in West Glamorgan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
Ten fully trained volunteers now operate in that county and seven new volunteers will be trained and will be ready to take referrals from July of this year. So far the project has dealt with more than 400 referrals and given advice to parents in each case. If the Government are not willing to accept the exact wording of the amendment, I hope that they will be prepared to accept the spirit of it. I hope that a legal commitment will be given that LEAs will refer parents to a named person or organisation that will provide them with help and support during the assessment process for the statement and in the statementing process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like me to make it clear that SNAP gets its funding under the all-Wales mental handicap strategy. The charities involved did not come to me, they went to my colleague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realised that it was funded by the mental handicap strategy, but I thought that the Minister had an interest. I appreciate that the decision was not his; nevertheless, I am sure that he supported it all the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am proud to say that I originated it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So there we are, Mr. Martin. It is the Minister of State's responsibility after all; we can heap praise upon him. I wonder if the Minister of State might take the opportunity to speak in support of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now deep into consensus territory, and waist-high in the code of practice. All members of the Committee will find it easy to agree that the essence of Opposition Members' arguments can be supported fully. As with the previous amendment and with some future amendments, the only question is whether it would be fruitful to include amendment No. 430 in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a little history and much activity behind the scenes, which I shall describe briefly to put the matter into context. In circular 22/89 we encouraged LEAs to refer parents to voluntary bodies. The circular stated that outcomes had to be more satisfactory to all parties when such bodies are introduced at an early stage of the process. That is exactly the sense of the comments of the hon. Member for Lewisham, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are building on that and we have commissioned a major research project from the Council for Disabled Children to examine different models of partnership between LEAs and parents of children with special educational needs. That project is due to report this year and will add to our experience and view of how the process works and can best be encouraged. We have also asked our consultant who is working on the procedures for conducting assessments and making statements—that is what I meant when I referred earlier to working up the form, shape and details in the code of practice—to cover in detail the issue of parental involvement and the role that voluntary bodies and befriending services can play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the context of the Bill, of what has gone before and, more specifically, of the code of practice, the Department's process of trying to determine how best to encourage the process described by Opposition Members is well underway. That is why I do not want to include the amendment in the Bill. I should prefer to wait for the fruits of the research to fill in the shape and the details of the code of practice, in the expectation that that would be the best vehicle to promote the vital role of the relevant voluntary bodies. That would determine at exactly which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
stage they can be interposed, how best they can be involved and the best way in which parents can be put in touch with them. I do not want to prejudge, but that may also include information on which are the relevant bodies, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that that is the best way to proceed. If we build on what we have and use the developments which, fortuitously, are coming together at about the right time, the code of practice will be the most effective and practical way of encouraging the process that we all agree should be encouraged, rather than just using the form of words in the amendment. On the basis of what I have said, I hope that the amendment will not be pressed and that Opposition Members will look, as I do, to the development of the code of practice to provide an even better result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's comments and of the fact that he is clearly happy with the principle of the amendment and is just awaiting the results of the research, I should be happy for my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have received the signal about how to proceed on the amendment. It is embarrassing that the Minister has agreed with two of the three amendments that I moved. I am beginning to get extremely worried about that for two reasons: politically, I am not keen on the Minister agreeing with me; and I could end up having far more work to do if my hon. Friends think that that is a good idea. Therefore, I ask the Minister to hold back a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I agree that circular 22/89 encourages LEAs to work more closely with voluntary organisations, we tabled the amendment to put a duty on LEAs. I hope that the Minister will consider trying to tighten that duty. Officers in my LEA would welcome such a focused duty. It would also reassure parents. I hope that the Minister will consider that point when the research has been completed. In line with what my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 654, in page 87, line 7, after 'expired', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'or the parents have made representations before the expiry of the notice'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. Its purpose may be implicit in subsection (3)(a), but the amendment would make it clear that if a parent responds before expiry of the 29 days, the assessment process could begin immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he requires. The process can begin when all the necessary procedures have been undertaken. It should not be inhibited. The amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I need not detain the Committee, although the issue that I wish to consider is important. The amendment attempts to protect children in circumstances where professionals believe—perhaps subliminally—that they are under pressure to tailor a statement to available financial resources. The phenomenon that we are trying to overcome could be called "resource-led statementing". 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best guidance I can give is that the hon. Gentleman is most definitely here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the issue of resource-led statementing, the Select Committee recognised it as a problem in 1987 when it conducted its inquiry into special educational needs. Having received all the evidence, the Committee felt that it was the greatest single problem with regard to the assessment of children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that, because the amendment would provide that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"person providing advice under this section of the Act shall regard the welfare of the child as his paramount consideration"</p></blockquote>
professionals engaged in the process would be motivated by that consideration. Although their decisions might never be divorced entirely from the awareness of the resources available, the driving force of the legislation would be the requirement to regard the welfare of the child as paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has already been written and said about the need for separate responsibilities in the delivery of special educational provision. The report by the Audit Commission and HMI recommended a division between the LEA, as the body buying the services, and the schools as the bodies providing them. Although the divide cannot be juged quite so neat, because the LEA has other policy concerns which inevitably involve it in providing services also, it helped the Audit Commission to focus on the need for effective delivery of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government will accept that the prime consideration of any professional giving advice on assessment and subsequent statementing should be the welfare of the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is undoubtedly quite difficult territory, for one or two fairly obvious reasons. First, we are now, in a sense,—the hon. Member for Bridgend has touched on this—discussing the professional integrity of people who give advice in the context of the process that we are considering. The question is whether it is appropriate or even right for us to seek through legislation to bolster, correct or direct such professional activities. I should not want to push the parallel too far, but it is a little like saying that we should have some kind of requirement in health
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
legislation to strengthen the doctors' Hippocratic oath and to say that they must ensure that everything that they do is in the best interest of their patients. I should not have thought that necessary. I am not intimately acquainted with health legislation and someone who knows it better might well say that that is the case, but I should be astonished if it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty, which harks back to an amendment that was considered a short while ago—and I acknowledge the ingenuity of the hon. Member for Bridgend—is that we are now rerunning the argument about "effective" as against "efficient". We are trying again to find a means of determining whether more money can be made available through the Bill, in a slightly roundabout way. For the reasons that I gave in the debate about "efficient" and "effective", I do not think that that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because I find it difficult to believe that professionals are prepared to allow their integrity to be compromised in the way suggested and because, conversely, the addition of the words in the amendment would prevent the process to which the hon. Gentleman referred from happening, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. It is unnecessary and would not achieve the result that the hon. Gentleman suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister did not feel that the amendment was helpful. I understand some of his fears about resource allocation, but, again, we have taken a provision from the Children Act 1989 and prescribed it as a duty for those who assess a child. The prime consideration should be to have regard to the welfare of the child and there should be no problem with the definition.

	<br><blockquote><p>'() Before specifying a residential school on a statement an authority shall obtain the written consent of a child's parent.'.</p></blockquote>
To explain the need for this amendment, I shall refer to section 8 of the Education Act 1944, which states that local authorities must have regard
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the expediency of securing the provision of boarding accommodation, either in boarding schools or otherwise, for pupils for whom education as boarders is considered by their parents and by the authority to be desirable."</p></blockquote>
Some local education authorities interpret that as meaning that they may not name a residential school in a child's statement unless the parent consents. Other LEAs take the view that their discretion to determine special education provision includes powers to decide on a residential placement. There have been instances, of which the Minister may be aware, where parents were compelled to appeal locally, and to the Secretary of State, against an unwanted residential placement for a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would establish that it is not the business of LEAs to remove children from parents. The right to appeal to a tribunal against the type or name of school being set out in a statement is not an appropriate safeguard for parents, because it should not be the business of special educational needs tribunals to determine whether a child shall be removed from his parents and family home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Children Act was passed, children have not been taken into care as a consequence of their parents' failure to secure for them the education that an LEA deems necessary. Any decision on the removal of a child from the family home must be made by the social service departments of local authorities. The amendment would bring education law explicitly in line with the 1989 act as regards removal of children from parents. We hope that the amendment will find favour with the Minister, in either principle or its drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be well aware that parents have a new right to maintain a preference for a maintained school, whether or not it is residential. Authorities must comply with that preference, subject to the child receiving the special education that he or she needs and to that education being compatible with the education of the other children with whom he or she is taught and with the efficient use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents also have strengthened rights to make representations to LEAs about the school named in a child's statement before it is finalised, and the LEA must consider them. Representations could include the need for a residential placement. Moreover, if a parent does not agree that the school placement in the statement is appropriate for the child—whatever the preference stated or the representations made—he or she can appeal to the independent tribunal, whose decisions will be binding on the LEA. That point was made by the hon. Member for Bridgend. We should not diminish in any way the role and importance of the new tribunal. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for Further and Higher Education will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
take the Committee carefully through that matter on Thursday. It is right, of course, that parents' views are taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents who oppose a residential placement may have good reasons for doing so. However, I part company from the hon. Gentleman in an important detail. I believe that we must still retain the safeguards to protect children whose home may be a prime cause of emotional, behavioural or even learning difficulties. It is possible that, in limited circumstances, giving a parent in effect the right to veto placement of the child in a residential home would damage the child's interests. I feel that the balance and the safeguards in the Bill are about right. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the possibility that his amendment could inadvertently cause difficulties for some children. If he does that, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment. I understand his motives, but there may be a small number of cases—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say which LEA officers would remove the child from the home to take him to a residential school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, I am being given the answer in a note—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give the Minister time to read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not going to read it, I shall take a chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that, in such circumstances, the residential school would be named in the statement. In my view, the wording of amendment would give the parents a veto and require their written consent. To allow parental veto—in a limited number of cases and in defined circumstances—of a placement order in the statement may be the wrong thing for the child. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary nor desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered the question. When the parents object, which of the authority's officers will remove the child from the home and take him to the residential school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The note that I have been passed enigmatically states "none". That is the only answer that I can give the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, any decision to remove a child from the family home must be made by a local authority's social services department. If an LEA has statemented a child to be removed to a residential home, it appears that the final decision would rest with social services. No LEA member could do the job. Can the Minister tell us more about this mechanism and what would happen? My information is that no child has been removed from the family home over a dispute about education provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible for the child already to be in care when the statementing process takes place and, in cases which take place in the circumstances that we are discussing, the statement would name a residential school. I think that the amendment's procedure would allow the parents to stop the placement in the residential school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the parents would be able to prevent the child from being removed to the residential school until an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
appeal had taken place. There is another safeguard in the Bill's provisions, so the provision in the amendment is unnecessary. I stick to my advice that the Committee should reject the amendment for the reasons that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is still an element of uncertainty about this matter. The amendment relies upon parental consent being gained before a decision to name a residential school in a statement is made. Consent may be gained during a discussion about whether the parents accepted that residential school placement would be appropriate. The issue could be discussed before written consent was given and the authority ought to look for another way of handling the problem if it were not. It seems that the decision on taking a child from the home would lie with the social services department. I am prepared to beg to ask the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment so that we can clarify the procedure that we are discussing. A further amendment could be tabled or a clear description of the procedure could be given on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had experience of these matters. Social services departments will refuse to remove children from the home on the grounds of a statement, if there is no care order in place. It is important that we get an assurance from the Minister that, if he cannot answer the question now, he will write to my hon. Friend to say who is the local authority officer responsible for removing the child from the home, when a statement specifies a residential school but when no care order has been issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I shall write. I have done my best to answer the question; I defer to the experience of the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we discuss amendment No. 637, it may be helpful for the Committee to know that because of photocopying difficulties, some of the selection lists have missed out amendment No. 637 and amendment No. 433 and those grouped with it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 637, in page 88, line 12, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'after the relevant body has consulted the governing body of the school on the necessary provision for the child'.</p></blockquote>
On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome the Government's intention behind clause 149 (5)	<i>(b).</i> It is always a reasonable assumption that a grant-maintained
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
school should admit children with special educational needs, once the LEA has decided on a particular school after consultation. No case has ever come to court on this point; it is much better that legislation, rather than the courts, should clear up this grey area. I hope that the Minister agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that LEAs consult all schools before admission about the kind of provision that may be needed for a child. Nearly all LEAs consult schools before naming a school in a statement, but there may be new information that consultation would yield, which could affect the statement. When I was a head, I was very annoyed when the LEA decided to name my school and had not duly informed me. I am sure that such a situation would not occur, but the possibility still exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school might inform the LEA of its access problems, such as the need for ramps or for a toilet for the disabled. The NUT and the Spastics Society report, "Within Reach" showed that most LEAs have not conducted access orders of their schools. The amendment would require local education authorities to take into account the views of the school before deciding the provision in the final statement, instead of determining the provision before the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation need not affect the local education authority's final view on what should be in the statement. However, all the parties concerned—the school, the parents and the local education authority—will know that a consistent process of consultation had been followed. The aim of the amendment is to promote a partnership between the local education authority and the school. That is the opposite of erecting a block to admitting the child. It would promote the involvement of the school in the integration process by giving it ownership of that process, and it would encourage the ironing out of potential problems that might arise. I have explained briefly why it is important that the amendment is considered by the Minister. I hope that he will take into account what I have said and continue to be in the benevolent mood that we have seen this evening—and most of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those occasions when, having listened to the hon. Member for City of Durham, I should love to say that I shall accept the amendment, but I do not believe that it is necessary. In so far as it refers to local education authorities, paragraph 3(4) of schedule 9 already requires the local education authority to consult the governing body of a maintained or grant-maintained school, and the relevant LEA if the school is not in its area, before naming the school in the statement of special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were believed that the amendment is necessary to cover cases when the tribunal specifies the school to be named in the statement of needs, it should be noted that the tribunal will decide between schools proposed by the LEA and the parents concerned. The authority would have been obliged to consult its choice of school before naming it on the original disputed statement. The tribunal will rule only in favour of the parent if he can convince it that his choice of school is appropriate and that the LEA's choice of school is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parent may seek to support his case before the tribunal by providing documentary or other evidence from his preferred school. If the tribunal rules in favour of the parent, the LEA will consult the school before naming it in the statement. That is a roundabout way of saying that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
the circumstances envisaged by the hon. Member for City of Durham are covered adequately, so the amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The group of amendments is important. First, we want regulations to determine the grounds on which decisions are made about what needs shall be described as educational and what needs shall be described as non-educational. Secondly, under schedule 9 and clause 151, we want appeals to take place not only on the grounds of the special educational provision, but on the grounds of all provision that is made in the statement, whether special educational provision or non-educational, provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III and part V of the statement deal with special educational provision and non-educational provision. It is important that the Government tackle the issue and describe those two sectors correctly and with precision. Unfortunately it is often difficult to decide whether provision is educational or non-educational. Classic examples of that are speech therapy and physiotherapy. Until recently it has been important to make a distinction between the LEA having a statutory responsibility to make educational provision but not having the statutory responsibility to make non-educational provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is intended to send a signal to the Government that the distinction between educational and non-educational provision should be made less important. That would be achieved if the Government were to decide, for example, that the LEA had a statutory responsibility to ensure that both were provided. Alternatively, there could be a regulation to ensure that the LEA provides the educational provision and that a health authority or a health trust normally provides—although it could be a social services department in a local authority—non-educational provision. We want regulations to ensure that that can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many deaf children are without speech therapy because education authorities and health authorities and trusts have been unable to resolve disputes over funding and there is no one organisation that can mediate. I shall use an example that I referred to in Committee on 3 December 1992 at column 449. I visited the extremely good Nuffield language and speech unit at No. 6 Castlebar hill in Ealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set the record straight—perhaps I was speaking too quickly. 	<i>Hansard</i> referred to the Epsom Health Care NHS trust, but I meant the Mid-Surrey trust. I mentioned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
Epsom, but in that case I made a mistake. I meant to say the Surrey education authority. One mistake was caused by a slip between the words that came from my lips and the printed word, and the other was my direct error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the issue again because in December I thought that the problems over funding, for the following year at least, had been resolved. It appears from my recent contact with the unit that there is still a danger that the extremely good, indeed pioneering, work of the centre is in danger of being lost because the Department of Health and the Department for Education cannot agree on how the funding matter should be resolved—a lot of speech therapy is involved in the provision. The Departments are saying that it is up to the local education authorities who send children to the unit and the health authorities or trusts from which children come to the unit to sort out the funding problem. They feel that despite the Lancaster agreement there is still doubt.

The Lancaster agreement concerned a child who initially had his need for speech therapy provision set out in part V—that is the non-educational provision in the statement—despite the fact that the needs in part II clearly showed that provision of such therapy would be educationally appropriate. The parents fought to have speech therapy included in part III—educational provision—arguing that the educational provision needed to meet the stated needs of the child must be acknowledged. The authority had previously argued that, because a service was being provided by the health authority, the education authority had no obligation to recognise it as an educational provision which they had a duty to provide or arrange. The Association for All Speech Impaired Children and an organisation with the acronym VOCAL took up that case and something was done.

It is obvious from the Lancashire hearing that there must be an increase in resources for speech and language therapy within local education authorities. Funnily enough, or percipiently enough, the Scottish Office recognised the need to make extra resources for speech and language therapy within education in April 1992, and provided an extra £2 million in the 1992–93 local government settlements for LEAs in Scotland. The equivalent amount in England would be £20 million. It is important to get a clear definition of educational and non-educational needs and to make it clear which authority should fund that provision.

A case study from the Spastics Society report, "A Hard Act to Follow", concerning a girl given the pseudonym Shirley states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At first we were quite happy with the school, but as time went on the shortfalls became more apparent. At age five we took Shirley to Bobath in London. The importance of physiotherapy was brought home to us. Shirley had only one session per week at school, she was slowly deteriorating. Since Bobath (which she still has) she has made progress. Speech therapy at school seemed more concerned with sign language and symbols than speech. Again her speech started after commencing Bobath therapy. As she got older, she was getting further and further behind academically as she was not being taught, she was bored and hated going to school. The assessment took 3 years to complete and we still have not had a statement."</p></blockquote>
The dispute in that case is over whether the physiotherapy is educational and whether it should be provided by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>
LEA or the health authority or trust. The amendments, which would allow appeals on the ground of the provision in the statement, not just the educational provision, are badly needed to tackle a real and serious problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the importance of the issue, but wonder whether it can be reduced—as the hon. Gentleman suggested—to black and white or hard and fast ruling or to finely defined regulations, much though many people may crave that. I accept that in some cases there is still confusion about where on a child's statement services such as speech therapy—the example that is nearly always cited—should be shown. The argument is: as such services are rarely delivered by the LEA, why should they not be shown as non-educational? That is one way of looking at the matter. However, the source of provision is not necessarily the key point. A service usually provided by a health authority may be educational or non-educational. What matters is its purpose. If the purpose is educational, the provision should be specified in part III of the statement; if non-educational, in part V.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That gives rise to the question how a service is to be defined as educational or non-educational. The answer is more complicated than the hon. Gentleman suggested, although I understand why he and many others would like a relatively simple answer. We must consider guidance issued by my Department and by the Department of Health, and court judgments. Where the primary purpose of a service such as speech therapy is to meet the child's special educational needs, the delivery of the service should be specified in part III. Similarly, some children may need physiotherapy to help them learn. In that case, it should be specified as a special educational provision in part III.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the extent to which children's needs and circumstances vary, it will not be possible to lay down hard and fast rules in Acts of Parliament. I shall deal in a moment with whether that will be possible in regulations. Speech therapy will most often be special educational provision, but it could be non-educational. Physiotherapy may seem to be an unlikely special educational need but, for a child with cerebral palsy, it may be essential to enable him to learn. There are no straightforward answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1987, when speech therapy was the responsibility of the health authority, and a court case on the matter had taken place, we discussed the subject during our consideration of the Education Reform Bill. It was decided that local education authorities or health authorities could provide speech therapy. We are now in a worse position than in 1987. At least in 1987 we knew that it was the health authority's responsibility to provide speech therapy. Now, because local education authorities can provide speech therapy, it is in no man's land. Neither the local education authority nor the health authority is prepared to undertake to fund it. It is a grey area. We must decide that it is the responsibility of either the health authority or the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see why the hon. Gentleman is tempted by that simple solution, but I do not believe that the matter can be reduced to that degree of simplicity. I suggest to the Committee that where, in an individual child's circumstances, the need is defined as educational, it is correctly specified in part III; where non-educational, in part V. We must then identify where the responsibility lies. For part III provision, the provider of last resort is the local education authority. In some circumstances, the LEA may

look to the local health authority for the provision, but it is clear that the LEA is the provider of last resort for part III provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that that is chaos. I am not sure that we would make progress if we tried to provide a blanket definition with clearly defined edges for a matter such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister look at the matter from the parents' point of view? Their child needs speech therapy and to them it matters not a jot whether the need is defined in part III or part V, or in any Education Act. Does the Minister agree that the prime purpose of any legislation is to get that service to the child as quickly as possible, before further damage is done to the child's chances? Whether those chances are educational or non-educational, the child's development is a whole, not separate parts. We are arguing about a legislative framework. The message that we are giving to parents of special needs children is that we are more intent on arguing about the letter of the law under one clause or another than on satisfying the needs of their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that that may be how it is seen if we attempt to define boundaries neatly and concisely in a bewilderingly complex set of circumstances. There is a strong temptation to do that, but it does not always provide the right answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yardley touched on an important point, but I do not know how far we can draw it out in the debate on the amendment. She referred to the speed with which a statement is produced. We deal with that problem in another part of the Bill. It is an important aspect of the solution to the problem that has bedevilled the provision of statements and the identification of special educational needs for a long time. We are trying to tackle that problem for the first time, but it should not be confused with this issue. It is a timetabling problem than can and must be dealt with, but it is separate from the attempt in the amendment to provide a neat and clean solution to what are undoubtedly difficult and complex circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In whatever part of the statement speech therapy is defined—whether it is in part III, education, or part V, health and social services—it is always provided by the health authority, even though it may be purchased from that authority by the education authority. A survey carried out by the Association for All Speech Impaired Children showed that only 29 LEAs were buying speech therapy from the health authority. It is impossible to believe that that represents the total educational need of such children. It implies that there is a great deal of confusion and chaos. Surely, the Minister would like to clear that up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one always wants to clear up chaos if that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If chaos and/or confusion exist, we must try to clear it up. Whether we can do so straightforwardly by providing a neat and elegant solution is doubtful. By a combination of the timetabling provisions, the introduction of the tribunal—which will have a significant role to play—and the necessary regulations that we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>1130</span>
introduce to underpin the procedures, we shall move some way towards dealing with the difficulties and anomalies. I doubt that it is possible simply to introduce an all-embracing set of rules and regulations that will clearly identify in every conceivable circumstance what the provision will be, for whom and how it will be provided. We must consider the development of regulations to underpin the overall aims of the Bill, the speeding up of the timetable and the role of the tribunal. That is the way to deal with the problem, rather than the more simple, direct and, on the face of it, tempting way proposed in the amendment. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, not because its aims and its purpose are at fault, but because I do not believe that it is the correct way to achieve those aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that, although the Government have tabled amendments to improve the Bill, they have not accepted the amendment. I accept the Minister's point that speech therapy and physiotherapy are provided sometimes for a specific educational purpose and sometimes for a non-educational purpose. The aim of the amendment was to seek guidance from the Government on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I recall correctly, I was sympathising with the Minister over the possible difficulty of determining whether physiotherapy or speech therapy services are provided to meet a specific educational need or a health need. We hoped that the amendment would help the Minister, encouraging him to think in depth about the sort of problems to which he referred in his response. I thought that he would say—I hope that he will clarify the matter—that that was something else that would be dealt with in the code of practice which would guide local authorities in compiling a statement on what can be described as educational or non-educational provisions. It should be made clear in the code of practice that the statement must specify who has the responsibility to provide for the needs outlined in the statement. That would overcome the problem of whether it was an educational or non-educational provision. Whichever category it fell into, that problem could be overcome if the guidelines were clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was raised whether to delete from schedule 9 and clause 151 the words "special educational", so that appeals took place on the provision in the statement and not the specific educational provision in the statement. We sought clarification on whether the reference to special educational provision encompassed all provision in the statement, whether educational or non-educational, and on whether we would be right to take out the words "special educational" and allow a parent to have a ground of appeal on the provision in the statement, whether special educational or special non-educational. I hope that the Minister will either remind me of what he said or cover that point now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, I recall saying that we would have to cover those difficulties as we developed the combination of guidance, the code of practice and the drawing up of regulations, all of which underpin the different parts of the Bill. I cannot prejudge the form the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1131</span>
attempts at clarification will take. We hope to tackle the difficulties thrown up by the debate, but I shall not attempt now to predict how that will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that I have raised expectations about the code of practice to an almost hysterical level, so perhaps it is time to bring them down to a more realistic level. The code will be a key point in the proceedings and may have some bearing on them. I cannot prejudge the detailed work being done. I have given the Committee some idea of what is happening, but I do not want to pre-empt it. Suffice it to say that somewhere in the combination of more detailed guidance, the code of practice and regulations, these matters will be touched on. I hope that we can go a long way towards providing the clarity that Opposition Members seek. That is as far as I can reasonably go in response to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have not heard the Minister's views on excluding "special educational" from schedule 9 and clause 151, and allowing parents to appeal against all provision in a statement, and his views on whether both special educational provision and special non-educational provision—parts III and V of the statement—are covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the answer is that where a service such as speech therapy forms part of the special educational provision required by a child and is shown in part III, whether or not it is provided by another agency, it may form part of an appeal to the tribunal. The same applies if speech therapy or some other therapy is not specified in part III and the parent thinks that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the intention is to make providers of non-educational services party to an appeal, that is unnecessary. The local education authority is responsible for making the provision in part III, so the LEA itself must answer to the tribunal. I am assured that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It answers my question but does not satisfy me, simply because it has revealed that the non-educational provision in the statement has no direct bearing on the special educational provision—which might be needed for physical or health reasons—and that even if a parent is dissatisfied with that part of the statement, he has no right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not force the issue to a vote. I merely ask the Minister whether it is right that part of the provision in the statement cannot be subject to parental appeal. We shall look at the matter again to decide how serious is the Minister's response. We would like that response to be in black and white so that we can consider whether to pursue it on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explore the important matter of statementing and the frequent imprecision of statements. Clause 149 considers their form and content. It is as well to raise the matter now, when the Minister has warned us against the danger of expecting too much from the code of practice. The imprecision of statements is a considerable grievance among parents. It leads to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1132</span>
misinterpretation and even misuse of statements. Part III of a statement describes the provision that is to be made for a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statement deals with the nature of the help that is to be provided. Its phraseology can be imprecise. A typical instruction prescribes extra help and support in a small group of children who have similar problems. Other examples include the vague: "needs help with handwriting"; or "requires mainstream support"—a definition for different subjects is not provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statement also covers the amount of time that should be provided. The phrase "up to" is common—for example, "up to two hours" or "up to five hours". That is too unspecific. Some parents are pursuing litigation on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statements also deal with required staffing. Descriptions include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons who have had instruction in specific learning difficulties".</p></blockquote>
That could apply to someone who has taken a brief course. Someone with no specific knowledge of dyslexia could be required to teach dyslexic children. Dyslexia is a specific difficulty, about which there is increasing knowledge. A teacher of dyslexic children should be instructed well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compare the vague statements to which I have referred with the third draft of a statement that was provided to a parent. The first two statements were too vague. The third statement prescribes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Appropriate multi-sensory programmes/resources for use by individual support teacher to include:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>Somerset Thinking Skills by Nigel Blagg</li>
	<li>Alpha to Omega (Hornsby and Shear)</li>
	<li>Units of Sound by Walter Brambly</li>
	<li>A programme to develop numeracy skills e.g. Kent Maths Project.</li>
	<li>A programme designed to develop fine motor skills via the utilization of a graded handwriting programme."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
Those are specific instructions. They continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Five hours per week within class support teaching for academic subjects as deemed appropriate by school staff."</p></blockquote>
Imprecise statements can be dangerous. The assessment and statementing process is lengthy. After a wait of two years, statements arrive, and parents accept them, despite their inadequacy, because they fear a further delay if they reject the statements. They fear that no provision will be made for their child, whose condition could continue to decline. A LEA may sometimes provide a deliberately vague statement to cause the parent to reject it. That delays the time when the LEA must provide help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents sometimes mistake appendices for the description of the provision. The appendices include the report of the psychologists, which may make detailed recommendations, but they may not be specified in the statement and parents could misunderstand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the appendices are submitted in writing, the authors should discuss them with the parents so that the parents are appraised fully of what they contain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That collaborative approach between parents and officials should be pursued, although often it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind such difficulties, it is no wonder that the British Dyslexia Association found it necessary to establish a network of befrienders to help parents. There are as many as 200 in England and Wales, each trained and supported by the association.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1133</span>
Vague statements are unsatisfactory for many reasons. First, they are an inadequate guide to schools, which do not know how to interpret them and, therefore, how much to provide. They can lead to inadequate provision for pupils and mean that the school's budget is insufficient for the needs of the pupil or that the LEA provides insufficient resources to the school. They also give far too much discretion to the school, which can divert to other purposes funds that should be used properly for the child's provision. I do not like to speak in that way about professionals, but we live in a sinful world and people at all levels, even in professions, do not always behave with total propriety. It is essential that the code of conduct deals with that and ensures that statements have such precision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister prepared to say that the code of conduct will stipulate a need for a precise definition of the provisions that should be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will allow me some latitude, Mr. Martin, because I want to make some general points about statements. Some of them might have been dealt with more suitably under other clauses but the guillotine meant that we did not have time to discuss them. Therefore, I hope that you will be a little indulgent, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make some remarks about the statementing process at the pre-school stage. We all recognise the importance of identifying special educational needs as early as possible in a child's life so that they can be provided for and the difficulties corrected. It is unfortunate that there is insufficient provision in the state sector to accommodate the large numbers of children with special educational needs. I want to highlight the provision that might be made as part of a statement for the under-fives, because the provision does not have to be nursery provision. However, I have to say that there are good examples, particularly—or, perhaps I should say, "even"—in the private sector of the integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream nursery schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One case was brought to my attention by the Centre for Studies on Integration in Special Education. It reported that a nursery school, which had started as a private playgroup, had 50 children with special educational needs in a class of 170 children. One little girl, who had to be propped up on cushions so that she could participate in class, was successfully integrated into a mainstream school when she left the nursery. I am happy to tell the Committee that she now has three A-levels and a place at university. That shows how important and useful nursery provision is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, other provision is also important. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East mentioned the Portage model for helping children. That respected service has widespread support among parents and groups involved in special needs, such as Mencap, the Spastics Society and the Down's Syndrome Association. An effective service needs to be capable of easy delivery, to be efficient and to make best use of parents, who are the child's best teachers. It must be flexible and capable of delivery in short bursts, using checklists and activity charts. It must be user friendly. It must not make unreasonable demands on parents, and it must make the best use of all resources available to help the child. Finally, it must be relatively inexpensive. As far as can be ascertained, Portage is the only service in Britain that meets those criteria. Essentially, it is a home visiting
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
service and is designed to help the parents of a child with special needs to teach their child. It was started by psychologists in Portage, Wisconsin in 1972—hence the name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other provision that could be made at the pre-school stage is tripartite funding by health services, social services and education departments. In Cambridgeshire, a pre-school playgroup association worker was appointed to liaise between statutory agencies for children with special educational needs and playgroups, and to support playgroup staff. The provisions that I have described could be made at the pre-school stage. They need not be expensive and it is important that we include them as part of the total special educational needs provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the responsibility for statementing children with special educational needs. The report from the local government ombudsman of an investigation carried out against Cambridgeshire county council has been brought to my attention. The case is interesting and illustrates a matter that is worthy of being given some thought by the Minister and his Department. It involved a dyslexic child who attended a mainstream school, which did not recognise that the child had special educational needs. Despite his parent's concern, the school considered that he did not require a statement and that he did not need to see an educational psychologist. The school did not even consider the matter worthy of the LEA's attention. Unfortunately, the LEA carried the can in the end, as the parents decided to take their case to the local government ombudsman when finally the child was diagnosed as dyslexic by the Dyslexia Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net result was that the LEA had to pay out about £5,000 as compensation to the child and his parents. That is an example of what might happen in a grant-maintained school. I hope that the Minister will clarify who is responsible for defining special educational need in a case such as that, especially in a grant-maintained school. If the LEA has the responsibility, what will happen if it can prove that the grant-maintained school did not bring the child to its attention? Does the responsibility then lie with the governors? If it is their responsibility, are they personally liable for the money paid in compensation to the parents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want clarification of where responsibility ultimately lies for the provision of a statement if it is not diagnosed that a child needs one. The Minister looks puzzled, but the case was spelt out well by the local government ombudsman who said that the difficulty was that the LEA did not know about the case that I mentioned, but that it was still held to be responsible. Such a problem is much more likely to occur with a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I welcome the rules that the Government are introducing to tighten the statementing process and to make the provision much more specific. The other day, I quoted the case of a child in my constituency whose statement said that he needed a high level of adult input. The LEA then interpreted its own words on output to mean 12 and a half hours a week. In effect, the child has received only 12 and a half hours education a week because the school to which he has been assigned has refused to accept him unless he has learning support assistance. I asked the LEA to review that case and I am happy to report that it has now agreed—from 11.30 this morning—that an additional allocation of funding will be made available. I am extremely happy about that, but it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1135</span>
wrong that parents should have to seek the assistance of their Member of Parliament before the proper provision can be made. I hope that the tightening of the statementing process will enable more parents to receive the resources that are theirs by right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention, I said that many local authorities are worried that they will be unable to keep within the specified timetables for providing statements without corresponding duties being placed on social services, health authorities and other agencies. I referred to a six-month period in Cambridgeshire in which 33 statements were started, but only 15 were completed within the statutory time scale because the LEA was waiting for other agencies to complete their reports. That problem must be taken seriously even though this may not be the right place to raise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably have to refer to my good friend the code of practice. I make no apology for that. Most of the points made by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North will be covered by the code of practice. His remarks and some of those of the hon. Member for Cambridge related to the code when they asked whether we shall specify in much more detail what shall be the scope, coverage, nature and detail of statements so that we can overcome the difficulties that have been identified. The answer to their questions is yes but, at this stage, I cannot prejudge the way in which that will be done or the level of detail. That is what we are asking the experts, who we have charged with the responsibility, to do for us. I do not want to prejudge their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister ensure that the needs of the individual child will be paramount in the statementing procedure? Recently, procedures have become resource-led rather than means-led.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a balanced approach. That balance—which we debated not long ago—will, of necessity, reflect the requirements in the clauses that we are shortly to consider and which rightly reflect several factors. The code of practice will be the key to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge asked where responsibility would be in relation to special educational need in a case such as the one she outlined. The answer is provided in clause 144, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body, in the case of a county, voluntary or grant-maintained school, and the local education authority, in the case of a maintained nursery school, shall—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) use their best endeavours, in exercising their functions in relation to the school, to secure that if any registered pupil has special educational needs"</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
and so on.
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the direct answer to the hon. Lady's question is that responsibility would lie with the governing body. If she was asking whether the governors would then be personally liable for compensation, were it to be awarded, the answer is no, because, given the incorporation measures in the Bill, the school funds would provide finance, except in an unusual and exceptional circumstance in which it could be demonstrated that one or more of the governors were acting unreasonably in the discharge of their responsibilities. In that case it is possible that the issue of personal liability might arise. The responsibility is fairly clearly outlined in several places in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
the Bill; Clause 144 the main one. I think that matters will be made clear as we develop the various regulations that will underpin the Bill, the code of practice and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to clause 149 will be the provisions of the code of practice required under clause 140. I must admit that the more we discuss these matters the more one wishes that we had allowed ourselves a little more time to consider clause 140 in some detail. However, I think that we have now managed to allude to it sufficiently. I hope that I have said enough, about the role that we are giving to the code of practice, the mechanisms that we have set up to develop it and the way in which we are going about establishing it, to give the Committee confidence that we shall move ahead in the important matter of the provision of statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, will he confirm that the code of practice will take us away from the concepts of the Education Act 1981 and that the needs of the pupils should be the paramount consideration of statementing procedure, which should not be resource-led? I believe that that was the Minister's other answer to my previous question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not confirm anything of the kind. It may be late at night and I may be taking my eye off the ball occasionally. That is for the Committee to judge. But I shall not fall for that one. The code of practice will do what I have said it will do, but it will reflect the overall objectives as laid out in several different clauses, not Opposition amendments. That, therefore, is that. No matter how often the hon. Member for Warrington, South asks me, and no matter how ingenious the form of words that he uses, unless he waits until much later at night and I am almost asleep, I do not think that he will get that one past me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last remarks have provoked me to say something on clause 149, which deals with the statementing process. It is of fundamental importance that the necessary resources are available to give the statemented provision to a child with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the technical details of individual constituents' complaints about time taken and insufficient attention being given to what parents say, the problem comes down to resources. Interestingly, the Wiltshire LEA, which has a comparatively high percentage of children with statements, nevertheless has had severe problems with children being given statements. One lady wrote to the Minister after the debate on Friday 3 June 1992 and presumably sent copies of her letter to all Members of Parliament who discussed the motion on special educational needs. She wrote in detail about the two years that she had spent trying to obtain a statement from Wiltshire. The week before last, 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> discussed another case from Wiltshire, this time involving a child with dyslexia. Again, a mother had been trying for two years to obtain a proper statement with the resources to back it up. It was only after going to judicial review that anything was done. I pay tribute to voluntary organisations such as the British Dyslexia Association which are taking a positive attitude to testing the 1981 Act in court. At the moment, 120 parents are seeking a judicial review of their children's statements.

informed me. Parents are suffering because of a lack of information and advice. The procedures for dealing with statements are too slow. When the statements come along, they are vague, deliberately so because the authorities do not have to provide the resources required. Parental choices are not accepted and respected because the authorities lack the resources to provide what parents and experts believe is needed. Parents have to find thousands of pounds of their own money to provide for their children's needs. Some have had to sell their homes and in one case, a lady had to rent out her flat to find the money to provide for her child because the LEA would not provide for him. That lady is suing the LEA for failure to meet her child's education needs. The parents in another case informed me that the process simply takes too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many letters from parents throughout the country, including one which arrived this morning. I draw it to the Committee's attention because the case of Desmond Brooking has been publicised in the papers in Wandsworth. The story was headlined
	<br><blockquote><p>"Court to review council ban on help for disabled student".</p></blockquote>
The principal neuropsychologist at a leading London teaching hospital stated his considered opinion in July 1990:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to achieve the best possible progress, Desmond requires help on a one to one basis, in a structured environment, with consistent handling by all teachers. Further, he will require extra time allocation in which to complete work, particularly formal examinations."</p></blockquote>
Against that background, the following was reported in the 	<i>Wandsworth Borough News</i> and confirmed by the child's mother:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Roehampton mother is taking Wandsworth Council to court because it is refusing to provide 'special needs' education for her disabled son. Brenda Brooking, of Danebury Avenue, has been granted a Judicial Review to challenge the council's decision not to give her son Desmond extra coaching. And she has criticised the government for backing Wandsworth in its claim that the 11 year-old does not need extra help.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Desmond was left severely brain-damaged after a car accident three years ago.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>During the remainder of his time at Roehampton Church primary school, he was given six hours' individual coaching a week.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But last summer, before he moved to secondary school, he was assessed by a council education psychologist and Wandsworth terminated the lessons.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In her report psychologist Vivienne Hill wrote: 'Whilst Desmond has made remarkable progress in all areas, he does have some remaining difficulties, which relate to short-term memory and verbal reasoning, for which he should continue to receive individual support.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Wandsworth claims the ADT City Technology College, in West Hill, should be able to provide the required coaching.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But the ADT College, where Desmond has been for a year, estimates he needs 17 hours of specialist support teaching a week, which they cannot give.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In a report to Wandsworth Council, ADT concludes: 'We believe Desmond has made improvements and is well-placed at our college. However it is clear that he requires extra support.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'We are an independent establishment and this means we cannot avail ourselves of the facilities that Wandsworth Authority can offer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'If Desmond were to attend a Wandsworth School, facilities would be available to meet his needs.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Caught up in the row over who should pay for her son's coaching, Mrs. Brooking appealed to the Education Department.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But they decided that extra coaching was up to the ADT College and that Wandsworth should not have to give any additional help.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mrs. Brooking told the WBN: 'My son has spent the whole year now struggling with no help. You can already see the difference in him.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'If he does not get some help with his education where will he be in the future?'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A council spokesman said: 'In the light of more recent information we have received, we are looking at the case again.'"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I referred to that case in detail because it is one in which the Department of Education has also failed the child by refusing to make it clear that he should receive proper educational provision. Unfortunately, he is still awaiting a decision from Wandsworth authority. That is why the resources issue is crucial.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a testimony to the mother's concern is the fact that she has written not only to him but to other hon. Members in the Committee and in the House? The letters are not photocopied but have been individually written. I wonder whether he has in his letter a phrase which will interest members of the Committee, given that the hon. Member for Battersea has said so much about the wonders of Wandsworth council. In her letter to me the mother says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"How Wandsworth can claim to be the Brighter Borough I just do not know. It certainly isn't if you live in it and have problems."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon.

My letter does not contain that description of Wandsworth, although Mrs. Brooking expresses bitterness at having to fight with the authorities. The resources issue is crucial. If we cannot obtain a commitment from the Government to find the necessary money when a statement specifies that a need must be provided, we will be in difficult waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have difficulties with the Government admitting that the needs specified in the statement will be resourced, what will that mean to those many children who have special needs, but who do not have the benefit of the drive that a statement gives? We shall not vote against the clause stand part, but our debate has been important because the Government must understand that the resource issue will not go away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 460, in page 167, line 23, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() An authority issuing a proposed statement to parents of a child starting or transferring school shall issue that proposed statement no later than the first day of the term preceding the term in which the child would start or transfer school.'.</p></blockquote>
Again, this is an important amendment. I refer to work that was conducted by the Independent Panel for Special Educational Advice—IPSEA. It found that increasing numbers of children are without schools to attend at the beginning of each school year, because their LEA issued a draft statement too late in the previous school year for negotiations over its contents to take place. The problem is not the time that assessments take, but the timing of the delivery of a draft statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents' rights to challenge the draft and to appeal against the final form of the statement are intact but, in practice, exercising those rights means that their child may be without a school to attend at the beginning of the next term. In some instances, it will be impossible for LEAs to produce statements that allow parents time to consider their proposals before the deadline of the school starting date or transfer date, for example, if an LEA is not notified of a child's likely need until late in the year before he is due to start at a transfer school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem often affects children, however, who have been known for years to LEAs. It involves cases when the parents' views have also long been known to the LEA and when the LEA has clearly participated in conflict. In such cases, the timing of the delivery of a draft or amended statement can seem to parents, with good reason, to be part of a strategy of pressuring them into agreeing to placement and provision which they do not consider to be in their children's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would cause the LEAs to undertake identification of children coming up to starting or transferring schools, so that assessments can be completed in time for parents to use their rights to challenge them at the draft stage. IPSEA wrote to all LEAs in 1990 about the problem and received assurances from some that they did their best to issue early drafts in such cases. Only one LEA confirmed that it adhered to the 1 May deadline as a matter of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would spread the best of existing practice. That is both possible and desirable and we hope that the Minister will accept it. We acknowledge that it may not be possible in every case, but it should be what authorities aim at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's last few words are quite important and part of what I intend to say will reflect that, although in a different direction. We must be careful lest, in seeking to solve one problem, we create equivalent or even greater difficulties. That could be the result of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of at least part of the Bill is to make the assessment and statementing process shorter, but the amendment could make it longer for children starting or transferring schools. To build in a requirement that a proposed statement must be issued at the beginning of the term before the start or transfer could have the effect of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1140</span>
delay. In other words, the amendment could be seen as putting the cart before the horse and delaying rather than expediting the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If physical adaptations to a school are needed—for example, the installation of ramps—some notice of the child beginning there would be helpful. That applies in a small, but important, number of cases, and in most of them the required notice could be given. Often it becomes clear during the statementing process that a particular placement will be required and a good authority will, with the agreement of the parents, place the child there straight away without necessarily waiting for the process to be completed. That secures the necessary provision at the earliest possible date. Where physical adaptations or other preparations are needed, LEAs will have to be aware of them at an early stage and set in motion the dispositions to make the school ready.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the amendment could catch children who were in the middle of the statementing process but necessarily transferring schools during the ordinary course of their primary or secondary schooling because, for example, their parents were moving from one LEA area to another. In effect, it would mean that the child could not start in the new school at the due time because the LEA would have had to have issued its proposed statement at the beginning of the previous term, which, possibly, it could not have done because it was legitimately not ready to do so. In any case, it would not necessarily have known that the parents were going to move. The amendment might involve a term's delay without any form of flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the amendment's objective but the problem can be solved in a more pragmatic way. More crucially, I believe that it would create more problems than it would solve, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the Minister said about being aware of the problems and his desire for the statementing process to move efficiently, effectively and as quickly as possible, without sacrificing the quality of the statement and the provision. I shall wait to hear his further comments on a code of practice or whatever else he may believe will solve the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this group of amendments is to make a reality of the choice that the Government sought to offer parents of children with special needs in the White Paper and in the Bill. Unfortunately, the choice offered to parents is limited in terms of equal opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The direct right of parents to name a school relates only to maintained or grant-maintained schools. They do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1141</span>
have the right to name a non-maintained or an independent special school, although such schools offer a highly specialised and effective form of special educational provision for children who may have multiple disabilities or severe single disabilities, such as hearing or sight impairment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill there is a fallback, allowing the offer of a place in a non-maintained or independent school to be secured through the statement or through the statement in process. However, choice is not offered to parents in the same way as it is in the case of maintained and grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the maintained and special schools sector, there are schools for deaf-blind children, for children with severe challenging behaviour and learning difficulties and for profoundly multiply handicapped children who require a much longer educational day to develop. All these schools' specialism and expertise is of an extremely high standard. I have been inundated with letters from non-maintained and independent special schools about their fear that the Bill makes them second-class citizens. Instead of being able to knock at the same door as maintained or grant-maintained schools, they will have to go round to the tradesmen's entrance and hope for the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the galaxy of Government new clauses on another aspect of special schools, I hope that the Government will accept our amendments and recognise that, although in many cases residential provision is involved—it is obviously more expensive than day-care provision in maintained or grant-maintained schools—the high degree of specialism means that for most of the pupils at those schools a residential place is necessary. I hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider the issue of non-maintained and independent special schools and accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a supreme irony in the amendment that will not have escaped the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. If I were to suggest that parents had the right to choose a mainstream independent school and have their child attend it at the taxpayers' expense, I should get relatively short shrift from Labour members of the Committee. I say that not to make any cheap political point, although I am always happy to make political points, and the cheaper the better. At this time of night they come very cheaply. But I make the point because there is virtue in consistency in policy and politics, and we must look for it here too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I yield to none in my admiration for the work done by non-maintained and independent special schools. I have visited some and hope to visit many more. I freely acknowledge the superb work that they do, which is beyond challenge. Their position is secure, because they are convinced that not only is their provision of the best and their reputation unequalled but their provision is almost certainly cheaper than that of most maintained special schools. So those schools can look to the future with great confidence; but I must ask the Committee to stop short of including an absolute right for a parent to name a school outside the maintained sector for his or her child. I freely concede that that is because of principle and precedent, but its effect will not be traumatic and damaging, as has been claimed by many of the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the hon. Member for Bridgend has been inundated with letters. I expect that most Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column'>1142</span>
members of the Committee have been as well, because I have been approached by most of them on the issue and I know the strength of feeling that exists. As I have told my hon. Friends before, although the Bill does not give parents the right to name special schools outside the maintained sector, schedule 9, paragraph 5(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A parent on whom a copy of a proposed statement has been served under paragraph 2 above may—
	<br><blockquote><p>make representations (or further representations) to the local education authority about the content of the statement".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
In other words, if the local education authority has not seen fit to name a non-maintained or independent special school in the statement and the parent believes that such a school would best meet his child's needs, the parent is free to appeal to the tribunal, which can make a binding ruling that names a school outside the maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members, I have received a letter from the Northern County School For the Deaf in Newcastle. Many years ago I visited that school when on a course at Newcastle polytechnic. It was an excellent school then, and I assume that it still is. In an area such as the north-east of England, where the Northern County School for the Deaf has been the accepted school to which to send children with that disability, what will happen about recommendations if the amendment is not accepted? Is not it easier to include it in the Bill so that the LEA knows where to send a child with such a disability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister looks confused. If it is not an accepted school, written into the Bill, the local authority might not want to send the child there. Should not that specific kind of school be mentioned in the Bill, so that the authority knows where to send particular children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that. Local authorities frequently refer children with special educational needs to these schools and they will be free to continue to do so after the Bill becomes law. There will be no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I maintain that there is a difference between giving parents a right in statute to express their choice for a school outside the maintained sector and for one within. I wish to uphold that principle. If parents decide to exercise their rights of appeal to the tribunal—as set out in the Bill—and, having studied the evidence, the tribunal decides that a certain school is the best provider, the school must remain confident that it will prove to be the best provider. That is partly because of the excellence of such schools' provision and reputation, and partly because of their confidence that their provision will be less costly than that in the maintained special sector. I refer the Committee to the confidence of the schools in themselves, as expressed to me and to others. On appeal, the tribunal has the power to make its ruling in favour of one of these schools, even though the LEA has decided against supporting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears of the schools—understandable though they may have been—have been unfounded. I hope that my remarks will make the Opposition reconsider the Bill, which will be a sufficient safeguard. I ask the Committee—maybe Opposition Members more than others—to consider carefully the implications of their remarks and the precedent that they may, rather interestingly, be setting. My colleagues and I may wish to ponder it and come up with another proposition that may be attractive to us and about which we may wish to appeal to Opposition Members. But that will be for another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1143</span>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. In doing so, we shall give important schools which are vital to the provision of special education needs real assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I must respond to the Minister's remarks. To equate non-maintained special schools and independent special schools within the network of the independent sector with state support, is to miss the point completely. Those schools provided a highly specialised service when LEAs were not even thinking about such provision. Because they were the pioneers, the LEAs have accepted that, from time to time, pupils in their areas will benefit from placements in such schools. Any analogy with the independent sector and the major public schools would involve going back to the original purposes for which those schools were founded. Most public schools were founded to provide education for poor children in the locality. Defining who should go to those schools is a subject for another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some degree the non-maintained and independent special schools can say that they provide such a good service that they should survive even though they are treated as second-class citizens in respect of parental choice. However, for children with specific learning difficulties which are not generally dealt with in the maintained sector—for example, children with severe hearing impairment—almost half of the specialist provision is to be found in independent or non-maintained special schools. They are an important sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think again. His political analogy does not hold up. There is a case for grant-maintained non-maintained special schools and independent special schools having a similar regime for parental choice. The local authorities already find places in those schools, so there is no ideological hang-up about them, even though the Minister might like us to have one. We should consider this issue again on Report. Meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is evidence that some local authorities—by no means all of them—use the amendment procedure as a fast track means of changing provisions specified in children's statements, of avoiding the need to obtain multi-professional advice on their needs and of avoiding having to allow parents paragraph 7 rights to challenge the newly drafted statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems arise when the amendment procedures are used to make a substantive change in the description of the child's needs or in the type or amount of provision to be made. It is clearly unsatisfactory to use the amendment procedure to put into effect changes of provision which LEAs know parents will almost certainly want to challenge. In those instances, they will not have been able to draw on professional advice to help resolve disputes in the child's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would compel LEAs to copy to all parents the professional advice taken into account when reaching the decision to propose an amendment. Parents may appeal to the tribunal against an amendment to their child's statement, and they need to know the grounds on which the proposal is being made to judge whether an appeal would be in the interests of their child. Making available to parents all the professional advice used for an amendment to the statement will help to resolve disputes before they go to a tribunal. The amendment to paragraph 11(1)(a) of schedule 9 would reduce the number of unnecessary appeals that go to tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the advantage of the authority sharing with the parents the essential facts and reasons behind their decisions. All good LEAs do that, or should do that, anyway. However, at the point at which the first amendment is inserted, the authority has made not a decision, but merely a proposal. LEAs will say why they propose to amend the statement, which will be for good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
reasons in the majority of cases. If parents disagree, they already have full rights to make representations to the authority under paragaph 11(2) of the schedule. I agree that, as part of any subsequent discussion, the LEA should try to accommodate parents' wishes as far as possible and to share with them the information that has led to the amendment to the statement being proposed. The Committee agreed in a debate on an earlier amendment that partnership is always important. Given good will and reasonable communication, parents should understand and be party to an authority's decision or proposal—they will share its ownership. However, the final decision as to whether an amendment is needed to a statement will be the authority's. It must take into account all relevant advice, evidence and information, and exclude that which it considers to be irrelevant, misleading or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority must also decide whether an assessment is necessary. Our code of practice will establish criteria and guidance to which authorities will have to have regard. Those criteria will make the authority more accountable to parents. The authority must already present its decisions, and its reasoning, to the parents. Parents' consequent rights to appeal are based on the decision and the associated explanation. I agree that it is good practice for LEAs to give parents detailed reasons for decisions, drawing on the available evidence, advice and information. We shall consider the matter further in the context of departmental guidance in the new code or elsewhere, as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that parents may request an assessment at any time, unless one has been undertaken within the previous six months. In many cases, any amendment made to a statement will follow a reassessment. In those circumstances, parents will not have the right to request the further assessment intimated by the amendment, because clause 153(1)(b) removes that right if an assessment was carried out in the previous six months. However, the Bill includes full provision for parents to make representations if they wish. Under the new procedures, LEAs will not amend statements without careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the new code and guidance are in place, LEAs generally will make amendments, or propose to do so, when they have information arising from an assessment or a review, or have some other indication that an amendment to the statement is in the child's interest. In most cases parents are likely to agree. When they do not, they will have a right of appeal under paragraph 11(4) of schedule 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delaying procedure contained in the proposed new subparagraph, which would apply to children starting or transferring school, would prevent the implementation of amendments to statements even when it was known that changes in provision were indubitably necessary and urgent. LEAs must act as soon as they recognise that there is a need to amend a statement. Given that they have that duty, to require that an amendment to a statement must be issued at the beginning of the term before the child starts or transfers school would have the effect of delaying fulfilment of that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the needs are identified, the provisions are agreed and the placement is made, the amendment to a statement will follow, if necessary and in the light of experience. Ordinary transfers, such as from primary to secondary school, will take place when they are due. That is how the procedure will work.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 673 gives parents the specific right to appeal against the needs described in the statement of their child's special educational needs. We believe that there should be such a right. The assessment of a child's needs and their accurate description is fundamental to the ability of the LEA to specify the special educational provisions that are right for the child. If that is wrong, the value of the statement as a document to help the LEA and schools to make the proper provision diminishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have advocated this new right of appeal. I believe that parents will welcome it and I hope that members of the Committee will too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments would require LEAs to make amendments to the statement. They would have to tell parents of their clear and statutory right to appeal against the special educational needs, as well as against the special educational provision, including the absence of any named school. Where parents appeal against an LEA's proposal to cease to maintain a statement and the tribunal orders the LEA to continue to maintain it with certain amendments, those amendments could, if the tribunal saw fit, relate to the special educational needs as well as to the provision and could embrace other consequential amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment requires LEAs to tell parents of their new right to appeal against the special educational needs in addition to the provision in those instances where the LEA has amended the statement. I commend these detailed but important amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is designed to tidy up the grammar of lines 19 and 20. I am sure that this Committee, of all Committees, would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 672 is to make clear parents' rights to appeal to the special educational needs tribunal against the authority's description of special educational needs in the statement, as well as the special educational provision and the tribunal's right to order the LEA to amend either or both. As has been said in the courts in relation to appeals under section 8 of the Education Act 1981, although the appeal is against the special educational provision only, that provision must be appropriate to the needs of the child. If it is wholly inappropriate for the child an appeal will lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example given is of a child who is suffering from brain damage but has been wrongly assessed as being blind, for which the appropriate provision might be tuition in Braille. It is no answer to an appeal against the provision of tuition in Braille to say that it is appropriate for a blind child and that it is only the assessment of need that is wrong. The provision for that child's need is wholly inappropriate. That shows the limited and indirect extent to which a parent might now appeal to correct a wrong assessment which has called into question the inappropriate special educational provision specified in his child's statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides parents with a clear, specific and wider right of appeal against the special educational needs described in the statement. It provides, sensibly, that the right to appeal does not obtain where amendments to the statement are made following changes to the named school, following an earlier appeal by the parents on that point, where the tribunal has ordered the LEA to keep the statement but make certain amendments, following a proposal from the authority to cease to maintain the statement, and in pursuance of a school attendance order in respect of which other procedures for taking into account the views of parents apply. The will be no further right of appeal where there has already been a determination on appeal by the tribunal following an LEA assessment but no amendment to the statement. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee of the virtues of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
