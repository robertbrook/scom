	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Sir John, back to the Committee. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear,"] It is good to start on a note of agreement—an unusual occurrence in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education will explain the Government's thinking behind clause 65, which, like the other clauses listed for debate today, raises significant and detailed questions. It provides for the replacement of
	<br><q><p>"proposed initial first or foundation governors before incorporation"</p></q>
in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the Bill, or other regulations, must cover every eventuality and so must contain a provision such as clause 65. However, the question arises as to who should nominate governors in such circumstances. In addition, who should nominate the governors of the grant-maintained school in the first place? The proposal that a small group of people whether it be the governing body that exists before the move to grant-maintained status, or, in the case of a voluntary aided school, the foundation—should determine who the new governors of the grant-maintained school will be reveals a narrow view of what a school is about. The provisions in the clause replicate those in other legislation, but they exhibit that narrowness of view of who should be responsible for appointing a school's governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members agree that the role of a governing body is very important, as are the nominations to it. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that a governing body should represent a community as widely as possible. That may not always happen if an existing governing body nominates its successors. Although that may not appear to be the biggest problem with the Bill, it is indicative of the approach adopted by Ministers in the weeks of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
The move to grant-maintained status is very important. Opposition Members do not welcome it. However, if it is to happen, we must ensure that the right people become school governors. By "right people", I mean people who have an overview of what is involved in education, not people who represent various narrow interests. The governing body of a school that has sought grant-maintained status may have been split on that matter. Perhaps only part of the governing body will be willing to serve on or suggest nominations for the successor body. That would be a shame and would mean that the new governing body would be narrowly constituted. I hope that the Minister would not be happy with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For grant-maintained schools to be successful, their governing bodies should represent a wide range of people. I am worried that the clause provides that only a narrow range of people will choose the governors of a new grant-maintained school. I hope that the Minister will, from the outset, state that members of governing bodies should represent wider interests and experiences. The clause focuses on what would happen in specific circumstances, however, its principles apply to the entire Bill. It highlights the problems that we should tackle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a privilege to speak before you, Sir John, for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) has exposed a difficulty that has been caused by rapid consideration of prior clauses during the previous sitting. Her points apply to earlier clauses, however, as she said, the principle behind the clause applies to the entire Bill, for example, clause 68, which deals with initial governors for new grant-maintained schools. The hon. Lady's argument deserves a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65, in accordance with the precedent set by the Education Reform Act 1988, provides for the replacement of proposed initial governors in the case of casual vacancies between nomination and the implementation of the proposals. Such vacancies could be caused by death, disqualification or withdrawal. I am sure that the Committee will not wish to resile from that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, and its concepts, in a narrow compass, are consistent with the 1988 Act. We have had experience of the implementation of that Act and the hon. Lady's fears have not been borne out. The establishment of first governors, their work on behalf of the school and the community, and the role of grant-maintained schools in the community have been positive. It is our intention and profound wish to replicate that under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dewsbury rightly said that nominations to the governing body are important. They should not be taken lightly. Existing governors will take account of that as they nominate the first
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
governors of the new school. In considering how that should be done, there is a dissonance or tension between two views of the governors. First, they have certain duties, which we would all agree are extremely important. Whether or not they are in sympathy with the grant-maintained philosophy, although I imagine that they will be, the governors have a duty to the school. I am sure that, as well as carrying out their more precise duties, they will do their best to ensure that the school fulfils its role in the community. Secondly, in the view of what the hon. Member for Dewsbury, said, the governors should represent the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we created a shopping list of all the possible interests in the community and sought to replicate them in the governing body, we would either find the task impossible or the school would be unmanageable because of the many interests for which we sought to cater. In the clause, based on the precedent of the 1988 Act, we wish to find a balance between prior representative interests, the need to run the school in an effective manner and the duties of governors, whoever they are, to that school. I believe that we have the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the first governors—both the initial ones and those who may succeed them—should include two representatives of parents from the school. Together with their children, parents are, after all, customers of the school and therefore, should be represented among the first governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it does not arise in the clause, the hon. Member for Dewsbury will be aware of the provisions for teacher governors, including the head teacher. The main interests of the school are directly represented on the governing body; that mechanism has proved to be successful under the terms of the 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult to accommodate wider representation of interests, whether or not it arises directly on the stand part debate. I agree with the hon. Member for Dewsbury that it is important and desirable—and from the evidence it is happening—that governing bodies should represent their school and its interests. They should seek to do that in the context of the wider community and the public interest. The evidence that we put forward in our previous sitting suggests that a positive role is already being played by grant-maintained schools with such a constitution in the work of the community. I have addressed the hon. Lady's general considerations and I take them to be in sympathy with the clause, which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ELECTIONS AND APPOINTMENTS REQUIRED FOR
<br><br><!-- lb --> DETERMINING INITIAL GOVERNORS OF AN ELECTED CATEGORY:SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is aware, clause 66 regulates the election of parents and teachers governors, when a school decides to become grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must take issue with a word that the Minister used a few minutes ago, when he talked about us being reassured about the responsibilities that the governing body will feel to the community because of the election to it of two parents. He used the word, "customers", which reveals a lot of what is wrong with the Government's approach to education. Education is not a commodity—it is far more important than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the absence from the clause of any provision for the election of support-staff governors on initial governing bodies. Those of us who know about what takes place in schools know that non-teaching staff in primary and secondary schools make a considerable contribution. Provision for support staff to be elected in the same way as teachers would strengthen governing bodies and the position of schools overall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the contribution to school life that so many different staff make. Heads and teachers are our first focus of attention, but we should acknowledge and appreciate the contribution of support staff—caretakers, laboratory assistants, dinner ladies and the like. All add something to a school's ethos and contribute to its well-being. They also have experience and understanding of the practical working of a school. Their informal discussions with pupils and parents can be most reassuring. We should include provision for that in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the support staff often reflect the local community because they usually reside close to the school? They can therefore provide an added dimension to the understanding of young people in their area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It would be reassuring for us all if the contribution that support staff make to a school was recognised. Many parents find it easy to talk to support staff about school matters, especially if they lack confidence, because they consider that to be less formal than talking to a head or a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is willing to acknowledge the role of support staff, but that is not enough. He should also concede that those staff play
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>859</span>
such a significant role that there should be provision for their election as governors at the initial stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has acknowledged that a school that is on the point of moving to grant-maintained status is going through a critical time. Therefore it is important that the governing body is as strong as possible. Incorporating support staff, through election, would strengthen such bodies. Although we are opposed to schools becoming grant maintained, if they are to do so, their governing bodies must be as representative as possible so that parents and the community can have full confidence in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to you, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury about the importance of support staff. I speak from experience of working with support staff on governing bodies who were co-opted as governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have sent their children to state schools, especially in the primary sector, appreciate the important role that people, such as school dinner ladies and cleaners, play in the running of the school. My son was very disorganised in his primary school years. He regularly lost bits of paper, precious books or photographs that he had taken to school to show his friends. We inevitably turned to the school cleaner and the midday supervisor for help. One should not underestimate the valuable part that those people play: they are part of the school community. They get an overall view of the school, perhaps more so than the teaching staff who are primarily concerned with their own class of children. They usually know all the parents and children well, especially in the primary sector where schools are smaller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of school cleaners has been diminished in recent years by the inevitable privatisation as a result of the Government's policy on compulsory competitive tendering. I do not want you to think, Sir John, that I am straying from the amendment, but I must point out the damage that has inevitably been done. In Cambridgeshire, before school cleaning was privatised, we had a wonderful set of school cleaners who were often intimately associated with the schools in which they worked. Their children had attended the school in the past; sometimes they were grandparents of children at the school. They played an important part in integrating the school into the community. Those people should have the opportunity and the right to become a governor of a grant-maintained school. That would preserve the community spirit and help the school to feel part of the whole community. That has not happened in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of a special school whose cook is on the governing body as a co-opted governor. Her role is valuable because she believes that meal time is an important activity for children with special educational needs. It gives them a chance to meet together, to co-operate and to communicate with each
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
other and with members of the teaching and support staff. She takes great delight in producing different meals of different ethnic origins on different days of the week because she regards that as a valuable part of the education process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Minister to reconsider the clause and to give support staff a statutory right to sit on governing bodies in their own right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disappointing that the Government have a blinkered approach to the appointment of initial governors for grant-maintained schools. There are reserved places for certain categories of people—sponsor governors, parents and teachers—but the support staff of the school are omitted. Those members of the Committee who take an interest in the Register of Members' Interests will know that my constituency Labour party is sponsored by the National Union of Public Employees, so I have a personal interest because many of its members work as support staff in schools. They have a sense of pride in the work of the schools, even though they are not members of the teaching staff. They believe that they have an important role to play in the education system. They do not like to be regarded as second-class citizens. The wording of the clause makes them feel like that because it does not give them reserved places as it does teachers; they argue that non-teaching staff should not be treated in such a detrimental manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that many support staff are co-opted to a governing body. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) said, many governing bodies co-opt a member of the non-teaching staff to the governing body, but it should not be left to co-option. A school's support staff should be treated on an equal footing with the teaching staff: a place should be available for them on the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a blinkered, collegiate approach to the delivery of education at present. It is an artificial approach to make a division between teaching and non-teaching staff. Those of us with long experience of schools know that probably the most important and influential person in the school is not the head teacher but the caretaker. Nothing much can be done in a school without the caretaker's agreement. That reflects the significance of support staff in some schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to read the Secretary of State's proposals yesterday for primary education. It was suggested that perhaps the days of the class teacher in primary schools are coming to an end and that in future, teachers may work alongside support staff in the classroom, creating an environment that is quite different from the traditional one. It therefore becomes difficult to make an arbitrary and artificial distinction between teachers and other staff in a school. The clause as drafted makes that artificial distinction, and we should reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>861</span>
Proper consideration should be given to providing reserve places for non-teaching staff. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) said, non-teaching staff who live locally and are part of the local community are often the first to hear if there is dissatisfaction and anxiety about a school's direction. Many teachers at schools in inner-city areas drive to work from outlying, leafy communities, which bear no relation to the community in which the school is situated. Teachers can be seen driving to school in the morning, while the support staff live close enough to walk; they are part of the local community. For those reasons, it is important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks about teachers driving to school from leafy suburbs and the support staff walking from their own neighbourhood. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that teachers can now do as he describes shows the Government's concern to increase teachers' remuneration? Will he join me in congratulating the Government on the fact that the average teacher now earns in excess of £20,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows all too well that, when the Prime Minister set up the independent School Teachers Pay Review Body 18 months ago, he made a commitment that school teachers would no longer drive clapped-out saloons. But they are still driving those cars. In the next 12 months they may not be able to afford to do so because they will be restricted to a 1.5 per cent. pay increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that the hon. Gentleman was provoked, but he is going wide of the dabate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for succumbing to temptation, Sir John, but I wanted to have that interesting debate with the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) as many points need to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should value non-teaching staff, who have a valuable role in our schools. They come from the community and are part of it, and they are part of the learning process. The clause as drafted ignores that and, principally for that reason, it should not be part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join other members of the Committee in welcoming you back, Sir John, not least because you see the way in which what I say always relates to the topic under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support strongly what my hon. Friends have said. Let me take the Committee back to the days that the Secretary of State views as halcyon days, when I helped to establish a large comprehensive, which took over from many through schools attended by children
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
from the ages of five to 14. The Secretary of State remembers as golden days the days when lads of 12, 13 or 14 who had difficulty reading and writing were not stretched by such subjects but did gardening instead—which often helped the head of the school to live splendidly on the vegetables that they produced. Those pupils performed a fine task, and I understand why the Secretary of State wants a better quality of cabbage these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was difficult to turn that culture round to the more academic atmosphere, self-discipline and respect for other people that comprehensive education offered. I hate to say this, but pupils had been accustomed to going into the lavatory to smoke during every break. That habit was difficult to crack because the comprehensive brought in pupils from seven disparate schools, each with its own smoking habits. It is clearly undesirable to permit smoking in schools and it was necessary to use not just teachers but ancillary staff to stop it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school's splendid caretaker at that time was Bill Comboy who was awarded the British Empire Medal last year—I shall not say anything about that. He thoroughly deserved his medal because he was an integral part of the school and was far more important to the welfare of the lads who had been cast aside from the educational system at the time than I was. He could take them away for weekends to ensure that they looked anew on life and on their responsibilities and to encourage them to think that learning, reading, writing and discussing were worth while. Mr. Comboy gathered together a team of cleaners. I hope that, under the new dispensation, they will not be sold off like slaves to some French cleaning firm. Contracting out for cleaning breaks the loyalty link with cleaners in the school. The managing directors of the cleaning firm or the gardening firm may be elected as ancillary members of staff. That is one of my misgivings about our suggestions and should not happen. The cleaning, gardening and general appearance of a school set the tone for the learning that takes place there. It is crucial that people such as gardeners and cleaners work as a team and are not excluded from consideration when governors are elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the last school to whose governing body I belonged—Carleton high school in Pontefract—the caretaker was always on the board of governors. She made a superb contribution and, in discussions, saved us much work of the kind on which previously we had frittered away time because we did not have the expertise of those who looked after the fabric of the school, which is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put in a word for dinner ladies. Places such as Derbyshire are being lambasted for what they have done to school meal provision. Derbyshire may have gone slightly over the top—I make no comment on that—but it is equally true that the importance of meal times in schools is being underestimated. There was a time when manners were taught during school meals. That was in the tradition of English education.

School meal times are often the only times when children sit down with a knife and fork and eat in that time-revered fashion, as opposed to sitting with a plate on the knee, looking at the television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good behaviour in school dinner halls—which were not streamed, or set, but all mixed ability, which would not please the Secretary of State for Education—depended very much upon the quality of the dinner ladies. They knew that they were part of a team.

I ask the Minister, who is a reasonable man, to recall his Aristotle and to recognise that that democracy is best to which all people contribute, and to ensure that the legislation allows ancillary staff to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friends. While listening to the debate I was thinking of my experience as head of a special school in Durham, or in Spennymoor, which is part of Durham County. I had not intended to speak in the debate, but I began to think of what happened in that school and to make notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the school were a head teacher—myself—90 to 100 children, a deputy head and eight teachers. I also jotted down notes on what support staff we had. There were a cook, two assistant cooks, three cleaners, a caretaker, two welfare assistants and a secretary. That amounted to 10—more support staff than teachers. We also, of course, had ground staff to take care of the playing field, but they were based, not at the school, but with the local authority. They came to school several times a week and kept the grounds in perfect condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made notes about the governing body of the school. I was on it and there was a teacher representative, but there was no representation of the support staff. I think now that that was a great error. I realise the mistake that we made. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) was correct. All the teachers came to school in cars, simply because they lived further away from the school than they were able to walk—they did not necessarily come from leafy suburbs. Of the 10 support staff, the three ladies who worked in the kitchen, the three cleaners and my secretary all walked to school, because they lived a short distance from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now realise that the six support staff members who walked to work took an active role not only in the school—which could not have been run without them—but in the community. They were members of voluntary organisations, local clubs and the community in general. In many cases they involved their organisations with the school. Often I visited organisations to talk about the school and, on many occasions, to plead for funds. Not only were those support staff members working at the school during the day, they were also thinking about it and working for it during leisure activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend remember the debate last week about the number of grant—maintained schools that would look after facilities that were for dual use and to which the community is offered access? He has just said that support staff are very much members of the community so does he accept that they would add an extra dimension from the school's point of view and, in the discharge of functions about dual use and the community provision of the school, they would add a most valuable additional perspective? As my hon. Friend said, support staff are intergrated members of the community in a way that other members of the staff often are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend reminds me of that valid point and of the debate that we had. My point is that my support staff were perhaps—I say this without being unprofessional and with great respect to the teaching staff—more interested in the well-being of the school than the teaching staff might have been. The support staff became very much involved with the school in their outside activities. They were an integral pasrt of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the support staffs role in the school both during and after school hours, it is rather crass that they are not represented on the school's governing body. I have realised that that is the case from this morning's debate and it has reminded me that, when I was a head teacher a few years ago, I persuaded the governors and the local authority to co-opt one of the support staff on to the board of governors. That person had an excellent and valuable contribution to make to the work of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Memebers for Wallsend and for Cambridge discussed the role of support staff. The old joke is that the caretaker ran the school. Billy Connolly, the comedian, made a record about that called "The Janitor", as the caretaker is known in Scotland. That joke is perfectly true. In my school, the caretaker would meet me at the entrance to the school to report whether we had had a break-in, the plans for the day and what he would and would not allow. For example, he would tell me that the children were not to be allowed out because it was too wet and he did not want his floors dirty or that it was possible for me to let them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of my political activities, I spent a considerable amount of time out of school. Although my deputy head was excellent, my secretary knew the ins and outs of the school, and I am ashamed to say that I suspect that she ran the school when I was not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support staff are important people within a school, which cannot operate without them. My welfare staff were as good as teachers. They were so effective that I tried to persuade them to take extra qualifications so that they could become teachers. However, none of the people to whom I have referred were on the school's governing body. The more I think about that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
the more I view it as disgraceful. They had a huge and important role to play in the school and they should have been on the governing body because they had a contribution to make to it and to the running of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate gives us the opportunity to ensure that support staff are represented on governing bodies. I hope that the Government take note of what has been said and make provision for that group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This interesting debate forms a piece with the exchanges on clause 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matters debated are difficult to relate to clause 66, which has some highly technical implementing provisions governing the rules and the role of the LEA and existing governing bodies in relation to the election of parent and teacher governors. I have no objection to the debate, but if the elections are to be properly conducted, the Committee should accept the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has opened up a most interesting debate about the role of support staff in schools. I hope that Opposition Members who have spoken in the debate will not feel any discomfort if I say that I accept the spirit of many of their remarks, but do not concur with the conclusions that they have drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two reservations about their remarks. First, the hon. Member for Dewsbury castigated me for using the word "customer". I defend that use robustly. Parents have a unique and central place in the role and management of schools. One hopes that parents are the natural parents, but that, sadly, is not always the case, as I well know. Nevertheless, the natural parents or those who have custody of children and are responsible for their upbringing have a particular role, just as a child has only one education, which is a point that I often dwell on. Parents are of central importance to the welfare of a child and Government members of the Committee firmly believe that that should be reflected in the administrative and governance arrangements made for a school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister acknowledge that no Opposition Member was suggesting that parents should not have a role on the governing body? We accept that without question. The Minister gave us the image of parents as being responsible for shopping around for the best school and then leaving education to the teachers, and we object to that. Would not it be healthier if the Minister saw parents as entering into a partnership with a school for the good of the children rather than use the word "customer"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, we are entering into a semantic argument. [Hon. Members: "No."] Well, the hon. Lady asked me to change the term that I used. For the hon. Lady's benefit, I am sure that Opposition Members accept the role and responsibility of parents
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
as part of the governance of a school. I am delighted that they do. We may differ. We believe that such a role is central and that is reflected in the administrative arrangements set up in the Education Reform Act 1988 and largely replicated in the clause. We defend that. The child is central—that is right. The parents stand in for children and act as their advocates. They should have the prior say, but that is not to gainsay that there are other interests. I shall discuss them after the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright), who quite properly and enjoyably quoted Aristotle, has intervened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister aware that parental involvement in schools and education goes back to the late 1950s and early 1960s, when it was condemned as trendy? That word is used rather a lot these days, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that as the Under-Secretary of State for Education for Further and Higher Education, I have an interest in such involvement continuing. We can all learn from our experiences. I hope that Opposition Members will learn from theirs as I have done my best to learn from mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to discover what "customer" means. The Minister exposed the Government's position by using that word to express how he views the role of parents. Customers are part of the social market, to which the Government give a great deal of credence. Does the Minister agree that the customer should have freedom of choice in the market? Do parents have such a freedom when selecting a school or can they merely express a preference with there being no guarantee that that preference will be agreed to? That would mean that it is incorrect to describe parents as customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not often cross swords with the hon. Gentleman but I must say that that is a little rich coming from the Opposition. I am pleased to say that the Government have pioneered the implementation of a philosophy that includes more open enrolment and a general relaxation of tight catchment area conditions. That may be peripheral to the clause, but, given the importance of the parental role, we are doing our best to ensure that parents' wishes are met wherever possible. It is more relevant to the clause to note that those wishes are reflected in the governance arrangements for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of a distinguished intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, Conservative Members have not joined in this argument. Of course we recognise the importance of manual workers and support staff in a school. May of my hon. Friends, like myself, have been governors or managers of maintained schools. We know that may of the points made by anecdote are germane—if anything, they do not do justice to the great army of people who assist in the practical management of schools. We often encounter the same problems in the House: Members of Parliament stand up front and receive the brickbats or the applause, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
we know that we are served by a great army of people. Sometimes, we should stand back and think about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that with feeling, as I have experienced manual work to an extent that perhaps it not shared by all hon. Members in the Committee. I have worked alongside blue-collar workers. I have done the same work as they and know that that work, although necessary, is neither easy nor always pleasant. Gradually, however, that is changing and I agree with those hon. Members who said that such work is not simply a matter of hewing wood and drawing water. People who do such work can influence the running, discipline, general tone and self-image of a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall a little rhyme published in the vestry of my church about the volunteers who polish the pews, put the books in order and so on. I cannot quote it exactly, but that rhyme calls such people the silent heroes of the organisation and activity of the church. I readily pay tribute to the people who do similar work in schools, and know that the Committee will join me in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that the ancillary staff in a school are silent heroes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants me to say that, I shall. I do not mean that such staff, as with any body of human beings, do not contain some stroppy or difficult members. However, most will get on with their jobs and do them well. They are essential to the operation of the organisation. Why should I dissent from that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives a new dimension to the adage that some people should be seen and not heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly dispute that. Sometimes we need to record that we are sensitive to such matters. I make no apology for doing so. However, it is one thing to acknowledge the role of such workers, as I do readily, but it is another to try to incorporate in the clause a special provision for them to be involved directly in the governance of a school. I invite the Committee to accept the clause and resist that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing so, I wish to raise a number of arguments and points of principle. First, we believe that parents have a unique and central interest which other people, including support staff, do not. Secondly, we believe that teachers have a professional interest. Without dwelling on that point, I noticed, rather wryly, that when Opposition Members were deploying their point about support staff, they were almost having to say that support staff were more important than teachers. I do not believe that they would want to argue that—I certainly would not. The teachers have a direct, central interest and a professional competence, which we acknowledge in our arrangements for governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister please convey those sentiments to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so with enthusiasm, if that is what the hon. Gentleman wishes. The fact that not all teachers are perfect does not mean that they do not have a central, professional role. I hope that they will live up to that in their decisions on current matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Committee to dwell on some practical matters. The first is the simple, compelling argument, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." We have the experience of the Education Reform Act 1988 and similar provisions are included in the Bill. No material evidence suggests that the problems and difficulties of support staff have not been acknowledged in our arrangements, so I do not think that we should change them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute many of the Minister's points about the central importance of teachers and parents because they are widely accepted. But, should take the phrase, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" a little further and say, "If it ain't broke, could we improve it?" The inclusion of non-teaching staff on a governing body would be an improvement on the way in which schools are governed. The Minister talked of silent heroes: perhaps we can accept heroes, but why silent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience, it has always been possible, and it has normally been the case, for support staff who have particular points to raise to make their opinions known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should resist the seductive arguments of the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope). The present Government arrangements have worked and have enabled the interests of support staff to be reflected. Sometimes what might be termed titular membership is similar to the decision to appoint a statutory woman to a board to ensure that there are no arguments. If we simply say that many people should be shoved onto a governing body, there is always the danger that building in membership and trying to satisfy interests by such a device could be a substitute for consultation. One should not confuse the interests of management with the interests of those people who are managed or employed at a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be represented on the governing body? The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) spoke eloquently of the responsible role of support staff, particularly in the type of school of which he was head. But, within the electoral college, if it is set up, we must consider who will be represented and who will represent the others. I have jotted down a few categories and, I can think of a school bursar in a large school and administrators, among others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Friday, I had the opportunity of visiting the professional development centre nearest to me, which is in Brackley, in my constituency. It is pioneering a new diploma through Leicester university, for school administrators and secretaries. It claims that it is an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
innovation. I welcome that important component in the professional development of support staff. The hon. Member for City of Durham gave a list of such staff, including bursars, administrators, secretaries, technicians, cooks, cleaners, janitors and caretakers. That is a long list and it is not self-evident that those people share the same interests, for which one person could cater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hemsworth knows from his earlier classical reference, if we leave aside the contiuation of slavery in ancient Athens, a participant body of all electors or citizens existed there to decide every matter. A school cannot be run in that way. If we move to mass representation and try to cater for every interest, where will that end? Such an attempt would affect the size of the governing body. The proposal would result in appointing an extra governor. If we retain our philosophy of maintaining a majority of first governors, some of whom may be parents, the proposal would require a further increase in such governors. In my experience, the bigger the committee, the less vibrant and effective its decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee to support the clause and to reject organised representation for support staff, for practical reasons and on grounds of principle. I yield to no one in my respect and admiration for support staff who serve our schools. Their interests would not be served by the proposals that have been suggested today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 66 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 67</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INITIAL SPONSOR GOVERNORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my brief comments on clause 67, I need to refer to clause 58, which allows two sorts of sponsorship: school sponsors and sponsor governors. Clause 67 refers only to sponsor governors and it gives the Secretary of State power, by regulation, to approve sponsor governors. No such power exists to approve a sponsor of a grant-maintained secondary school. If sponsor governors are so beneficial to a school, why is the primary sector excluded? The Minister's explanation will be interesting. Any benefits that accrue from sponsorship would surely apply to both secondary and the primary sectors. However, the Government believe that the initiative should cover only the secondary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 67 provides that the Secretary of State, by regulation, can determine who will become one of the four initial sponsor governors. Such approval is not required for a school sponsor, a person deemed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
inappropriate to be a sponsor governor could sponsor a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that there can be corporate sponsors. British Airways, for example, could sponsor a school but, perhaps because of recent court proceedings, it may be felt inappropriate for Lord King to be an initial sponsor governor. His company could sponsor the school but that would not be a matter for the Secretary of State because the clause refers to sponsor governors only. The governors nominated by the company might be deemed inappropriate. The distinction seems strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as drafted gives the governor no power to disapprove of a school's sponsor although it does give a power relating to sponsor governors. Approval might have been thought possible for both types of sponsorship. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister why there is such a distinction between sponsors and sponsor governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 67 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to determine who will be initial sponsor governors. It would be useful to know what factors the Secretary of State will take into account when making those regulations. I can think of a number. The financial arrangements to be made between the sponsor and the school may be relevant. Will a one-off payment be sufficient to buy a place on the school governing body? We have heard that support staff places on a governing body are not to be reserved. That is interesting. If people can get themselves together and form a cartel, however, they may be able to buy themselves a place on the governing body as initial sponsor governors that possibility shows the way in which our education system is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are worried about pay-as-you-learn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's flights of fancy. There is nothing new about sponsorship. Many of our oldest schools were sponsored by merchant venturers, City livery companies and so on. Such sponsorship is linked to voluntary aided schools, therefore it is tied up with their rules. The recent form of sponsorship of the city technology colleges is governed by the rules on CTCs. When is the hon. Gentleman referring to? Does he have evidence of abuse—if he is referring to the CTC system? What are his other worries? I assume that he is not suggesting that a governor should not make a generous donation to a school if he wishes. Can he give examples of abuse in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that clause 67 represents a new departure and a new concept.

Private schools such as Eton and Harrow were established to provide education for the needy in their local communities. They have moved a long way from the basis on which they were founded in the 16th century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. As a result of those deeds they received charitable status. I look forward to the very near future when, I hope, we may have educational commissioners who will ensure that those schools meet their obligations. The charity commissioners may feel that they should scrutinise closely the activities of such schools. Before the intervention by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) I was saying that many of us were anxious about pay as you learn; now there appears to be pay as you govern; people can buy themselves a place on a school governing body. To deny a place to support staff but to allocate places to people who can afford them is not the right way forward for the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be dealt with in the regulations referred to in the clause? Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee so that we may know what issues the Government regard as important. What is the Government's intention in introducing the concept of sponsorship to the grant-maintained sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea referred to the CTC initiative, which has collapsed, although there may be the odd exception. Unfortunately I cannot remember the exact figures, but when the concept was introduced, it was proposed to set up 80 CTCs nationally, but only about 20 or 25 have been established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have been slower in coming to fruition than they might have been because of the dog-in-the-manger attitude of some of the Labour local education authorities, not least among them the Inner London education authority, which declined to make available schools in London which could have been used for that purpose and could have brought extra resources to London schools.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the hon. Member for Dewsbury will stop chattering. That was possible only when the powers of the ILEA were devolved to the boroughs. In my LEA area, the second CTC is opening this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can always tell when Conservative Members have no argument because they resurrect ILEA, which was disbanded three years ago, if not earlier. Twelve LEAs were established as a result of the abolition of ILEA. There are about 116 other LEAs in England and Wales where the CTC initiative could have been pursued. The reason it was not is that many organisations and companies resisted it because they recognised that it was not the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend that when the initiative was first introduced, 20 per cent. of funding was to come from the Government and 80 per cent. from the sponsor. However, within a short time, those two figures were reversed. That shows clearly that sponsors did not come forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The Government may want to consider the arrangements that they made with those who said they would act as sponsors. The Government have discharged their part of the contract: they have given knighthoods to those involved and must be waiting for the cash to come in. The private sector, which promised funding for the CTC initiative has been slow to come up with the money. It will be interesting to look at the promises that were made three or four years ago by certain sections of industry to sponsor CTC schools. I wonder how much those organisations have put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to clarify the facts on the record. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) suggested that 80 per cent. of the funding was to have come from business and 20 per cent. from Government. In reality, 100 per cent. of the capital expenditure was to have come from business. The number of CTCs is not as great as he suggested and is only 15 at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to those figures. I was unsure whether the number was up to 25, but I tried to give a conservative estimate, as usual, to ensure that I did not mislead the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 67 is significant because it reveals the direction in which the Government want education to move. I hope that the Minister will deal with three key issues. First, what is the Government's intention regarding sponsorship and, in that context, what items will be covered by the regulations in clause 67? Secondly, why is there a distinction between sponsors and sponsor governors, with sponsor governors requiring approval under clause 67, but no such requirement appearing for other sponsors in clause 58? Thirdly, if this is such a good idea, why is it reserved only for the secondary sector and does not apply to the primary sector? Those questions need to be answered and I hope that the Minister can respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely worried about the concept of sponsorship within education. People seek sponsorship either to promote a name or a product so that they get the benefit of advertising from it; or to gain influence over the organisation that receives the sponsorship. Those two concepts, which are clearly part of the free market economy, do not lend themselves to the state education system, which deserves better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we guard against people seeking sponsorship of a school and becoming named sponsor governors so that they can advertise a particular product? The managing director of Benetton, for example, might wish to sponsor a school. Therefore, the "united colours of Benetton", whose advertising standards have caused the general community much anxiety, would be promoting a particular school.

The managing director of Allied Lyons, who is known for sponsorship in other areas, might decide to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
sponsor a school. Allied Lyons sponsors the Conservative party to gain influence in the nation's political sphere. Would it be right for an individual associated with such a company to sponsor a particular school? That might be done through the famous brewery in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Mr. Hoyle), so we might have the "Tetley Bittermen" school, which would be an interesting concept. Until recently Greenall Whitley brewed beer in my constituency and its famous advertising slogan was, "Another greater bitter ending". Such sponsorship is inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that, for once, the hon. Gentleman would consider the good motives of sponsors. The Skinners' school—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dennis Skinner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the Skinners of the City livery companies. The hon. Gentleman might say that they were advertising their trade and hoping for custom, but that is nonsense. He should go to Croydon and visit the City Technology of the Arts college, which is sponsored by the British music industry and driven forward by the expertise of Lord Birkett, and see the reality of an industry backing good education. Of course, there is a spin-off for the industry: more people are trained in the skills that that industry will need in the future. That is why people are prepared to invest in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One only has to consider the CTCs of which I am aware. Parents queue so that their children can enter them. The parents know that their children will receive a good technical education in addition to the rest of the curriculum. That is the reality of CTCs, not the baser motives that the hon. Gentleman has attributed to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Battersea has made an interesting speech. He may wish to contribute later. It was tempting to intervene on the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea referred to organisations that are prepared to sponsor education. I do not deny that they exist, but the Minister should focus on the potential difficulties that the clause will create for the education system. Many issues are involved. Would we like John Player to sponsor a state school? There is a campaign aimed at reducing the number of people smoking and that has parallels with the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) about safer sex. We are trying to educate people not to smoke and one way of encouraging that would be a complete ban on tobacco advertising. However, a sponsored governor could bring such advertising into a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the 	<i>quid pro quo;</i> people may put money into a school in order to seek influence within it. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
said that that could provide a financial means by which someone could become the member of the governing body of a grant-maintained school. That could bring back old practices in a different guise, such as the twice revised code of 1862 which provided for payment by results. We must consider those grave questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried by the divisive nature of the Bill, but we should also take account of differences between schools in the reasonably prosperous and deprived areas of the country. Sponsorship could also be divisive because there may not be the potential sponsorship for governors for schools in the deprived regions. Even in a given region, some parts are more prosperous than others. That is true in my constituency of Warrington, South. A two-tier system would emerge for grant-maintained schools and that would be dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain how, when a school is sponsored either by a named organisation or sponsored governors, that sponsorship will be recognised? Would it be seen in the school's name, such as the Bridgewater John Player high school? In my constituency, we could have the Norton Tetley Walker Priory high school. That does not quite ring, but that is what sponsorship is about. The premier league is sponsored and the name of the sponsor is heard each time we hear of that league. The same applies to the divisions of the football league. Will the sponsor's name appear on the school's notepaper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that that has already happened in the new university sector? The former Liverpool polytechnic is now called John Moores' university because John Moores has given it a fair amount of financial support. That is the direction in which the Government want to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a useful intervention. It could have been called the "John Moores pick eight from 11 university of Liverpool". But that is a matter for next Monday when we debate the national lottery.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a roman candle which would have to be lit from a distance after unwrapping the blue touch paper.

A discussion of school uniform could take us from the absurd to the ridiculous. Sponsorship is about recognition for the sponsor. It could apply to the national curriculum. English could be sponsored by the noble Lord Archer, maths by Johnson Matthey Bankers, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International or the Treasury. Pick any one. How about geography sponsored by P and O or Virgin Atlantic Airways? History could be sponsored the author of the Hitler diaries, physical education by Frank Tyson or Ladbrokes, health education by the makers of John Player cigarettes and outdoor pursuits by Cadbury Ltd—which advertises milk tray chocolates. Members of the Committee will have to think about that one. Home economics could be sponsored by Tetley Walker, open Government by Richard Nixon and craft, design and technology by B and Q.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the latter comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) were light-hearted, but he has identified a trend in education. The Bill contains nothing to stop what he discussed from happening. That is the serious side of his argument. We must legislate against extremes because if we do not, there is a danger that circumstances will arise in which they may become reality, although they seem light-hearted now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not speak for long, but would like to discuss sponsored governors. We ought not to forget that this will not be the first time that industrialists have served on school governing bodies. In my experience, schools have often co-opted local industrialists to serve on their governing body. The difference is that they did not have to pay a sum of money to secure a governorship. Many such industrialists ran small businesses such as a factory or shop in the school's locality. They did not have a lot of spare money and were never going to make a major financial contribution to the school of which they were governors. They put forward the industrialist's point of view while school governance was being examined and supplied local knowledge. They employed the mothers, fathers, grandparents, brothers and sisters of the pupils and often offered quality work experience or work shadowing their families. I would approve of such industrialists becoming governors. They are an integrated part of the community and have a vested interest in a school's success and its image in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that such people will be squeezed out by the Bill. Schools will be tempted to seek sponsor governors from industries that can offer the most money, hardware or computer software to them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said, it will be a case of buying a place on the governing body. It will be difficult for schools to resist such a temptation. They will have to choose whether to continue their connection with small firms, such as a grocer's or a fish and chip shop, the manager of which may be important as he monitors which children leave school at luchtime by buy fish and chips. That may seem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
lighthearted, but it is crucial. Schools will choose sponsorship from British Telecom, Dunlop, Rover or, in my constituency, Land Rover, because they will bring the most goods with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Lady with interest. Often we have heard Labour Members grumbling and moaning about the lack of support for schools from industry and business, yet the hon. Lady says that schools will be spoilt for choice. She talks of the Land Rovers and Dunlops of this world on the one hand and of the small corner shops on the other. They are not exclusive but complementary. The intimacy of the small corner shop, where the proprietor knows the pupils who go in there to buy their Cadbury's Flake, or whatever it might be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, but I am sure that Cadbury's Flake is excellent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are delighted that companies are coming foward and I am delighted that the hon. Lady at least accepts that British industry is supporting British education. In the past Labour Members have often criticised CTCs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a very long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure which part of the intervention to answer to ensure that what I intended as a short contribution does not take us well beyond lunchtime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth should remember, that we are now discussing governors, not industry's support of schools, which is a completely different matter. I believe that there should be close links between industry and schools, but we are discussing governors. There is a limit of four sponsor governors under the legislation. In making a selection there will be a tendency to make the choice that offers the greatest financial return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members' objections have not been to close links between school and industry. It is fine for visits by industrialists to the classroom to be integrated into the curriculum, for pupils to visit industry to see what happens and to relate what they see to their studies, and for teachers and industrialists to undertake joint work, supervised by the teachers in the classroom. But I object to schools having to rely on industrialists to buy essential equipment for teaching children. That is the second of my concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great inequality of funding will arise from the sponsor governor provisions. Already, when I go to schools in my constituency, I am shown equipment or a building paid for with contributions from industry. That should not be happening, because the other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
school down the road does not have the piece of equipment or building paid for by industry. It is essential to make available to all children in all our schools equipment and buildings necessary for a first-class education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour objections are not to close links between education and industry but to education's financial dependence on industry in any constituency. The Bill invites schools to go further along that road. I worry about the schools that will not be given expensive sponsorship, because they will not receive the equipment that it can bring. How will the Minister compensate schools that do not receive financial sponsorship from large industries in return for seats on their governing bodies? Is he happy that children in such schools will enjoy more limited facilities, less equipment or a poorer building? Surely he is not happy that, through industrial sponsorship of schools, some children have access to better equipment and finer buildings. That cannot be a way to ensure top-quality education for all children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and time again Labour Members have said that Tory education policy concentrates on favouring a few at the expense of the rest through specialist schools and elitist attitudes. This is just another example. Some schools will be better funded because of their relationship with their sponsor governors. Opposition Members do not want such a provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Lady is speaking on behalf of the Labour party—those on the Front Bench have turned their backs—when she says that it is Labour party policy that there should be no donations from industrial or commercial concerns, or from parents, as some parents are better off than others. That is nonsense; it does not affect the funding formula for schools. That practice is applied across the board, it is fair and it is based on the needs of schools. The link between schools, industry and employers has existed for generations through foundations, foundation governors and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was chairman of education I went to great lengths during industry year to twin local firms with local schools. Many compacts were formed to try to extend that concept. The hon. Lady is now saying that that is wrong because somebody somewhere might get something that another school down the road does not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was another long intervention by the hon. Gentleman. Sponsorships might not affect the funding formula for schools, but they certainly affect the funding of schools. I ask the Minister to face that reality and to consider the inequalities that that will produce. Such funding is to be linked to the governorship of the school: to the exercise of power and influence as a governor of the school. That link is new. The hon. Member for Battersea is right that it is not new for industry or individuals to give money to schools. What is new is that such practice is now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>878</span>
linked to a place on the board. We are against that connection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with industrialists having an influence in schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refuse to answer that question again. I have said six times now that there is nothing wrong with school and industry learning from each other and working together to improve the quality of education for our children. Please read the clause, because I do not think that Conservative Members have done so. We are arguing against industry purchasing seats on governing bodies. If Conservative Members believe that the only way for industrialists to have an influence and work jointly in schools is to offer them a place on a governing body, they belittle industry because many industrialists have been doing that for years without such an incentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We object to that connetion: it is a great source of concern. Along with sponsorship of shcools, to which my hon. Friend the Member of Warrington, South referred, that trend should be resisted. The legislation provides no boundaries to prevent the expansion of such sponsorship. My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South made some light-hearted remarks, but we believe that the Bill should define those boundaries. It fails to do that. Instead, it goes a step further and puts places on governing bodies up for sale to the highest bidder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At a previous sitting I quoted with some approval, if not affection, the workds of Clem Attlee. It now occurs to me that Lord Wilson of Rievaulx made a positive contribution when he established the Open university. I do not want to debate that because I am sure that you would object, Sir John, but I must say that I have warm feelings about it. At the time, that organisation was seen as a university for the second chance, although that phrase has now passed out of currency. This morning has shown that the Opposition, having missed the bus by not debating these matters in principle, have had to scratch around to find a platform for their arguments. This clause stand part debate provides such a platform. It is a narrow clause, on which a wider debate is being pegged. However, I make no objection to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting and revealing discussion, which was begun, with characteristic modesty and elegance, by the hon. Member for Wallsend. When he mentioned the role of charity, I recalled that about four years ago I debated the question of charity with my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State for Education at some outlandish hour of the morning in an Adjournment debate just before Christmas. I referred to the judgment of Lord Justice McNaughton in 1601, which still helps to determine the law and practice of charity. I shall not dilate on that, but it has been part of the genius of the British that that flexible attitude to charity has allowed institutions to be set up for a public purpose. As I recall it, the McNaughton
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>879</span>
definition included public works, such as new bridges, that could be carried out by charities. Such works are rarely the result of charitable activity now, but charitable trusts and the practice of charities have evolved over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, we have a well developed charity sector and a powerful voluntary sector. I welcome that. If the hon. Member for Wallsend objects to the work of educational charities, he may have recourse over any breach of trust to the Charity Commission. However, it is characteristic of the Labour party, as some later remarks demonstrated, that Labour Members seem to want educational commissioners—or was it commissars?—to examine such matters further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have no difficulty with the concept of charity, nor with involving those additional resources in public purposes. I suspect that that is evidence of the difference in philosophy of Conservative and Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the Minister's remarks about charities have not been especially relevant. Does he mean that any company that sponsors a school in the way anticipated by the Government will gain some tax advantages from that sponsorship being treated as a charitable donation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with that question in the more detailed analysis that will follow my preliminary remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) were revealing. She seemed to gain the general approval of Opposition Members when she said that a school sponsored by a company would enjoy an unfair advantage over other schools that were not so sponsored. The implication of her argument was that we should prevent one school having such an advantage in order that all schools might share the equality of misery. That is socialism writ large. I am glad it has been exposed in this morning's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not clear that the Government have consistently taken money from one of their pockets to enrich some individual or other—in this case an individual school? They then conclude that all schools are equally rich, and underfund the others. My hon. Friend the Member for Yardley was saying that there should be a mechanism to help schools in poverty stricken areas. In my constituency, it is very unlikely that Grimethorpe colliery will sponsor many schools, but no jobs and no industry will be left there apart from that. How will Hemsworth survive? What sources should we look to? Will the Minister perhaps send down ICI or IBM to sponsor some of our schools? I should be grateful if he did so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

closures—which plainly concern the Committee—into this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mechanism within both the local education authority and the standing spending assessment, or the grant that flows from that, for the recognition of social need. Indeed, LEAs themselves do not make precise equality of provision between the various schools and their levels of funding. They may take those decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the Minister's comments when I was sitting the other side of the barrier. Does the Minister agree that some of the facilities currently provided in schools by local industries are basic items of equipment that should be provided by a properly funded LEA and that, without such facilities schools are unable to provide the quality of education that all children are entitled to expect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the SSA is to assess the needs and the appropriate level of spending and to resource it accordingly. The hon. Lady's argument has been used down the ages by socialists. I am glad that she redeployed it in Committee. Her argument is that anything that comes from outside is suspect because it upsets the balance—the equality of misery—that she proposes. When she says that if something comes from outside it means that there is insufficient funding from the centre, she immediately reveals where her argument takes her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this little debate, the Minister has twice used the phrase "the equality of misery". Does that mean that he believes that the only escape from the miserable basic funding provided through SSAs is, for those schools lucky enough to receive it, industrial sponsorship?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, what I am saying is this: it seems clear that Opposition Members want the pursuit of equality and so are prepared to settle for misery—which is exactly the level of resourcing of their educational service that they delivered as a result of their economic failures and their record, which led them to lose four successive elections—and they do not care whether it is good for the school, as long as it is no worse or no better than for anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been talk of equality of misery, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend mentioned. Does the Minister agree that there should be a basic level of provision, based on equality of provision within education systems? If so, can he explain why Lancashire would receive £39 million more if its SSA calculations were made on the same basis as those for Kent? Is not that inequality written into statute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been fairly tolerant in this debate. However, the clause relates to governors and members of the Committee should perhaps concentrate on that rather than on the wider issues raised on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your comments, Sir John. It is always open to Opposition Members and indeed to Government Members to make representations about how the SSA is calculated. I hope that they will do so. I know of no system that sets out to be fair that can depart from the principle of having a formula on which the funding is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point, which is perhaps more germane to our line of argument, relates to the philosophy that perhaps we should not take on sponsorship because it might somehow destabilise the system or lead to one school being better than another. That would shape the basis for the existing funding and support for our education system. It is proper to say that the Churches, which have a tremendous tradition and have set up many schools that some members of the Committee must have attended, are involved in education and still, to some extent, finance it. They are sponsors and I do not imagine that any hon. Member wants them to withdraw from that role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is surely being misleading about Church sponsorship, which mainly provides the 15 per cent. that the Government specify is necessary for voluntary-aided schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In recognition of that role, the Churches receive rights to nominate governors. I throw out that point because it is 	<i>ad absurdum.</i> No hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Brewers' Foundation in my constituency is another example of the ancient foundations to which my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I congratulated good practice in sponsorship and was not derogatory. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I did not mention a brewery in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister risks misleading himself. He said that no hon. Member would oppose the Church funding of schools. Let me remind him of the phrase in "A Socialist Policy for Education":

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's example of Church-aided schools, in contrast to business sponsorship. My experience of Roman Catholic schools is that the fact that the Church acts, in effect, as a sponsor permeates every facet of the school and determines its ethos in every area of its activity. Is the Minister suggesting that private sponsorship would have the same effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for the governing body. As the hon. Gentleman will remember, the governors retain the majority. I shall consider in a moment how that might work in practice. We have had a long preliminary bout on the principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a little about how we envisage the sponsor governors working. Unrepentently, we do not believe in looking a gift horse in the mouth. If there is an opportunity for a school to gain additional resources, it is right to secure them if that is what the governors wish. That can benefit the school and its pupils. It is a positive way of forging closer links between business and schools. There are several such positive links in my constituency, although none has yet developed in the way proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall resist any caricature of the proposal by Opposition Members or anyone else, which suggests that it is a simple, commercial relationship that is not accountable, with no controls or sanctions. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>883</span>
necessary to safeguard the proposal and to ensure that it works positively, as does the relationship with the Churches or with the traditional, charitable bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relates to the nomination of the sponsor and the appointment of governors, and it is narrowly drawn. The tradition of sponsorship goes much further back into the mists of time. The clause is about how it will be regulated and operated. It might be helpful to the Committee if I remind hon. Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the concept of sponsorship in education goes back into the mists of time. I accept that the concept of donations to education goes back into the mists of time, but those donations have not necessarily been recognised in the same form as sponsorship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be allowed to make my case about how the proposal may or may not work. I remember the hon. Gentleman's remark that there is no part for the market economy to play. He would argue that sponsors will wish to buy their way into a particular pattern of school provision. I reject that argument because it is inappropriate. What the hon. Gentleman fears will not happen for reasons that I shall explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an essential and basic safeguard: we are discussing adding sponsors and sponsor governors to the governing body. It is for the governing body of the school to determine whether it wishes to initiate the procedure for sponsorship. There must be an element of partnership from the start. It is not a matter of a rich man or a powerful and influential business trying to win further influence by writing a cheque or seeing someone to "fix it" behind the governors' backs. There must be a mutual agreement that what is proposed would be beneficial, as I believe that it would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first stage of the process is the governors' acceptance, then there is the Secretary of State's acceptance of their proposals. I take issue with the hon. Member for Wallsend. He blurred the distinction between the proposal and the appointment of a sponsor and the appointment of sponsor governors as set out in the clause. The proposal has to be agreed between the governors and the sponsor and is then submitted to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may want to examine several criteria. If he does not give his consent, the proposal falls and provisions for the appointment of sponsor governors falls with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a clear relationship between clauses 67 and 58. Subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of clause 58 distinguish between naming a sponsor and providing for the sponsor to serve on the governing body. A sponsor may decide not to accept a position on the governing body. The Secretary of State has no power to object to that. It is only when a sponsor wishes to serve on the governing body that the Secretary of State becomes involved under clause 67.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two hurdles to overcome. First the sponsorship proposal should be approved by the governing body and the Secretary of State on the basis of considerations that I shall outline shortly. The second hurdle is what happens to sponsor governors under clause 67 and the regulations for which the clause paves the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will wish to take a view of the benefit that a school will gain from sponsorship. When the Secretary of State receives a proposal, the governing body will have already approved it. As a safeguard, the proposal must be considered by the Secretary of State. There is no tariff for buying seats on the governing body. There is no automatic right to four seats. It is open to the Secretary of State to withhold approval unless and until agreement has been reached on appropriate sponsorship representation. That is not the same as imposing a solution. The Secretary of State may decide, in the case of a more peripheral involvement by a sponsor, that the full number of sponsor governors is not required. For example, if secondment to a school from a firm on a regular, rotating basis is agreed, the Secretary of State may decide that it is sensible for a representative of the firm to be a governor but that a full slate of four sponsor governors is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must examine the proposals that the school presents and consider what constitutes an appropriate number of sponsor governors. The proposal may not be for four governors. In no case will a governing body fail to have a majority of first governors. The clause does not remove that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State accepts a sponsor and sponsor governors, who may, if nominated, be included in the proposal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a crucial point. Under clause 67, it is not within the Secretary of State's power to approve the sponsor. He can approve sponsor governors. A company might wish to support a specific school, but not to accept a place on the governing body. Clause 58 provides for two different sorts of sponsor: a school sponsor and a sponsor governor. If the Secretary of State can approve a sponsor governor, why cannot he approve a sponsor? Under clause 67, there is no such power. I hope that the Minsiter will explain why sponsors are not included in the approval procedure, whereas sponsor governors are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman on the basis of the advice that I have received. I was anxious to establish the time profile. The two tests are: is the sponsorship proposal acceptable, and are the governors properly appointed under the regulations? They are separate processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's approval of a proposal is, in a way, a seamless robe. It will include the name of a sponsor, a series of conditions or proposals about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>885</span>
what that sponsor, or his or her company, might be doing and the names of governors who it is anticipated will be in place as the sponsor governors. The Secretary of State will look at that ensemble and decide whether the proposal is acceptable and properly conceived. After that, we move to the implementing provisions of the clause in the regulations. I am satisfied that the Secretary of State can consider all those matters in reaching his conclusions, but the hon. Gentleman may wish to reflect on that and write to me later if he still holds a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acceptance of a sponsor and the sponsor governors, which is part of what I described as a package, depends on the Secretary of State being convinced that the school is to derive real benefits from the sponsorship proposal. There is a test of benefit and the Secretary of State would have to satisfy himself about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments. There is some confusion in my mind because of the way in which the clause is drafted and, after some reflection, the Minister's words may prove to be useful. If, in the correspondence that I hope will take place, there is a gap in the Secretary of State's powers to approve a sponsor as opposed to initial sponsor governors, will the Minister consider tabling amendments to plug it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are satisfied that there is no such gap but, of course, I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point about correspondence and, if necessary, we shall return to the issue later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I owe to the Committee a reference to the benefits test, or examples of what the Secretary of State may wish to consider in approving or otherwise a proposal for sponsorship. One could be the capital sum to be put forward; another, to which I have already adverted, is secondment; and another could be training opportunities and work placements with the sponsor. Along the lines of arrangements that may already have been concluded informally, there are several possibilities for interesting and beneficial packages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general principle, I emphasise to the Committee that, apart from the Secretary of State having to consider the interests and having the ability to accept, reject or obtain amendments to proposals on an agreed basis, the sponsors must go through the intitial hurdle of the governors, who are, in a sense, in the driving seat. It is only with mutual agreement that the proposals may go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also owe the Committee a measure of definition of the regulations as set out in the clause. They are essentially technical and mirror the provisions in clauses 63 and 65. The regulations make provision for the determination of those who are to be initial sponsor governors. That is comparable to clause 63, on the determination of initial first or foundation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
governors. The regulations would typically include provision for the sponsor to appoint the governors, and the governors should, as far as possible, be named in the proposals on their publication. There are reasons why that may not always be possible, but, clearly, it is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also make provision for the replacement of initial sponsor governors when the governor proposed has either died or resigned. That relates closely to the arguments deployed about clause 65. The regulations are essentially technical and implementing proposals based on the general principle, which Conservative Members strongly endorse, that we should provide for voluntary acceptance, by agreement, of sponsors subject to the safeguards that I outlined and the approval of the Secretary of State. We believe that the proposals have the potential to bring in valuable extra resources, in cash or in kind, to improve the high standards in education that already exist. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 564 relates to the appointing of governors who are committed not only to the good governance and continuing viability of the school but to the spiritual, moral, mental and physical development of the community that it serves. It is important for governors to be aware of the wider community implications of their activities. I am aware that there are fundamental differences between Labour and Conservative philosophy on that subject. I do not expect the Conservative Front Bench to agree to the amendments, but we must use this opportunity to educate Conservative Members—if they are listening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Education Act 1944, LEAs have encouraged schools to provide an education that gives opportunity to and develops potential in every child and to expect the highest standards from pupils. We must stress that education is a widening process: children can learn from the wider community and the wider community can learn using the available resources in schools. For the benefit of the community, skills must be developed, children stimulated to learn and parents encouraged to participate. Responsibility for and participation in the community should be encouraged in schools. I do not think that anyone would disagree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Henry Morris, the famous chief education officer of Cambridgeshire, was inspired to create the community college system of which we are so proud. He believed that the role of the state was to provide the resources and facilities that local men and women, through a democratic system, would shape, for particular educational needs. I shall quote Henry Morris, because he makes my point very ably. In "Institutionalism and Freedom in Education", he states:
	<br><q><p>'It should be the first duty of education to concern itself with the ultimate goals of education as they exist for the manhood and womanhood of the community; that the activity we call education should mean the attempt, critical and constructive, to increase the sum and enhance the quality of good life; that this activity should not only concern man as an economic and political animal, but should be the means whereby the life of the community is conserved and consecrated, and the individual's sense of the significance and destiny of human life kept alive and intact. Man's life as an economic, social and religious animal—that is the subject-matter of education, and education the means whereby he achieves the best in all these respects."</p></q>
That is a visionary view of learning and citizenship. Had the Government taken into account such quotations by Henry Morris when they began to write the White Paper and the Bill, they would have inspired confidence, hope and support. Instead, the proposals will fragment and disintegrate community support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
An ordinary citizen will play no part in education unless he or she is a parent governor or a parent of a child at the school. Ordinary people will feel no sense of belonging to the school community. Parents will have more information: they will have greater choice—perhaps—and a determining role if they have a child at a particular school. However, there will be no role for parents whose children have left and no role for anyone not involved with the governors. The amendment widens the remit of school governors so that they are concerned not only with the welfare of individual schools, but with the school's involvement in the community and vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to engender a sense of ownership and to take pride in the local school's achievements, because it is a local school serving the local community. Pupils should feel that their behaviour and social attitude outside school is as important as it is inside school because they are part of the community. The Bill presents a narrow view of education. Some of the Conservative Members—including, perhaps, the Minister—who have attended a public school will not have experienced such an ethos that comes with being part of a local community, in which one's neighbours and friends live. It is not easy for them to understand the concept. That is why I wish to spend some time considering the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote a leader from 	<i>The Times</i> of 21 March 1991, although it is not a paper that I read often. It said:
	<br><q><p>"A community's schools are the quintessential local institutions, symbols of communal strength and accord. They are locally financed, governed and administered in democracies around the world.
