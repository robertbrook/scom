PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE OF CHARACTER ETC.<br><br> BY GOVERNING BODY</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 585, in page 50, line 3, leave out 'subsection (2)' and insert 'subsections (2) and (2A)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 588, in page 50, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) No proposals shall be published under this section for the purpose of making a change in the character of the school of the kind mentioned in section 92(1) of this Act within three years of the date of incorporation of the governing body of the school under this Part of this Act unless—
<ol>
<li>the local education authority for that area, and</li>
<li>the funding authority</li></ol>
have given their consent in writing to the change in question.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 589, in page 50, line 19, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) The publication of a proposal under this section which would change the admission arrangements of the school shall require the consent of the local education authority, unless the authority is subject to an order under (7)(1)(b).'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments and clauses that we shall discuss today are very important. The purpose of amendment No. 585 is to explore the Minister's thinking about whether it is appropriate for schools to have a change of character at the time they become grant-maintained or very shortly afterwards. I hope that the Minister acknowledges that some answers are required.<br><br>
The amendment would introduce a requirement that if a school were to seek a change of status within three years of becoming grant maintained, it should obtain the approval of the local education authority and the funding authority before the change could go ahead. That is a reasonable request, so I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.<br><br>
On Tuesday evening the Minister told us that he did not want turmoil in schools: he did not want them to flip-flop from one type of organisation to another. The changes associated with grant-maintained status are of great significance. The White Paper suggests that grant-maintained schools should have a change of status only in very special circumstances. The Minister said that when parents vote in a ballot on opt-out, they should concentrate on the main issue: the appropriateness of grant-maintained status. Therefore, it is essential that we ensure that any decision to opt for grant-maintained status is followed by a period of stability.<br><br>
The amendment covers the two most significant changes that grant-maintained schools might consider.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
The first is the size of the school and the admission numbers. That is significant at a time when there are surplus places in many areas. It is appropriate for the local authority to be involved. Decisions should not be taken in isolation; they must be part of the planning provision for the area. I hope that the Minister will accept that there should be no change in the size of a grant-maintained school without local authority involvement in the context of a decision on surplus places in the area. Ministers and local authorities have recognised the problem. To allow grant-maintained schools to apply in isolation for extra places could be costly and waste public funds if there are places in another area.<br><br>
The amendment takes account of the change of character in a school. For example, some schools become grant maintained and later become selective. I hope that the Minister will accept our arguments, despite his earlier comments about the dead hand of comprehensivisation, the statements by his right hon. Friend Baroness Blatch about specialisation and the pressure on Ministers to accept further specialisation. Anyone who doubts that specialisation is a code word for selection should consider the words of Conservative Back Benchers as well as Ministers. It is clear that when Conservative Members speak about specialisation, they mean preparation for reintroducing selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolute rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Conservative Members are more forthright than others in admitting that. It is a serious issue that causes problems.<br><br>
I hesitate to mention yet again the school in my constituency that opted out—Castle Hall. Dewsbury has experienced most education problems. Castle Hall was a middle school and part of a reorganisation that was proceeding with the consent of parents, teachers and governors in the area. The reorganisation was intended, partly, to deal with surplus places. Castle Hall did not like the proposal to end middle school provision in that part of Kirklees. It fought a campaign to become grant maintained and used, "Save our middle school" as a slogan. The campaign was headed by those who believed in such schools. The school persuaded parents to vote for grant-maintained status and convinced the Secretary of State that it should remain open as a middle school in a reorganised structure that did not include middle schools. Within a year of that campaign, Castle Hall decided to become a selective secondary school.<br><br>
Our amendment would permit a school to apply to become a selective school or to change the age range for which it catered. However, the application would have to be approved by the LEA as well as the funding authority. Under such a provision, the campaign fought by Castle Hall at the time of opting out could have been more honest, because there was an unwritten agenda. If there are to be fundamental changes, we should know precisely what is intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two quick points, the first being about Castle Hall. The fact that its proposal was refused refutes allegations from Opposition Members that the Secretary of State will approve any proposal in order to increase the number of grant-maintained schools. Castle Hall is a positive example that that is not so.<br><br>
My second point is more serious. I do not understand what is wrong with specialisation but, then unlike the hon.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
Lady, I have long experience of it in my constituency and we call those grammar schools. I have had positive experience since five of my six sons were educated at one of those grammar schools and I know the system works. I am unashamed of my views: I support the concept of specialised schools because I know from personal experience that they function well. It would be nice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is quite long enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Sir John, why you had to curtail the intervention by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey). I hope that he will catch your eye later and make a speech expanding on his views. He is blatant in his support for selection—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unashamedly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unashamedly so, to use his words. I wish that other Conservative Members were equally honest in their intent. The hon. Gentleman, who occasionally stands in for the Secretary of State on television programmes—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend does it very well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Lady has read the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today, which discusses the Secretary of State's frequent absences. I am sure that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will continue to stand in for his right hon. Friend whenever necessary. I wish that other Conservative Members were as honest about their intentions as the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth referred to the fact that Castle Hall's application for grant-maintained status was refused. I quoted at previous sittings what was said by a Conservative councillor in my constituency about the intention of this Secretary of State. The right hon. Gentleman's predecessor heard the representations about Castle Hall. It will be an interesting test case if this Secretary of State is willing to turn down proposals to opt out. An even earlier predecessor of the Secretary of State allowed Castle Hall to opt out to avoid closure, which is what the present incumbent of that office says he will not allow in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never said that the grammar school system is the only way to achieve excellence, although it is one way. I chaired the education committee of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, which has a grammar school system. The other schools in the borough also obtain excellent results, although at a slower pace and some of their pupils go on to higher education. I have never understood the Labour party's desire to destroy excellence. When the Liberal party briefly held power in the borough—the Labour party was in alliance with it—and announced that it would abolish the grammar schools, the people of Kingston turned out the Liberals in by-election after by-election and put the Conservatives back in office. The people, not the politicians, of that borough opted for a grammar school system. The other schools in the borough were excellent, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether we shall go along the Conservative Back Bench, getting personal statements from hon. Members for the sake of clarification, although we appreciate that they are taking an interest in the debate this morning.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
10.45 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said that he supports grammar and comprehensive schools. I wonder when a Conservative Member will start a campaign which runs, "Save our secondary moderns" or "Bring back our secondary moderns" because if some of them want to promote selection to grammar schools, a second tier system must exist. Something that is not as good must be in that second division. By definition, elitism cannot exist unless the majority are condemned to a second-rate system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, but there is plenty of time for Conservative Members to make yet more personal statements. Parents in all parts of the country, including those in Solihull, have resisted any attempt to return to a selective system. In certain cases, schools want to become grant-maintained because they do not like the fact that they are part of a selective system. I shall give way to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), if he wants to tell us his view on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give the Committee a personal statement, but I want to react to the kind of ideological claptrap about which the hon. Lady speaks. She says that as soon as a system of selection is established, there will, automatically, be a second-class system for other pupils. That is the biggest nonsense I have ever heard in my life.<br><br>
Good education is education that is appropriate for the skills, aptitudes and abilities of a particular child. If I had a non-academic child, I would far prefer that he were taken on by a school on that basis, rather than if he were sent to a school, in which he was automatically assumed to have academic potential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would hate to label and define my child, at any age, as non-academic or academic and to set his future education according to one label given at one particular time. Such a label may be given when the child is 11, under the old 11-plus, or when he goes to junior school, which the Government seem to favour. Following Monday's statement about primary education, the Government seem to want to promote specialisation in junior schools, with, I suspect, a view to prepare for selection at 11, and for a divisive system of education after that age. I think that the Government are moving in that direction. Ministers are unsure whether to promote that openly, but Back Benchers, such as the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, are telling us the real essence of the Conservative party policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I invite the hon. Member, who cannot be other than an hon. Lady, if she will tell us if she is against all assessments of a child's needs—that is what she implies by saying that she is against all labels. It is not a question of labelling; it is a question of assessing the best education for a child. Does not the hon. Lady accept, as most educationists do, that, for some children, faster learning opportunities are important and that equally, the slower learner can achieve just as much in the long run? That is the way in which the non-grammar schools in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
Kingston scored: they got their pupils to university, including Oxford and Cambridge, but at a slower pace than that of a grammar school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more Conservative Members try to explain themselves, the clearer it is that they are in favour of labelling. Of course there should be assessment of children, but it should be meaningful and continuous, not a simple testing procedure that is supposed to reveal everything about a child for ever. The hon. Gentleman let the cat out of the bag when he spoke about a slow learner. A person upon whom that definition is thrust will carry for ever a label that is fixed and offers no flexibility. That was the problem with the old 11-plus system.<br><br>
We object to institutionalised assessment, under which one assessment can result in a label that will determine a person's future educational opportunities. That is what is so wrong with the type of device described by some Conservative Members.<br><br>
The period of three years set out in the amendment may not be long enough, but it is a starting point for discussion about the degree of stability that is required. Ministers who spoke the other night about their fear of a flip-flop in that regard should take that point seriously. In their haste to promote certain types of education, politicians often cause much damage. In Bolton in 1979—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has gone to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth for instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, if he has done that, I shall speak more slowly.<br><br>
The Minister should be aware of the damage that the Conservative party has caused to education over the years. Very often, that damage has been caused by hasty decisions. In Bolton in 1979, there was a plan to make education comprehensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary of State for Schools is interested in this story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a real horror story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education is right: I hope that he will say as much again when he has heard the details.<br><br>
There was a change of Government in 1979. In January, the children in Bolton had been told which comprehensive school they were to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So much for choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were properly prepared. Their parents had visited the schools and spoken to people about the transition to the new system that was due to begin in September 1979. Then in May the Conservative party won the general election. In June, the Conservative Government decided that Bolton would not go comprehensive that September after all. School allocations were cancelled; children were made to sit an 11-plus examination and left primary school that July not knowing which secondary school they would attend in September.<br><br>
That confusion resulted from Tory councillors and Ministers chopping and changing—flip-flopping—on education, to the detriment of the children in Bolton. There was more flip-flopping later.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another element to the educational history of children in Bolton. The hon. Member for Battersea said, "So much for choice", but I wonder whether he recalls what happened in 1981, when the Tory-controlled local authority, which cancelled the earlier education reforms, was kicked out of office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parents of Bolton, who were rightly outraged at that experiment and at the uncertainty about their children's education, took their revenge on the Conservative local authority. The new Labour authority brought forward even better plans for comprehensivisation in Bolton and we were able to convince a Conservative Secretary of State of the wisdom of those plans. So, comprehensive education came to Bolton, but at what cost to those children whose education was disrupted while various Conservatives vied with each other over who would determine policy. That is one reason that, wherever possible, the provision of education should be stable and care should be taken over potentially disruptive decisions, such as those that could come about if our amendment were rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is now after stability, but only as recently as our last meeting she was bitterly opposed to a grant-maintained school staying in that sector: she wanted an in-out, in-out, flip-flop system. It is her criticism of instability, rather than mine, that goes against her stance last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to say that we should adjust the amendment that we tabled a few nights ago so that decisions could be made only after three years of grant-maintained experience, I should be prepared to consider that. The idea that parents should have three years' experience of a school before deciding to ballot on whether to opt in is worth considering. We shall consider that option at a later stage in the debate on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion of the hon. Member for Battersea is constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend agrees. I should appreciate further comments from the hon. Member for Battersea.<br><br>
The basic issue remains. In view of the comments of Conservative Back-Bench Members, it is appropriate for the Minister to clarify the Government's agenda. Do they intend to promote selection? Will they press grant-maintained schools in that direction? Is the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth the true voice of the Conservative party on this issue? I look forward to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak in this debate, but the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) has provoked me incidentally. I could not help noticing that she is carefully studying a brief from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. My hon. Friends will share my view that Opposition Members cannot say anything unless they are advised, and have their strings pulled by their paymasters, the trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is almost as much a pleasure to give way to the hon. Gentleman as it is to give way to the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fancies my hon. Friend as much as he fancies me.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0643">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 971</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether my hon. Friend is right about that, although let me put it on record that I have always had serious doubts about the hon. Gentleman's predilections. By that I mean that anyone who can confuse the non-selective and selective systems to the extent that he is prepared to justify the grammar school system—I have heard this over the years—but fails to justify the secondary modern system would seem to know little about the meaning of choice.<br><br>
My views on selection are not dictated by a union; they come from close local experience. The borough of Trafford, which is a significant part of my constituency, still has selective education. That system comprehensively and consistently fails the overwhelming majority of children. The hon. Gentleman must place on record his view of the secondary modern system. He should justify a system that is designed to ensure that many people are cast aside because of educational selection.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remark that his views are not dictated by a trade union. We may infer from that that the views of other Labour Members are then dictated by trade unions. With respect, the hon. Gentleman's intervention was not up to his usual standard. But I shall take on board his point and shall deal with it in my own cheerful and inimitable fashion.<br><br>
I came into politics to retain choice. I fought a county council by-election in Warwickshire on that platform and part of that choice was the grammar schools. I won that by-election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. Hang on a minute. The hon. Gentleman should contain himself. He is acting like a disruptive pupil. I wonder whether I should treat him as such?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Kick him outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, he is bigger than me.<br><br>
The system in Rugby includes grammar schools, denominational schools, bilateral schools and high schools. Now the hon. Member for Dewsbury said that labels stick. That is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am just warming up. I am beginning to enjoy myself, as one of my right hon. Friends said some years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. When Mr. Martin was in the Chair, he said that it was a tradition in Standing Committees for hon. Members to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was sound advice, but we should allow the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to make a little more progress before he gives way. However, I hope that he will give way during his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dewsbury said that labels stick, but she is wrong. Labels do not stick. In my constituency young people can transfer at age 16 from the high school to a grammar school or to the East Warwickshire college of further education. We have a safety net for pupils that operates well.<br><br>
I strongly resent the slur on some schools, children and teachers in my constituency when Labour Members imply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 972</span>
that they are second-raters. There are no second-raters in the Rugby and Kenilworth constituency and I refute the Opposition's allegation. It is an unfair slur on a system that works and I speak with knowledge of that system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not give way before when he said that he was in favour of choice. What choice of school do children who fail the 11-plus have?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that this is a debating point. The hon. Gentleman knows so little about my constituency that he thinks that the age of transfer is 11. In fact, the age of transfer is 12. That is only a minor point. The principle remains the same. I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest. I would rather have one of my sons attend one of our excellent high schools with the benefit of their excellent teaching and have the chance, if he develops late—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What choice is there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The choice as I said earlier is to move at age 16 to a grammar school, or a bilateral school, or to the East Warwickshire college of further education. That choice is exercised by hundreds of my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could bring himself to mention the amendment from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall mention amendment No. 585, which is of some interest to the Committee. It relates to specialisation, of which I am an unashamed supporter. I believe in specialisation and choice and the two can go hand in hand.<br><br>
I won the seat of Rugby and Kenilworth from a Labour Member in 1979. Since then, the number of votes cast for me at each general election has risen because the central plank of my election address is the maintenance of choice and of Rugby's grammar schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks a great deal about choice and tells us that he won his seat because he campaigned on that issue. Let us suppose that the hon. Gentleman was a Welsh Member of Parliament and a comprehensive school in his constituency decided to opt out, become grant-maintained and then to become a grammar school. What choice would there be for the parents of children who failed the 11-plus?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely unlikely that I shall become a Welsh Member of Parliament. The electorate of Rugby and Kenilworth ensure that, in election after election, I remain their Member of Parliament because, like me, they support choice and diversity in education—a choice ranging from grammar schools to high schools to bilateral schools and denominational schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North):</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> In his enthusiasm for choice and diversity, does the hon. Gentleman recognise the validity of what I said at our previous sitting—that it is necessary to enable schools that offer different curricula to be provided with state funding? That would enable pupils to enjoy a real choice that guarantees them a quality education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is going wide enough without the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth responding to that intervention. When I ask him to refer to the amendment, it is not enough for him merely to refer to its number.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment which relates to the character of schools. I was trying to show their diverse character. Choice should include specialist schools such as grammar schools, technology schools and music schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman since I have a son called Gregory who is almost his age.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He said that his majority had increased at every general election—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not my majority but the number of votes cast for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I attribute that to the declining educational standards in Rugby and Kenilworth.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman harps on about choice in education, but he has not yet answered the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall). He wanted to know how many parents would choose to send their children to secondary modern schools. I fear that the answer is none and there can be no grammar schools without secondary moderns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Were my constituents to hear this debate, they would be extremely angry with the hon. Gentleman when he refers to a decline in educational standards in my constituency. Again, the hon. Gentleman speaks without knowledge. Educational standards in my constituency improve every year.<br><br>
One has only to examine the excellent tables that my right hon. and hon. Friends produce to see the progress that schools make. I welcome tables because they support my view that diversity and choice enhance the quality of education.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked who would choose a school that was not a grammar or a bilateral school. Many parents opt for other schools. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest said, parents acknowledge that not all children will benefit from the specialist atmosphere of a grammar school. Some choose the wider, more gentle progress of a high school. Two of my sons attended such schools. Anyone who says to my face that my children are failures had better be a good runner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Lady whom I like very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for ending my political career. The hon. Gentleman spoke at length about his constituency. I remind him that his constituency is Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is patient, he will perhaps understand my point. The so-called choice that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth mentioned exists in Rugby. However, the intake of secondary school children in Kenilworth is fully comprehensive. When A-level results were published last summer, a comprehensive school in Kenilworth was the only state school in Warwickshire to appear among the top 100 schools. Does the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
Gentleman suggest that standards of education and attainment in Kenilworth are lower than those in Rugby? If so, why has he not campaigned to improve standards in Kenilworth? Is he calling for selection in Kenilworth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for reminding me of the quality of Kenilworth school. It gives the lie to the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope). The hon. Lady is as on the ball just as much as any other member of the Committee. She makes my point. The hon. Lady asks whether I promote selection in Kenilworth. She forgets the existence of grant-maintained schools. Kenilworth school may yet become grant maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not happened yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is early days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that Kenilworth school has succeeded excellently under LEA control? Why should that school apply for grant-maintained status? Standards of education in Kenilworth are exceptionally high. The hon. Gentleman does children in Kenilworth no honour by praising only children in Rugby who attend selective schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should understand that it is difficult to praise grammar schools in Kenilworth when, as she points out, they do not exist. I accept that Kenilworth school is splendid. As I said earlier, that gives the lie to the hon. Member for Hyndburn who complained about standards in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This has gone far enough. We cannot hold a debate about Rugby and Kenilworth. We must debate the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have helped to move the debate in the right direction. We have moved the debate gently towards specialisation and showed that some Conservative Members are not ashamed of our educational system. We are proud of what this and previous Conservative Governments have done to improve the quality and standard of state education. We look forward to the speedy passage of this clause, but I apologise to the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) for not giving way.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been deeply hurt at the discrimination that I have suffered. I sit in sorrow. However, my anguish is all the greater because the hon. Gentleman has strayed from the subject far too often. I was hoping to tackle him on the meat of the amendment, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury has explained, is so important. I shall not do so now, as the hon. Gentleman is clearly weary of his meanderings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to speak in this debate, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has demonstrated, the amendment illustrates the fundamental divide between the educational philosophies of the Government and the Opposition. Those differences should be emphasised, not ignored. Amendment No. 585 would make fundamental changes to the Bill. Conservative Members want schools, through local decision making by governors and parents, to have the maximum opportunity to provide the education that is appropriate for their pupils. In contrast, the Opposition would place all children in a certain type of school, irrespective of local needs, of pupils' abilities and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
aptitudes, and of parents' wishes. That runs counter to what most people consider to be effective provision of education.<br><br>
As I said earlier, specialised schools do not mean elitism. They do not stream children for all time. They provide education that is appropriate for a particular child. I reiterate that, if my child, who is only six, turns out not to be academic, I should prefer him to attend a school that is most appropriate to his abilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about his child, who is only six and whose abilities cannot be predicted. What does he think about specialisation, selection and streaming in junior schools, which his six-year-old child will soon encounter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So long as a child is in the form, class, set or group that is appropriate for his or her abilities in a subject or group of subjects, that child's educational needs will be covered in the best possible way. That is why so many people in my constituency regret that the King Charles I school is no longer a grammar school. That change meant that their parental choice was diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman say whether choice or selection determined who attended that school when it was a grammar school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that selection meant that that school admitted pupils of a certain academic ability increased parental choice, because another school provided comprehensive education.<br><br>
One of the reasons that city technology colleges and the American magnet schools have become so popular, reduce truancy and increase pupil and parental involvment is that they provide the appropriate education for the abilities and aptitudes of the children that they seek to educate.<br><br>
In Her Majesty's inspectorate reports on schools some criticisms are common; one of the most is that the expectations of teachers are not appropriate for the pupils that they teach. Often the expectations are not high enough. One of the reasons given to explain that is that the spread of ability in a class is so wide that it becomes difficult for teachers to orient education towards the aptitudes of pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For many years, I was a teacher in a comprehensive school and, before that, I taught in an excellent secondary modern for 18 years. I remind the hon. Gentleman that varying provisions can be made for different levels of aptitude. That is commonly done in comprehensive schools by setting and streaming. That is a perfectly sensible approach and it provides the same type of choice that the hon. Gentleman claims exists between grammar and comprehensive schools. In addition, parents and pupils sometimes decide to choose a particular set. That offers flexibility because setting is carried out according to subjects. Pupils who are academically good in one subject, but weaker in another can find their level within the flexible system that comprehensive schools offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has now accepted the principle that the education provided should be appropriate to the needs of the child. That can be done in the context of a class, but if parents or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 976</span>
governors want it, one should not deny, on ideological grounds, a school the opportunity to specialise in the type of education that is most appropriate to its pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In so far as there is merit in the concept of setting and streaming to allow an individuals pupil to find his or her level in different subjects, it is that it is possible to reset and restream. Pupils make faster or slower progress. In the divide between secondary modern and grammar schools, it is difficult for pupils to cross the boundary. Once a child has been set, he or she is set for ever. That is the fundamental problem with the secondary modern system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, but it is not an argument against specialist schools. It is an argument against schools that are so specialist that they do not allow transfer between different types of schools.<br><br>
I support specialist schools that are based on the ability and aptitude of children so long as they have flexible means of allowing children to transfer depending on their educational progress. That is what the grant-maintained Old Swinsford hospital school near my constituency offers. If that happens, the Labour party cannot argue against specialist schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, in a school that selects, it is possible that only a small percentage of children would be accepted into it? The vast majority would not be chosen, but many of those children would be capable of gaining academic qualifications and of going on to higher things. If children are labelled at the age of 11 or 12, as in Rugby, they are denied the opportunity to move on to further and higher education and to gain academic qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can offer the hon. Gentleman the example of Birmingham city council, which has five or six grammar schools. Six times as many children apply to those schools as there are places for them. The parents of the five out of six who do not go to those grammar schools do not take the view that just because their children cannot take advantage of that kind of education—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my sentence—that such education should be denied to everyone. Those parents realise that for a system of education to work appropriately there must be choices and that to make such choices effective, different kinds of education must be available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that only one in six get in to those schools, are we to assume that five in six parents do not get their choice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was listening to my last sentence, but that is precisely—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does mean that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does, but that does not vitiate the support of parents for a system of selection in certain schools in Birmingham. They support selection because they realise that any system of education that is truly responsive should provide the greatest possible choice. If councils were more enlightened, the ability of people in Birmingham and elsewhere to set up specialist schools on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 977</span>
the basis of selection, for example, in response to demand, might be increased. There would thus be more choice in the education system, and it would meet the demands of a greater number of parents.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hyndburn has left the Room, but he asked about those who do not get in to specialist or selective schools. He suggested that they are condemned to a second-class education and asked who would want to send their children to a secondary modern school. My argument is that as long as a school is appropriate to the ability of a particular child, parents will want to send their child to that school. For example, Baverstock school in Birmingham, has been grant maintained for the past two years. The head teacher says that because the school has become grant maintained, greater numbers of pupils want to go to it. The school has therefore changed its character and is now oriented towards lower ability pupils. The education results of those pupils are better than before. It is known in the area that that school now has more lower ability pupils and it has become more of a community school.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hyndburn argued that such schools would become less not more popular, but in fact the opposite is the case. That shows me that parents are prepared to send their children to schools as long as they know that those schools are providing an education appropriate to the aptitude of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why, in the 1960s, approximately 44 per cent. of children left school with no qualifications while, in the 1980s, only 12 percent, of school leavers had no qualifications? Does that have something to do with comprehensive education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has more to do with the general quality and standards that are demanded in schools and, more importantly, the perceptions that young people have of the demands of the labour market when they leave school. Most young people believe that qualifications are essential if they are to get a job and pursue a career when they leave school. We all welcome that.<br><br>
The Labour Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) has a more enlightened view of selection and specialised schools than Opposition members of the Committee appear to have. When members of the Labour city council suggested that the way to solve the imbalance between boys' and girls" places in the city's grammar schools was to abolish the whole lot, the hon. Gentleman said that, on the grounds of parental choice, the variety of education provided in the city and the excellence of the standards maintained by those schools, they should remain. The hon. Gentleman is one of the few enlightened Labour Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had misgivings about our amendment because I thought that there was nothing particularly sinister in the clause, but the cat has been thoroughly let out of the bag by the hon. Members for Wyre Forest and for Rugby and Kenilworth. They seek a return to the grammar school system, full stop. I wish to reiterate what I have previously said in Committee—while the grammar school system worked very well in its time, we must move onwards and upwards and improve standards.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
In my constituency, the inaccurate lists that were produced by the Minister for public consumption show that more pupils at comprehensives got five or more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 978</span>
GCSEs at the appropriate level than those at grammar schools. The previous set of results produced by the grammar schools in my constituency showed that only 50 per cent. of their pupils got five or more GCSEs. That is a startling improvement in an area that has specific problems.<br><br>
It was only with the introduction of comprehensive schools in my area that real choice came. Latin and Greek was not taught in a single grammar school, yet, when the comprehensives were introduced, pupils were able to opt for both Latin and classical Greek. The variety of choice and the ability of parents to choose a local comprehensive is infinitely more desirable than the type of schools suggested by the hon. Members for Wyre Forest and for Rugby and Kenilworth.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has his childrens' interests at heart; I would never deny that. But when I listened to his views this morning, I thought, "There is another set of children who I must pray for each night, so that they may be rescued from their father."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that it was eminently predictable that the clause would raise a lot of heat. I shall leave it to the Committee to judge how much light has been cast as a result, but it is an important clause and it is right that we should spend time on it.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for Wyre Forest for explaining better than I ever could why we do not have the sense of shame about a diverse educational system which Opposition Members persist in trying to attribute to us. It is regrettable because the purpose of such Committee proceedings is to have a political dialogue so that one side of the Committee may reveal its thoughts to the other, in the hope that there will be persuasion, political conversion, or simply an explanation of what lies behind respective thoughts and philosophies. My hon. Friends did that, not only with their usual skill, but with passion and commitment, which should not be underestimated. Even if Opposition Members cannot find themselves in agreement, I hope that they will at least acknowledge the sincerity of the Conservative view.<br><br>
A diverse system of education that allows parents to decide what kind of education they would like children to receive and caters for people with a different view on education—including not only governors, but heads and teachers—must be in the best interests of our children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain to the Committee the way in which his concept of choice works for parents who allow their children to sit the 11-plus because they want them to go to a grammar school, when, if such children fail it, they have to go to a secondary modern school? How does choice operate in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has described the circumstances that my two daughters and I were in. One attended a girls' grammar school, the other a comprehensive. We would have had a choice of schools in any case and I have no problem with my children having attended the schools that they did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not a secondary modern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be becoming agitated about whether a school is labelled comprehensive or secondary modern. Appellation is not of great significance. I am not uncomfortable with the education
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 979</span>
that my daughters received in the state system. They have received the sort of education that the hon. Member for Warrington, South asked about. I am responding to the hon. Gentleman as a parent. I was relaxed about the process and happy with the choice of schools that my daughters and I had.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a point of semantics. Where grammar schools exist, in my borough for example, there are also secondary moderns, not comprehensives. A comprehensive is an all-ability schools that takes pupils on the basis of choice, not selection. Will the Minister respond to that?<br><br>
The Committee is not interested in personal anecdotes, but in the Government's view. The Minister responds for the Government, not his children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can forget what I said about my circumstances; discussing them was a moderately appropriate way of dealing with the question that I was asked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a most revealing comment. Time after time we hear from Opposition Members that Ministers do not educate their children in the state system, but when my hon. Friend told them that he did, they did not want to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. What was said had not escaped my notice, but I feel sufficiently charitable that I do not want to pursue the matter with Opposition Members.<br><br>
The amendment would undermine and run counter to the concept of grant-maintained status, as have so many of the Opposition's amendments. That is understandable as Opposition hon. Members have made no secret of that being their objective. The amendment is yet another attempt to compromise grant-maintained status, a key element of which is schools becoming autonomous and independent of their LEAs and, through a parental ballot, becoming more responsive to the needs and wishes of parents and the local community. We have to examine the amendment against that background.<br><br>
The Bill and clause 85 will provide an even-handed approach which would be destroyed if the amendment were passed. It will be some time before we discuss clause 205(7). However, by way of an amendment to the Education Act 1980, it provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"Before publishing the proposals"—</p></blockquote>
for a change in the character of LEA schools—
<br><blockquote><p>"the local education authority shall consult such persons as appear to them to be appropriate; and in discharging their duty under this subsection, the authority shall have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of grant-maintained schools or the funding agency for schools having a power to consent or dissent to a change of character application by the LEA. That is significant because yet again, Opposition Members are trying to hog-tie grant-maintained schools should they wish to apply to change character, but are silent on whether the same limitations should be put on LEAs. If they thought for a moment, they would realise that that runs counter to their beliefs. I respect their views. I hope that, on reflection, they will respect the significance of grant-maintained status.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman remind himself of the basic fact that LEAs, not the funding authority, are democratically accountable and are the only local bodies that are elected with any public responsibility?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Grant-maintained schools are accountable and contain a considerable elected element. Although I am tempted to do so, I shall not weary Opposition Members with the old fact that the parental turn-out for ballots of grant-maintained schools are higher than those for local authority elections. We shall not go into it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being mischievous. If a school achieves grant-maintained status, there will be no further consultation with parents, teachers or the community about its status. There is no accountability, other than through the election of parent governors to the governing body. Such elections are restricted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that there is consultation. We are arguing about whether an LEA would have a veto over the process. The heart of the clause refers explicitly to consultation. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before publishing any proposals under this section the governing body shall consult such persons as appear to them to be appropriate; and, in discharging their duty under this subsection the governing body shall have regard to any guidance given to them from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State's guidance will enable the governing body to consult widely. There is a world of difference between consultation and giving an LEA a veto over the process. The debate on the amendment is about that distinction.<br><br>
Let us be factual for a change. We have all aired our prejudices freely this morning. I shall inject a modest amount of factual material into the debate, which may help members of the Committee, in particular the hon. Member for Dewsbury. She became rather exercised about selection. I shall tease members of the Committee a little by keeping them waiting for the facts and discuss selection.<br><br>
I shall quote from the White Paper, something which has not been done for a while. It is time that we listened to a relevant quote from it. Paragraph 1.48 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For a non-selective school to become selective—or vice versa—involves a significant change of character in the school and thus requires the approval of the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
We all know that very well. The paragraph continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will continue the practice of treating each application on its merits and will consider all applications in the context of the educational needs and provision of the area in which they are made. It is not the Government's intention either to encourage or to discourage such applications."</p></blockquote>
The relevance of the quotation is that, unlike the excitable comments on selection from Opposition Members this morning, the White Paper gives a measured view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment because I am about to do something which I do rarely. I shall use the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), who said, "Nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out". That encapsulates our view on selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the Minister say that. Has he seen what has been written in <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> hardly a far-left newspaper, about the consistency between what his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said previously and what he is saying now?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can encapsulate it simply for the Minister. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> has written that his right hon. Friend wrote one thing and is now doing another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no evidence of that. It is appropriate that I come to the factual material to which I alluded. I shall say why it is difficult to find a factual basis. The figures will illustrate that point well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister will change direction, but before he begins what I am sure will be an important part of his speech, may I return to his quotation from the White Paper and ask him to contrast his description of the Secretary of State's role and his account of the LEA's role, as specified in the amendment? He described the amendment as giving the local authority a veto, of all things, over action for grant-maintained schools. Will he confirm that the Secretary of State has just such a veto? Is the Minister therefore telling the Committee that he prefers a nationalised veto to a locally sensitive one? Is that a fair summary of the Government's view?</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I shall dissent from it, if the hon. Gentleman wishes to characterise the matter in that way. That option is probably preferable because, apart from anything else, it would provide uniformity of approach across the country, which would be missing were we to allow different LEAs vetos as described in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has quoted from the White Paper and asks us to believe what is written there. Would he explain why the guarantees given by the then Secretary of State when the Education Reform Bill was in Committee to the effect that no school would be able to change its character for five years, were forgotten after a short time, so that changes of character could take place almost at will? How can we now believe the assurances of the present Secretary of State, as they appear in the White Paper, after that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because things change; thoughts mature and develop, circumstances alter.<br><br>
This Committee, although occasionally tedious, is also, sometimes, revealing. Time and again Opposition Members reveal their truly and profoundly conservative characters and intuition. I, of course, welcome the fact that the hon. Member for the City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) is at heart a Conservative. He does not want change at all. He has just told us that it is appalling that one Secretary of State should hold different views from those of a predecessor. That attitude contrasts with that of my hon. Friends on the Conservative Benches, who are dynamic, radical where necessary and prepared to make changes when they are justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to another Conservative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in two or three years the Government will advance proposals to compel all schools to become grant maintained, whereas they now suggest that that should be a matter of choice?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, there are no such plans or intentions. We rest our case, with confidence, on the concept of parental balloting. The hon. Gentleman should be well aware of that—as my hon. Friends are. We are confident that parents will increasingly see the virtues of grant-maintained status for their schools, and will vote accordingly in ballots. The fact that, to date, eight out of 10 schools that have held ballots have approved grant-maintained status gives me confidence for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> has already been referred to, perhaps two sentences from it—I do not wish to quote at length—might help discussion. The first states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is already ample evidence that schools are transformed by being made responsible for their own destinies."</p></blockquote>
The second states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such clear encouragement to specialise was a significant and logical development of government policy."</p></blockquote>
Far from suggesting a change of mind on the part of the Secretary of State since previous reforms, the article suggests that that reform is continuing on the crest of a wave. The only criticism of the Secretary of State is that he has not made more publicity out of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Our policies are, of course, a seamless robe. They develop as time and circumstances change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister truly believes that, I ask him to consider another quotation from the same article:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under John Patten … the education scene has been characterised by a series of stuttering starts … interspersed with confusion and bad-tempered bickering."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bring this exchange to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall continue and if my hon. Friend still wants to intervene later, I shall give way.<br><br>
Let me make a confession to the Committee, which I do occasionally to cleanse the soul and the conscience: I rarely believe what I read in newspapers. What is written there is no more or no less than the views of individuals with the human frailties that we all share. That is why—I should confess this reluctantly—I rarely, if ever, read newspaper leader columns; no matter how august, they are merely the views of an individual. Therefore, I am not impressed by quotations from newspaper articles, especially if they refer to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I know his intrinsic worth, his integrity and his intentions and I am not remotely interested in a journalist's view of him. Having placed my little confession on record, we should press on.<br><br>
I am eager to get to the facts because they will help the Committee. To date, 46 grant-maintained schools have published change-of-character proposals, 20 of which have so far been determined. The breakdown of those cases is interesting: 10 were for a change of age range; 10 were for the addition of a sixth form; one was for significant enlargement of premises; one was for the addition of boarding accommodation; and one was for introduction of selection. That is hardly an avalanche or a tidal wave. Even more interestingly, 45 per cent. of the proposals were linked with and prompted by local education authority reorganisations. Approximately, 50 other grant-maintained schools have expressed an interest in publishing proposals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0649">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 983</span>
Those facts tell the story of some, rather prosaic, changes that are being made, largely in response to local education authority changes. There is no great rush for schools to become selective, as Opposition Members suggest constantly. Selection may have its place in the education system. We have no axe to grind on that and we shall not prejudge. The Secretary of State will take a view, as and when selection proposals are made, after due consultation, as provided for in the Bill. That is clear. It is wrong and misguided for Opposition Members to try to interpose into that procedure what I have styled—accurately, I believe—a local education authority veto. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most illuminating debate. I have always thought that the Bill has a hidden agenda and that behind each clause lurks the cloaked figure of ill intent. A shaft of light has shone through the Committee this morning, provided initially by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. I now understand why the Minister has kept most Conservative Members firmly in their seats, but obviously this morning he could not restrain the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth said, has let the cat out of the bag.<br><br>
The Secretary of State and the Minister, who read from the White Paper, have told us that the Government have no intention of introducing selection. However, that is not what Conservative Members have been saying this morning. In fact, they have been saying the opposite. That view was expressed by the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth, for Wyre Forest and for Battersea. They all spoke eloquently about the advantages of the grammar school system, but they were somewhat coy when asked to tell us about the advantages of the secondary modern system. We heard very little about those on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman could not have been listening. I referred specifically to the non-grammar schools in my borough in which pupils went on to higher education, including entry to Oxford and Cambridge, at the same pace as those in grammar schools. I praised the achievements of those non-grammar schools.<br><br>
I also said that I did not think that the grammar school system was the only one that achieved results. The hon. Gentleman should look at the results of schools in the borough of Wandsworth since it rescued education from the inner London education authority. Wandsworth sought to improve the quality of education, not least by transforming—as is about to happen—one of the schools that was not achieving good results into a city technology college in the teeth of opposition from the Labour nominees on the school's governing body and from the Labour party nationally. The changes that we have introduced in the non-grammar schools system are just as important as those which have been achieved in the grammar school system in another London borough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. We have just heard one of the weasel words used to describe secondary moderns. The hon. Gentleman calls them non-grammars. The Minister has described them as comprehensive, a description which I find
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
incomprehensible. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest had a range of descriptions, but he could not quite utter the words "secondary modern".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little hesitant about intervening, not having been present for the earlier part of the debate, but I must say something about secondary moderns. My wife spent the early part of her career and a considerable number of years working in secondary modern schools. Neither she nor I are opposed in principle to the comprehensive ideal or to comprehensive schools. However, we refute totally the repeated implication that secondary modern schools were never successful, that they were second-class schools and that their pupils never achieved university entrance.<br><br>
We do not want to reverse the clock. No one is suggesting that we should go back to the 1950s or 1960s and the old system that was in place then. These provisions look to the future. But I repeat that I resent—as my wife would—the constant denigration of the work of so many good secondary modern schools in past years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I want to do is denigrate the work of teachers. I have taught in a grammar school; I also taught in secondary moderns for many years and in comprehensives. My experience, which I bring to the Committee, enables me to say unequivocally that the comprehensive system was best for the vast majority of children.<br><br>
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson), I know about the disappointment that many, children felt in their late teens and twenties because they failed their 11-plus and did not, as they perceived it, have the opportunity to move on.<br><br>
In my city, a recent reorganisation has for the first time given the children in secondary modern schools the opportunity of sixth-form education in their own school. The take-up rate has increased enormously in the past two or three years because the city now has excellent comprehensives with sixth forms. Pupils do not have to transfer to the grammar school or the further education college, which is a long way away.<br><br>
I do not denigrate the work of teachers in secondary modern schools. In fact, many of them over the years have done some of the best work in the educational system. I am simply saying that the system was wrong, not the work of the teachers in the classroom.<br><br>
Some weasel words have been used in our proceedings. In the context of the Bill, the word "choice" hardly even means preference. If there is the choice that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest so eloquently pointed out, it is choice for one sixth of the population and not for the other five sixths.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
We have diversity, which the Minister admitted to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford is a form of nationalisation and state control. That is not diversity. A few moments ago, the Minister even said, "Give us uniformity", and agreed that a nationalised system would be efficacious.<br><br>
It would be interesting to examine one or two examples of when authorities moved from a selective to a comprehensive system. No doubt the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will prick up his ears as I say this. I am even more certain that the hon. Member for Berkshire, East (Mr. MacKay), the Government Whip, would prick up his ears if he were listening. Incidentally, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 985</span>
can reveal that the hon. Gentleman and I have known each other for a long time. Many years ago we were adversaries in Solihull when he was in the young Tories and I was a young socialist. I always got the better of him in argument. In fact, I was elected to that council in 1970. I witnessed a council where I was the opposition. I was the leader of the opposition, its spokesman on housing and social services and, most importantly, I was the oppossition spokesman on education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Such personal reminiscences are interesting but, as I said to other members of the Committee this morning, it would be helpful to the Chair if hon. Members occasionally mentioned the amendment before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to fit in with the general tenor of the debate today, with personal references from the Minister and the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. However, as ever, I shall be guided by your words, Sir John.<br><br>
The point is that that Tory authority chose to go comprehensive. Indeed, Solihull's plans were approved by Baroness Thatcher, as she is now, as has been said many times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They must have been good, then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were good.<br><br>
In 1983, the then Tory authority in Solihull tried to turn back the clock and return to selection. In a sense, selection is the issue under debate. It is why I thought that this historical example would help the Committee. When that authority tried to go back, the most astonishing cycle of events took place: Conservative voters throughout Solihull stood up as one and said no to selection; they wanted to keep their comprehensives.<br><br>
I know why they want to keep their comprehensives. I am looking at some of the results from those comprehensive schools. They show why selection is not wanted. The results at Tudor Grange school—which I attended—as a comprehensive show that 60 per cent. of its youngsters achieved A to C grades at GCSE. As a grammar school, it did not perform as well as that. That is why parents do not want to return to the selective system.<br><br>
Most of all, selection has been rejected throughout the country because it has closed off opportunities for children and choice for parents. Parents who went into the selective system found that they had no choice at all if their children had not jumped the hurdle of the 11-plus. As the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth knows, back in the 1970s only about 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. of children achieved grammar school places. Therefore, 88 per cent. to 90 per cent. of parents did not get their child into a grammar school. It is well documented that parents do not want selection. In the past few years, the Tory county council, with the approval of a Tory Government and even Plymouth city council, has closed seven grammar schools in my city of Plymouth and there has not been a whimper of protest from parents or councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make a slight concession? He said categorically that parents did not support or approve of selection. Will he withdraw a little and say that some parents do not support or approve of selection? We accept that many parents do not like it, but many who do. Our objective is to give the education system the flexibility to respond to that. The hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
Gentleman's statement was so absolute that it denies acceptance or acknowledgement of the fact that there are parents who may support selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may care to reflect on the position in my county of Devon. Some towns are quite isolated from other towns and long distances must be travelled to places such as Okehampton and Ivybridge. Often, the towns are served by country lanes, not main roads. If selection came in at, say, Okehampton community college, parents would rise against it. They would know that it would mean travelling many miles to another school. In areas in the county where there are comprehensive schools, there is no pressure from parents for selection. Only in the few parts of Devon where there are selective schools do some parents opt to put their children through the 11-plus.<br><br>
Plymouth now has a comprehensive system which, to take up the point of the hon. Member for Norwich, North, pevails in 95 per cent. of the schools. I remind the Minister that the number of pupils who elected for the 11-plus examination has dwindled year after year to the point where seven grammar schools have closed without protest from parents. There was no lament for closure of the grammar schools and I assure the Committee that there was none for closure of the secondary modern schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman talks about selection, he talks in the same breath about the 11-plus examination. Does he not agree that we should not equate selection to the 11-plus alone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty with selection is that it closes opportunities and choices, whether through the 11-plus, through schools interviewing parents or other such procedures. I am unhappy about that. True choice comes form parents being able freely to choose between this, that and another good school, not having a quasi-choice of going through a selection process and 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. being disappointed. Parents want a number of good schools in their area from which they can genuinely choose and sufficient room for manoeuvre among the different aspects of education that their children can enjoy. They want a wide range of courses that deal with a full range of ability and the growth of a child's intellect and development between ages 11 and 19. That is what parents want, and what good comprehensive schools deliver, but Conservative Members do not recognise that.<br><br>
I noted with sadness that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not present, talked about secondary modern schools and a more gentle approach. Is he suggesting that 80 per cent. of our children have an approach that perhaps lacks educational vigour or accepts low standards? Is he suggesting a system that has no challenge for those youngsters? Is that what he means by a more gentle approach or is he advocating for 80 per cent. of our children the happiness and painting approach mentioned by the Secretary of State recently in relation to primary schools? I would oppose such an approach. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth commends to the great majority of parents not only lack of choice but low standards and lack of vigour.<br><br>
We want genuine choice for parents between good schools and then, when a child is at school, no waiting for a 12-plus or 13-plus examination before a further choice can be exercised. Schools must be sufficiently well-resourced and equipped to allow parents genuine choice. Most of all, we believe in a uniform system operated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0651">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
without selection, but providing for diversity between schools and allowing comprehensives different forms of development. I should be happy with that, or as the Minister would say, I am relaxed about it. We need vigour, and rigour, in education and high standards for all children, not some.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment proposes that there should be no change of character of a school for three years without local education authority or funding agency consent. The reason is obvious, having been brought out clearly during the debate and in the Minister's remarks a short time ago.<br><br>
When schools in an area change character through specialisation or selectivity, other schools there are affected. The Minister spoke about his two daughters, one of whom goes to a grammar school and the other to a comprehensive, illustrating the point clearly. If an area has a grammar school system, the remaining schools are no longer comprehensive because a comprehensive teaches a full range of children. When the top ability group is taken out of that system, the comprehensive becomes a secondary modern school. Schools and their systems are interlinked. We cannot treat one school in isolation because a change of character affects profoundly the remaining educational systems. It is important to remember that.<br><br>
I hope, Sir John, that you will allow me to reflect personally, as other hon. Members have done, on my experience of selective and comprehensive education, in the hope of persuading Conservative Members of the importance of retaining comprehensive schools and not returning to a selective system.<br><br>
My conversion to the comprehensive idea began in the 1960s, after I passed my 11-plus and went to grammar school. The school that I attended became comprehensive while I was there. It was one of Alec Glegg's first comprehensives in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It gave me a good opportunity to observe how the change from grammar school to comprehensive affected the children.<br><br>
Some children were disaffected in the grammar school system, which was rigidly streamed. For children who did not make it to the A or B stream, there was little prestige. As a result, they had little self-esteem and, therefore, performed poorly. However, those children were in the top 25 per cent. for ability in any area. The grammar school system meant that the children in the C stream performed well below their potential.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The system was even worse for children who failed the 11-plus. They went to secondary modern schools. Although Conservative Members often talk about bringing back grammar schools, they rarely talk of bringing back secondary modern schools. I stress that once children are streamed and the top ability range is selected for grammar school, the remaining schools are secondary modern, not comprehensive.<br><br>
In the area where I lived as a child, most of the children who attended secondary modern schools left them without any qualifications. I speak with feelings about that because my brother was one of those. In our family, one child passed the 11-plus—myself—and the other did not. My brother left school without qualifications. Although he obviously has a great deal of ability, he has spent his life
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
in fairly low-paid and low-skilled jobs because of that failure at the age of 11. It is not right to label a child at the age of 11 and condemn him to low pay and low-skilled work. Perhaps some of the children who attended secondary modern schools are contributing to the 3 million on the unemployment register.<br><br>
Following comprehensivisation, a dramatic change occurred. It was not in the high ability range. I know that Labour Members are often accused of wanting to level down, but that was not the case. The school that I attended had a good record of getting children into Oxbridge. That record did not diminish after the school became comprehensive: there was a slight improvement. Passes in A-levels and S-levels remained at the previous high levels and so did the number of Oxbridge scholarships.<br><br>
The change occurred in the morale and self-esteem of the majority of pupils at the school. Examination results steadily improved, as they did in the rest of the country. A child who has not been classified in the top 20 per cent. now stands a far greater chance than he would in 1955.<br><br>
The move to comprehensive schools was also an important change for me. It taught me to value the skills, talents and contributions that could be made by children with different ability levels. That was crucial in my subsequent career as a lecturer in further and higher education and as the head of a department in a scientific research establishment. For those in managerial positions, it is important that they have had the experience of working in a community that is similar to that that they will find in their subsequent career. Very few commercial or public organisations select the top stream of ability only. Everyone has a contribution to make and we should use everyone's talents and skills.<br><br>
I wish to refer to children with specific learning difficulties and the problems that they would face if the system were to revert to one which included specialisation and, therefore, selection. It might be convenient to discuss the experience of people with dyslexia, which it is easy for schools to overlook. In a selective system, dyslexic children tend to get labelled with being low ability. I speak with feeling because my son has had tremendous problems with spelling and literacy. The comprehensive system has served him extremely well, but in a selective system he would have been labelled as a failure—in the words of the hon. Member for Battersea, as being probably non-academic, and in the words of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, as being a lower ability child.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not refer to anybody as non-academic—I am not quite sure to what the hon. Lady is referring. I think that the hon. Lady is right in saying that we must study carefully the needs of children with dyslexic problems. In the selective systems to which I earlier referred, we had a unit attached to a particular school. It did not matter which school the pupils were in because the unit was there for the whole borough. Having said that, I think that there are not enough facilities around the country. In my constituency, we have one of the foremost experts in the country—Dr. Bevé Hornsay—who has her own school, which provides for a wide range of pupils from all types of school.<br><br>
The hon. Lady should also understand that, often, dyslexia experts say that dyslexia can be spotted only in the early stages of secondary school and not always at the primary school, when parents want to pick a suitable school for their child.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0652">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 989</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to non-academic pupils at some stage in his speech. If he reads the <i>Official Report</i> afterwards, he will find the reference.<br><br>
It is extremely difficult to diagnose dyslexia. Very often dyslexic children are labelled as being non-academic and of lower ability than others because of the standard of their work. My son has been successful: he has gained A-levels and has a place at Imperial college to study mathematics next year. That is a tribute to the comprehensive system through which he went.<br><br>
We must encourage schools to treat children as individuals, not to try to fit round pegs into square holes in a particular school. Once a school is labelled as specialising or being selective in a particular area, there is a tendency for that school to try to fit children into a particular slot, rather than to regard them as individuals and to treat them as such, taking into account their specific problems and attributes.<br><br>
The Government's policy of integrating children with special needs into mainstream schools conflicts with their views about selection. Selective schools do not admit children with learning difficulties and they will be encouraged to continue to take that approach by the Government's insistence on the publication of raw examination results, without taking into account the child's ability.<br><br>
The publication of raw examination results will benefit those schools that select children from the higher ability ranges. It becomes difficult for those schools to have an open admissions policy and to admit children who have learning difficulties, either with less academic abilities or with emotional and behavioural problems. I am sorry that the Minister is not listening to my point because I would like him to respond to it. There is a conflict between the integration of children with special education needs into mainstream schools and the Government's policy statement about diversity and specialisation, which leads on to selectivity.<br><br>
The issue of choice is relevant to the amendment, which deals with changing the character of schools. The Minister and several Conservative Members said that the Bill would increase parental choice. Yet choice has always existed for parents. In 1976 and 1978, when my two eldest daughters were choosing their secondary schools under a Labour Government, there was a choice of five schools in the Cambridge area, and there were also two village colleges outside the city. We, as their parents, were able to express a preference for any of those schools.<br><br>
A choice is more difficult to satisfy when there are no surplus places. The Minister has not tackled that, and I hope that he does so later. It is hard enough for parents to achieve their first preference when there are a limited number of places, but it is even more difficult when schools select children on the basis of ability.<br><br>
I shall conclude with two final points. First, choice is a myth in rural schools. If a local rural school became selective, travelling problems mean that parents would find it extremely difficult to send their children to any other school. That is especially true in an area such as Cambridgeshire, where buses are few and far between. Parents who do not have a car available during the day have great difficulty transporting their children to and from school. For many children, the local secondary school is the only practical choice. If that school becomes selective or significantly changes its character in another
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
way, parents will find that their children will be forced to go to a school that they would not have chosen, simply because it is the only school which it is practicable for them to attend.<br><br>
Secondly, I wish to consider the change of character that would occur if 11-to-16 schools decided to become 11-to-18 schools. The present system in Cambridgeshire is very good. We have 11-to-16 schools, an excellent further education college and two sixth-form colleges. Those three latter institutions offer a wide range of subjects. Any child who enters that system has great freedom of choice about whether to study for a mixture of A-levels, GCSEs and technical qualifications. That is an efficient use of resources and constitutes a good education system. The schools, sixth-form colleges and the further education college have an excellent reputation and achieve a high standard of examination results. If schools choose to have their own sixth forms, I fear that the effect on those sixth-form institutions will be deleterious. Taking pupils out of the sixth-form colleges and the further education college and returning them to 11-to-18 schools would diminish the range of subject and choice and prove much more expensive.<br><br>
The amendment is important. It has been shown that when a school changes character much anxiety is aroused about the knock-on effects on other schools in the area. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not having been present for the opening of the debate on the amendments. I have listened to the subsequent debate with great interest and I have had a chance to study the clause again. I shall explain why I oppose the amendments and support the clause as it stands.<br><br>
I always listen with great interest to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) because of her experience in education, especially when she herself was at school. I shall not be so undiplomatic as to suggest when that was, but I recognised the period that she was talking about because I was also involved in education then. I do not think that that is undiplomatic. She made fair criticisms of the grammar and the secondary modern systems as they then were.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Even though I spoke up for teachers and the good work that they do in secondary modern schools, I did not intend to suggest that I am oblivious to the faults in the secondary modern system as it was then. I accept many of the points made by the hon. Lady and I want to underline one. The plight of young people in the lower streams of grammar schools was probably worse than the plight of young people in secondary modern schools. I suspect that those who had experience of education at that time would agree with that. The hon. Lady put the point well and I am not trying to resist it.<br><br>
I disagree with Opposition Members when they try to give the impression that the clause is part of a subtle plot to take us back to the 11-plus. I hope that the Minister will deal with that or reassure me later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, because the general thrust of Conservative education policy in recent years—I hope that I will not upset my friends too much if I make it clear that I have not supported every detail—has been to make progress for the future and not to look back to the past.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend go a little further and say that Conservative education policies are based fundamentally on choice and diversity—the maximum possible choice for parents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read the White Paper and my hon. Friend is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This will be interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tory party education policy may be about choice, but if a grant-maintained school were to obtain approval to become a selective grammar school, the remaining schools in the area would have no choice but to become secondary modern schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refute that suggestion for two reasons. First, it is not a fair description of the intention of clause 85. The hon. Gentleman's intervention confirmed what I said. Opposition Members are obsessed with the idea that Conservative politicians want to bring back a system of the 1950s. That is not true. We refute that: we do not want to bring back systems of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, that is not the intention of the Bill. Secondly, the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman drew was wrong. With so many people seeking to intervene, perhaps I should make progress and give way to the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's points in the spirit in which they are intended. There is possibly a good deal of agreement between us about the difficulties of the old grammar school system. However, if there is to be genuine diversity—which is one of the stated principles of Conservative education policy—schools should be free to specialise. If they are free to specialise, it follows that they are free to select at least some of their pupils to achieve specialisation. If we talk about selectivity, we come close to considering what my hon. Friends describe as a return to the 11-plus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. If I was asked whether it was always wrong for a school to specialise in one subject and become well known for music or science and technology, I should reply, "No". I support choice and diversity in education. I taught for 23 years, and I acknowledge the dangers that the Opposition point out. However, I would never say that there was no place for specialisation in schools or in the education system. The Opposition lead themselves up a blind alley. They believe that any selection or specialisation is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.<br><br>
One has to be careful about words—some are not politically correct, to use an appalling phrase. Whether one uses words such as streaming, selection, choice, guiding—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. There is a queuing system. In fairness, I must give way to the hon. Member for Hemsworth first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. I have not yet received the corrected version of the Secretary of State's letter to which I referred. I look forward to receiving it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
I believed that the hon. Member for Norwich, North had outlined the purpose of the clause. However, when I heard the speeches of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who has influence in the Tory party, and of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, I realised that they wished to return to the dreadful days of the 1940s and 1950s. Their speeches belonged to those days. If the clause is accepted, I ask the hon. Member for Norwich, North to prevent the interpretation of the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for Wyre Forest from prevailing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the queuing system, it is the turn of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to intervene. That will give him an opportunity to put the record straight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North. He referred to politically correct language. The Opposition have corrected an article that appeared in today's <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"But if there is to be genuine diversity, schools must be free to specialise. If they are to specialise effectively they must be free to select at least some pupils with an aptitude for the speciality."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree with that. He will also agree that it refutes the Opposition's arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not too difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just a moment. Even in a queuing system, I must respond briefly to my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. I rarely disagree with my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Except on education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rarely disagree with him about anything. I agree with him about the topic of our discussion, and I am grateful for his support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members appreciate the hon. Gentleman's efforts to distance himself from the more extreme tendencies in the Conservative party. Does he accept that some Conservative Members favour a return to the tripartite system and that the White Paper hints at that possibility? For example, paragraph 149 of the White Paper contains a veiled defence of the tripartite system when it says that only the absence of a national curriculum prevented pupils from enjoying equal opportunity under it. That suggests that the Government would like to go back to that system, even though the hon. Gentleman does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a chance to hear the Ministers' opinions on that, but that is not my impression. My point is that there is no intention of returning to the old 11-plus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is difficult to select pupils for specialist schools? Paragraph 42 of the draft circular on admission arrangements, which is currently under consultation, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Selection on the basis of aptitude is particularly problematic, as most available tests in fact assess ability rather than aptitude."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that selection for specialist schools will be based on ability rather than aptitude, given that it is almost impossible to assess aptitude, especially when some youngsters may not have studied much of a subject in primary school?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that point, but it would be more suitable to discuss it later. Such detail is not related to my point, which is that clause 85 defines a procedure—by which the governors of a grant-maintained school may bring about a significant change—that is satisfactory, sufficient and worthy of support. Opposition Members are introducing red herrings into the debate. The Lady has made an interesting point, but the introduction into the debate of an argument about the old 11-plus tripartite system is just a red herring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have spent a long time on this matter, but I shall give way to the hon. Member for Warrington, South.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that there is no intention of returning to the old 11-plus, but clause 85 allows schools to become selective grammar schools for pupils aged 11 and upwards. What method of selection will such schools adopt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the same type of intervention that the hon. Gentleman made a moment ago. I shall not give way to him again if he keeps on referring to clause 85 in a way that I do not recognise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is totally wrong. Clause 85 deals with the procedure to be adopted if a grant-maintained school wants to undertake any significant change. My hon. Friend the Minister quoted figures showing the true nature of the present position. Opposition Members only compound their felony when they intervene in that way.<br><br>
The Government do not want to put the clock back and return to the board schools or to the tripartite system. We want to move this country's education system forward. Opposition Members cannot understand that. I do not believe that there is too great a divide between Conservative and Opposition Members about that, although Opposition Members keep trying to create artificial differences. We may have a variety of views on the success or otherwise of the comprehensive system but Conservative Governments have long been supportive of local authorities and schools that have adopted comprehensive education. [<i>Laughter.</i>] That is true. Previous Secretaries of State for Education have been mentioned in that context, which pleases the Minister.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The difference between Conservative and Opposition Members is that Conservative Members do not wear rose-tinted spectacles. We do not bury our heads in the sand and say, "Because there is a comprehensive system in most parts of the country, all is perfect," in a Panglossian way. The hon. Member for Hemsworth will help me in looking for literary quotations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pangloss is perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Before the previous election, which seems a long time ago, I was a member of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts. We spent a long time studying the education of those aged 16 to 18, I think—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Aged 16 to 19.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for City of Durham for correcting me. The hon. Gentleman remembers our detailed deliberations. We travelled to Sweden—the hon. Gentleman may not want me to pursue this point further—and to Germany. My memory and notes are not good enough for me to go into the detail that hon. Members clearly require. However, I recall that there was a difference between the education systems in those two countries; they approached education from opposite ends of the spectrum. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that we found good things in both countries, just as there are good things in education in this country.<br><br>
One reason why the Select Committee chose that topic was because all is not perfect in our education system. Any teacher, ex-teacher, politician, local government administrator, school inspector or anyone else who says that education is perfect and that there is no reason to change is talking arrant nonsense, as anyone with experience in education knows.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It puzzles me why he did not support the amendment tabled at our previous sitting by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), which acknowledged that things were not perfect and therefore sought safeguards in respect of quality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You would not thank me, Sir John, if I were to repeat the debate on the previous amendment. My recollection is that I did not agree with the detail of the amendment. Of course, we all seek quality in education. The hon. Gentleman conceded my main point, that the education system at any given time is imperfect and we must seek to improve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have cited my work on the Select Committee as an example. Before I continue, I shall give way to the hon. Member for City of Durham, who may wish to tell us more about what happened in Sweden and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep to the educational aspects of the visit to Sweden and not go into detail about what happened when we were not visiting educational establishments. The hon. Gentleman will remember that we returned enlightened on the educational techniques used in Sweden and Germany. When we returned to this country and attempted to produce a report that would have improved our education for 16 to 19-year-olds, Conservative Members were typically dinosaur in their attitude and refused to produce one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, my memory causes me difficulty in responding accurately—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must have been a hell of a trip.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I cannot remember what happened while we were there or—with the intervention of the general election which, for some of us, was quite exciting—I am finding it difficult to recall our deliberations. Time was a factor and the general election intervened. But very useful work was done and the evidence was published. The Select Committee's finding supports my point: in all the countries that we are discussing, including Sweden and Germany, there are good aspects of their education system from which we can and have learnt and there are other aspects which need reform.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0655">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 995</span>
Germany became more critical of its system and wanted to move in one direction, and Sweden became very critical of its rather extreme version of the comprehensive system—I hope that I am not misrepresenting them—which it thought was failing. Both countries were seeking reform, as are France and the United States. Our progressive, sensible Government are seeking reform in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With sensible and progressive Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to my hon. Friend the Minister later.<br><br>
I shall try to bring my remarks to a conclusion, although interventions are making that difficult. The Select Committee's experience proves my point. We have all read reports in the serious press—never mind the more frivolous organs of the press—in which genuine concern about the educational system of this country is expressed. All is not perfect in the educational system at the moment. Business people have been surveyed and asked how they feel about the qualifications of young people who join their firms, and whether they are from school or from further or higher education. Some reports are highly critical, although some may be misinformed or may misunderstand the true purpose of education. But it would be silly if the Committee dismissed the reports and said that there was nothing wrong with the education system and left everything as it was.<br><br>
There is also concern about the behaviour of young people in schools. It would be wrong for anybody involved in the teaching profession or for parents to say, "Everything is perfect in our schools, we should leave everything alone." I think that I have made my point. Opposition Members are wrong to suggest that we should remain where we are, instead of progressing according to this or any other good education Bill. It is clear from the debate that they are losing their argument.<br><br>
Opposition Members have referred to parental dissatisfaction in schools. The hon. Member for Cambridge rightly referred to the dissatisfaction of parents whose children were in secondary modern schools. That was political reality. I remember the great debates between Lord James of Rusholme and the leading proponents of the comprehensive ideal. At the time, I was working at Manchester grammar school and there was little doubt in my mind which side I was supposed to be on, but good points were made on both sides of the debate.<br><br>
There was much parental dissatisfaction. Any Conservative Member who has studied the history of our education system would concede that irrespective of the then Government, that dissatisfaction has led to change and to the system that we have now, although we still have remnants of the earlier system. There has always been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
parental dissatisfaction, and there always will be. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) looks puzzled. If parental dissatisfaction were not being expressed, there would be no pressure for schools to do better. I shall be literary again, but I shall need the help of the hon. Member for Hemsworth because I am a scientist and I struggle a little—eternal dissatisfaction is a virtue not a vice. We want parental dissatisfaction to challenge schools to change and to improve.<br><br>
I seem to have gone on at much greater length than I originally intended. It was an interesting debate, even before I rose to my feet. The Government have got the balance right. The way in which Opposition Members have conducted the debate has shown the weakness of their argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always seem to speak when we are coming to the end of a sitting. I only wish that the hon. Member for Norwich, North had had a little more to say and had continued until one o'clock. However, we listened to him for 25 minutes, so perhaps it was time for him to sit down.<br><br>
I fear that the hon. Member for Norwich, North has protested far too much. Most of his speech was spent protesting about our suggestion that the Government intend to take us back to the 1950s and early 1960s. Whether he likes it or not, the clause will take us back to those days. He may not want that. I have no reason to believe that he was not sincere—we had a good relationship while we were members of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts. We were on very good terms.<br><br>
The clause as drafted, will take us back to the dreadful days of the 1950s when we had selection and the 11-plus. If the hon. Gentleman genuinely believes what he said, I suggest that he supports our amendment to ensure that we do not go back to those dreadful days.<br><br>
The clause refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a significant change in the character … of the school".</p></blockquote>
Those words are ambiguous and are open to subjective interpretation. Any change may be interpreted as significant.<br><br>
It is important to be open and honest about a change in the character of any school, whatever the degree of that change. A change to the character of a school suggests either a change in age range or in the provision and type of education in the school. Such changes are likely to involve selection, and that is what the clause is about.<br><br>
In Penrith in Cumbria there are two secondary schools. One is an 11–16 LEA school.</span></p>
