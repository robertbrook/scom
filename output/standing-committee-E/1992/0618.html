<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tim Yeo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. I shall have a word with my righ hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport to secure improvements in the rail system from the north-east so that you will not be inconvenienced by not being able to attend the sittings of the Committee.<br><br>
I explained on Tuesday why I oppose this group of amendments. I shall now deal briefly with the specific points that were raised in that debate. No local authority will be forced to contract with any provider who does not meet the requirements in the amendments. The question of money was raised. Amendment No. 2 seeks to provide that, for example, pensions payable to residents should be paid to them direct, unless they are incapable of managing their own affairs. That is unnecessary as it is already an established principle that all social security benefits—not only pensions—are paid direct to the person in respect of whom they are awarded, unless that person is incapable of managing his or her own affairs. The amendment would not introduce anything new.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister not aware of the standard practice in many establishments, in both the public and the private sectors, that on admission the individual resident hands over his pension book? That is the reality. The Minister says that that does not happen. It happens in practice throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that that does not happen. The hon. Gentleman should listen. I am saying that, as a principle, social security benefits are paid direct to the person to whom they have been awarded. For the convenience of that person, someone else may collect his pension. That practice is used outside residential homes; many people get others to collect their pensions for them. Such an arrangement is a great convenience for all sorts of people. It is an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
entirely voluntary arrangement. If the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) is saying that income support benefits are being misappropriated, that is a matter that the Department of Social Security would wish to investigate. The same applies to pocket money, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) who is absent at the moment.<br><br>
On complaints, whether of abuse, which was referred to in amendment No. 18, or more generally, the Registered Homes Act 1984 already requires that residents should be given advice on how they can make complaints in the home and to the registration authority, which can then initiate appropriate investigations and action. People placed in accommodation by a local authority can make use of the complaints procedures which all local authorities must operate in respect of their social services functions. Those complaints systems have been in place since April last year and offer a formal complaints procedure for the first time to anyone in a home that is not covered by the Registered Homes Act complaints procedure.<br><br>
I share the concern of Opposition Members to ensure that residents in homes are not subject to abuse or to inappropriate forms of restraint. I recognise the deep public anxiety about that. I believe that the owners and managers of homes take those risks seriously. There is no lack of awareness of either the risks of abuse or the problems of restraint. Like all other citizens, residents have civil rights. If the abuse amounted to a criminal offence, it could warrant police involvement and there would be a remedy through the criminal justice system.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rochdale referred to the Buxton chair. The hon. Lady is not in her place, so if she wishes to pursue the matter I shall write to her.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wakefield asked about people moving from care into nursing homes or, indeed, in the other direction. From April 1993 local authorities will be responsible for assessing the care needs of individuals and for arranging appropriate packages of care services to meet those needs. That assessment process will involve a variety of professionals. Our guidance makes it clear that appropriate medical and nursing advice should always be sought when admission to residential nursing home care is being considered. Assessment is not a once-and-for-all process: it can be followed by reassessment, in the light of the changing needs of any individual. When local authorities are responsible, I have no doubt that particular attention will be given to people who are moving from care to nursing homes or, indeed, in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's comments on this point. After the system changes in April, what mechanisms will exist to check whether a person in a dual-registered establishment who moves from social care to nursing care actually requires and receives that care, and to ensure that that person can be moved back to social care when his or her condition improves? What mechanism will there be after 1 April to ensure that that happens?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who is going into nursing care as opposed to residential care is subject to the health
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
authority's approval for entry, so an additional safeguard is built into the system, which will apply even when someone remains in the same establishment because it has dual registration.<br><br>
I have no doubt that local authorities, in discharging their duties under the Act from next April, will want to introduce a process which allows for individual needs to be reassessed from time to time, if it looks as though those needs might change. That does not seem a difficult thing to do, whether it is done through the social worker, or, conceivably, through a general practitioner for someone entering residential care for the first time. There are a number of ways to achieve that, but we ought not to prescribe precisely how it should be done in every case. I believe that local authorities are mindful of their responsibilities in this area and I do not believe that they will find them particularly difficult to discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be taking the line that was taken by the Opposition during the Committee stage of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. The idea that was proposed then, which is exactly the point that the Minister is making, was resisted by his colleague, who is now Secretary of State for Health. What guidance will the Minister give to local authorities about the requirement to review? Would it not make more sense at this stage to consider fixing that requirement in statute—as happens, for example, with children?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe so. The variation in the needs of individuals who will be dealt with by local authorities will be so great that it would not be possible to prescribe in primary legislation a system which would be equally applicable to every case. The general responsibility of the local authorities is clear. Various people, such as carers and families, will also be taking an interest in the individual's concerned and will be ready to ensure, when someone's needs have changed sufficiently for a reassessment, or at least a change in placement to be considered, that the local authority's social services department consider the matter.<br><br>
I do not believe that this will be a difficult issue, especially for those local authorities whose social services departments are run with even a modicum of efficiency. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I am sorry that the hon. Member for Wakefield finds that so funny. There are some local authorities—controlled, on the whole, by Labour—about which we have concern. On the whole, however, I believe that the good example set in many parts of the country can in due course be emulated by even by those authorities which I have in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Tessa Jowell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister prepared to name the Labour local authorities that give him cause for concern?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the context of this Committee, I am not sure that it would be helpful. I shall name one—Camden—which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had to call in for discussions last year because of her concerns about the way it ran its social services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
department. There are others—some not very far from here. It would not require a great deal of intelligence work to identify them, but I am not sure that it is relevant to our discussion. On the whole, most local authority social services departments do a good job. I hope that the good practice that is established in most parts of the country will in due course be followed by those authorities that are currently recalcitrant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that we are straying slightly from the central point, but the Minister has made serious comments about certain local authorities that cannot be allowed to pass without further comment. Will the Minister read, perhaps before the next sitting of the Committee, the report of the Select Committee on Health on the allocation of child care cases? That report examined in particular the problems facing a number of London boroughs. Will the Minister reflect on the difficulties in personal social services provision facing those boroughs by virtue of the manner in which the Government have handled the standard spending assessment procedures and the allocation of finance by the Government to local authorities? The Select Committee, with a majority of Conservative Members, was highly critical of the Government's lack of funding of local authorities, particularly in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look at the report, but I cannot report to the Committee on it because it does not relate to the matters under discussion.<br><br>
In conclusion, I wish to emphasise the crucial role played by the contracting process, alongside the regulatory duties and powers of the local authorities. The local authorities are purchasers of community care. It is up to them to do the best that they can for their clients. I have no doubt that many of the standards that have been the subject of debate on the amendments will be achieved through the contractual process. Equally, I have no doubt that the local authorities will monitor the performance of the providers to ensure that they match up to the terms of the contracts. For all those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. McWilliam. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair.<br><br>
I wish to make a few remarks directed at one of the amendments. I give notice that we shall seek, in due course, to divide the Committee on amendment No. 21.<br><br>
The Minister is not getting off on the right foot with his knee-jerk reaction of slagging off local authorities that do not happen to be of the political persuasion of the governing party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.<br><br>
The Minister's comments are not conducive to good progress on the Bill. They are not conducive to the ability of the Minister to work with local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
authorities and social workers. Some social workers do an extremely dangerous job. I have been to more memorial services for social workers killed on the job than for any other group of workers in my constituency. The Minister's typical anti-Labour local government claptrap is not a suitable way to start. I shall not respond in kind, but I wish to put it on the record that the Minister's comments were intolerable. I shall gladly give way if the Minister will apologise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to apologise but to explain to the hon. Member that when I referred to my confidence in the ability of local authorities to do the job that the legislation will give them, the hon. Member for Wakefield mocked my suggestion, as though he felt that the local authorities will not be able to do the job. I believe that they will. One of the ways to demonstrate that is to monitor the performance of the authorities. Some, I am afraid, give us cause for concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. In the last few months I have read a good selection of the draft community care plans. There is cause for concern about local authorities under the control of all parties and no party. I have not singled out one particular group because I was examining the way in which local authorities are gearing up and producing their draft community care plans. I do not slag off local authorities under the control of the Minister's party. The terminology of all the political parties gave me cause for concern. I tried to take an overview to get the best out of the system and find the weaknesses. I am prepared to admit that there are weaknesses in all sectors. It would be nice if the Minister would admit that because, if he does not, he will be in trouble after next April.<br><br>
I wish to concentrate on amendment No. 19 which relates to nursing and medical needs, and to one aspect of those in particular—community continence services. If the Minister cannot respond to my points this morning, perhaps he could contact me later.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Late last year I did a survey of health authoritiy attitudes to and policy on community continence services. One in 20 people in this country suffer from continence problems; some 2.3 million people. It is not a high-profile subject and I pay tribute to the dedicated professionals who provide those services for our fellow citizens. There is much ignorance about that sort of medical need, particularly among general practitioners. However, I shall concentrate on the health services' attitude to people living in the community but usually outside their own homes—that is, in residential homes.<br><br>
I asked health authorities what I thought were five simple questions. However, each question had two subsections to it and it has taken me about four months to analyse the response that I received. I had responses from 86.5 percent of health authorities, or 165 authorities. That was a substantial wad of detail. I want to share with the Minister the broad statistical breakdown because it highlights a problem relevant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
to the type of residential accommodation that we are discussing.<br><br>
I asked health authorities whether they supplied continence aids to patients who lived in residential homes and whether they sold aids to the owners of nursing homes. There is a legal difference, so I concentrated on residential homes. Eighty-three authorities, 51 percent of those responding, supplied named patients in homes, not the homes per se; 20 authorities—12 per cent—supplied patients in both residential and nursing homes; 12 authorities supplied patients in nursing homes, but not residential homes; 44 authorities, 28 per cent, did not supply patients in residential or nursing homes.<br><br>
I take a simplistic view about the matter. There is considerable divergence of policy among district health authorities. That is partly caused by the operation of circular HN (88)26, which reminded authorities that they can supply patients in their own homes for free and that they could supply patients in residential care. Authorities, because of the use of the words "could" and "may", withdrew supplies to patients in residential homes across the country. That has caused considerable difficulties.<br><br>
I asked health authorities whether people living in residential homes should receive equal treatment in respect of a public service, irrespective of whether they are in local authority, private sector or voluntary sector homes and irrespective also of whether they are self-funded—mainly by the use of disposable assets, such as the family home—or funded by the Department of Social Security.<br><br>
For people in residential homes, such accommodation is their home. They may not have their own front door with a letter box, though some do. We are discussing people who are in residential homes, as opposed to those in residential care, and who have more facilities and independence than people usually have in traditional residential care establishments. Even to pose the question of whether people who live in residential homes should receive the same public service as people living in their own homes is to answer it. Such people should not be treated any differently.<br><br>
Some health authorities had doubts, but I shall not go through my summary of quotes. I am talking about supplying named patients in homes who have had proper nursing assessments. I am not talking about abnormal cases. Some authorities said, "We supply patients who are in a home if they are paying their own fees, but we do not supply them if they are not." If a patient lives in his or her own home and receives an intensive care package, which costs several hundred pounds per week and which is funded, for example, by the independent living fund, and if he or she receives some private sector weekend and night care, some voluntary sector day care and some local authority care, that person's individual needs will be met by the health authority. If that person requires continence aid services, he or she will receive them. What is the difference between that person, who lives in his or her own home, due to the funding provided by the independent living fund, and someone in residential care, who is funded
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
by the public sector via income support? There is no difference, morally or intellectually, and no reason why two people with the same nursing needs should be treated differently by the health authority. That is a major problem, which I ask the Minister to address.<br><br>
I am not acquainted with the situation at the particular homes we are discussing because I did not ask them about that. One health authority told me about its policy towards people in sheltered housing. I had not counted people in sheltered housing as being in residential homes. Someone in sheltered housing owns his own home as much as anyone who owns or rents his home. Such a person has a tenancy agreement and should not be treated differently by the health authority.<br><br>
There is a great divergence in the policies pursued by health authorities through the country. I shall give the Committee only a flavour of that divergence. I shall gladly hand out a copy of the report that I produced in February, which became rather wrapped up with other matters that arose the following month.<br><br>
A copy of that report was sent to every health authority. Instead of telling readers to write to me, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> included my telephone number at the House of Commons and the switchboard was clogged. Nevertheless, I issued more than 400 copies: 200 to health authorities and the others on request. I detected a change of policy in some areas, which needs addressing. Without boring hon. Members, I shall give the Committee a flavour of that change. I listed each health authority by name, but I did not disclose the policy of any particular one. I did not want to set one health authority against another.<br><br>
There is an enormous divergence of policy within different regions. Adjoining health authorities have totally different policies. For example, in the Yorkshire region, one authority said that continence aids were supplied to local authority and private residential homes. Another authority in the Yorkshire region said that it supplied continence aids only to private sector residential homes, thus differentiating between the sectors. In that way, the cost of these aids to health authority was transferred to the local authority. The Minister seems satisfied that the division between social services and health authorities will be tidied up and codified, but, to see warning bells ringing, we need only consider the provision of community continence services. That is a classic example of the way in which health authority budget costs can be shifted to local authority social services. That requires further consideration.<br><br>
One of the authorities in the west midlands said that it supplied patients in residential care with continence aids free of charge for personal use; that is what one would expect. Another authority in the same area said that its policy was not to supply anyone who was not living in his or her own home. That major difference in policy has been brought about by the loose wording of the circular, which requires consideration. If constituents are to receive equal treatment, wherever they live, be it in residential homes or their own homes, policy on this sensitive, highly personal area, cannot be left to each health authority. Social services departments will put pressure on the Minister.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
In the survey, I also asked about the number of patients in the community who were being supplied by the health authorities. One health authority said that it supplied 4,000 patients in the community, whereas another said that it supplied only 200—an enormous variation. Some authorities do not even advertise the service. One said that it did not advertise so as not to create a waiting list. That is the attitude of some health authorities today. I am ashamed to say that that was one in the west midlands—not in Birmingham, but close to it. Other authorities actively attempt to meet people's needs by holding clinics in city centre chemist shops. They say, "This is a sensitive area; come and talk to someone about it." Some authorities talk to owners and managers of residential nursing establishments and say, "This is a major problem; we have to provide a service." One health authority said that it did not supply continence aids to patients in residential homes because people with continence problems should be in nursing homes. What does that say to the millions of citizens in their own homes, who are supplied with community continence services by other health authorities? There is a massive divergence of policy on that.<br><br>
I used amendment No. 19 in order to raise that specialist and narrow point, but I did so with some knowledge of health authority policy. I probably know more than anyone else in this Room about the community continence services policies of the 165 health authorities in the country. They do not even seem to talk to each other. I also highlighted good practice. In one urban, northern authority, the two continence nurses who looked at my final statistical analysis said, "Wow! This is the place with the right policies." I highlighted another authority in the south. They are easily identifiable by those who know them. One was Stockport, the other was Bath. Those authorities are absolutely first class. I have highlighted their policies in some detail as an aid to other health authorities.<br><br>
The issue requires consideration by Ministers. May I say, without churlishness, that had the result on 9 April been different the Labour party would have addressed that problem. The varying policies of health authorities must not be allowed to continue, although they should have discretion and be able to manage their affairs to meet the needs of local people. I discovered a wide divergence of policies towards advertising services and people in their own homes. I discovered that people in residential care were treated differently, according to whether they were self-funded or funded by the state. That cannot, in all conscience, continue because it means that citizens are not receiving equal treatment from the public health service, which is part of the national health service.<br><br>
That is a legitimate matter to raise, especially in relation to small homes, where there is probably less expertise. Will the Minister consider that? He need not respond in detail this morning; perhaps he would write to me. I shall happily provide him with a copy of the report, which I neglected to send to Ministers in March. I had other things on my mind. The professionals have seen it and found the information helpful in correcting variations of policy at local level.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
In that helpful spirit, not seeking to slag off Tory-controlled health authorities or Labour-controlled health authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was my point. We do not have democracy in the health authorities, but my point was obviously too subtle.<br><br>
I had hoped that the Minister would take a more positive attitude towards the amendments. While it is not possible to prescribe everything in legislation. Ministers should adopt a more positive approach towards the need for quality of service in residential accommodation. The Minister said that it is easy to produce a list of good things. That is true. It is simple, but not enough people do it. If one draws up a list of the most simple, reasonable and decent requirements—not a list stating what every home should have—people realise that they are good ideas.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I shall give the Minister one example. At our previous sitting, alarms were mentioned. It is not simply a question of supplying alarms in the bathrooms or bedrooms of residential homes; it goes beyond that in 1992. Modern technology makes it possible for electronic alarm systems to record how long someone waits for help after he or she has used the alarm. In that way, friends or relatives can see how long their mother, grandmother or neighbour waited for help during the night.<br><br>
The owners of some nursing homes have installed that system because it is a management tool: it lets them know whether they have enough staff. It gives owners, social services departments and visitors the opportunity to question whether there are enough staff in the home at night if, for instance, everyone has to wait for 40 minutes after they have used the alarm at 3 o'clock in the morning. We would not know how long people were waiting without the microchip.<br><br>
I do not say that every home should have such an alarm system, but it is a good idea. It is good use of modern technology to assist people who need care, those who manage their care at a personal level and—this is more to the point—advocates, friends and relatives who want to keep a check on the care that individuals are receiving. I do not dismiss the proposal by saying that anyone can draw up a list of good ideas. These are good ideas which can be put into practice around the country.<br><br>
I had hoped that the Minister might have taken a more positive approach to some of the points raised by my hon. Friends. However, I have given notice that in due course we shall seek to divide the Committee on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard much about people who move from service to service, going from home care to residential care, going back home for home care and leaving hospital for residential or perhaps home care. Those services can be provided without too much trouble to the people on the receiving end, who are not interested
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
in who is providing the services and how they are provided. The users and their carers are interested in receiving a service when they require it, rather than going on a waiting list.<br><br>
The group of amendments deals with the quality of life that exists when professionals have fruitful discussions. I shall come later to why I am concerned about some of those discussions. Amendment No. 2 refers to financial arrangements, such as pensions, and would ensure that people did not have to worry about their financial arrangements while they were in residential care. Amendment No. 4 deals, among other things, with the right of residents to have their own room. I think that that is particularly important. I spent five years chairing the social services department of Doncaster metropolitan borough council. We adopted a policy whereby people in care had a right to have their own rooms. Too many establishments provide rooms that must be shared. It is not right that people should have to share rooms in this day and age, unless they want to. While we were making new provisions we ensured that single rooms were available to as many people as possible and kept back double rooms that had been used for one person, so that if married couples came into residence they could use those rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a valuable point in respect of married couples or, perhaps, sisters, but there are other ways of dealing with the problem. Not every establishment should have to keep back double rooms. It is possible to allocate separate but adjoining rooms and construct the building so that one room is a bedroom and one a sitting room. That does not mean a bedsit room for a couple. There can be a good deal of flexibility in homes. I hope that my hon. Friend's local authority acted in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend did not misinterpret my comments. Rooms big enough to accommodate married couples were not being used to accommodate two people in the establishments that we had refurbished. We made sure that in the homes that we had refurbished there was at least one room that could accommodate a married couple. That is not the same as putting two people in a room. That would leave the problem of asking those people to move out if a married couple wanted to move in. It is not on to keep asking people to shift around.<br><br>
A big issue that was, and is, relevant to the homes that are covered in the Bill is that few homes have locks on doors. That is an important issue for people in residential care. Often other residents in the later stages of dementia wander into other people's rooms. Those people believe that they are in their own rooms and may remove goods and equipment, believing that it belongs to them. That causes great strain. Conservative Members should take amendment No. 4 and the issue of locks seriously.<br><br>
I do not accept the safety argument that staff may need to enter a room for various reasons, especially in case of fire. Special locks are available for such accommodation and allow staff to gain access to any particular room, as and when necessary.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
The other part of amendment No. 4 that I am especially keen on is the provision of a visitors' room. It is important that people in residential care have somewhere private to take their visitors and make them a cup of coffee without having to rely on staff. There should be facilities for private discussion of, say, family business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might save the Committee's time—I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is not as familiar with the legisation as some people—if I mentioned that the Registered Homes Act 1984 requires the provision of facilities for private meetings with visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is what the legislation says, but the Minister would agree that it does not always apply on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill deals with homes that are not registered under the Registered Homes Act 1984. My hon Friend is right to make his point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. Some registered homes do not have specific rooms to receive visitors in private. Some of the rooms are too big and other people have visitors in them at the same time. Rooms should be available where people can talk in private about their business with visitors.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 deals with the issue of restraint. Other hon. Members have spoken about the matter, so I shall be brief. Suffice it to say that residents and carers need to feel sure that there will be no misuse of any restraint policy. That is important for carers, residents and their relatives, and anybody else who is involved.<br><br>
Amendment No. 18 deals with abuse by staff. Abuse takes different forms. We have all heard horror stories about physical abuse in some homes, and I do not want to repeat them. However, I am worried about mental abuse, such as keeping information back from residents, isolating them and preventing them from taking part in the general activities of the home, unless they conform. We must ensure that such abuse does not happen.<br><br>
Amendment No. 21 has been well covered by other members of Committee. It deals with privacy, dignity, independence and choice, issues which I believe are especially important. All too often residents in homes, whether small or large, are regimented. Their mealtimes, the time they get up and the time they go to bed are regimented. In some cases, tea of coffee is taken round at 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning to wake them up. Clearly, that is not on. If residents decide that they want to stay in bed until 11 o'clock in the morning, so be it—that is their choice. They should be free to make such a choice. If they want to miss breakfast—again, that is their choice; if they do not want a cup of coffee at 8 o'clock in the morning, they should not receive one; if they want to stay up late to watch a film, they are entitled to do so. Too often, residents in homes are regimented because it is convenient for the staff. Staff should be educated and trained to ensure that such practices do not happen.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
To pull all these issues together, my argument is that professionals—managers and carers—who care for people in residential homes must discuss all the issues and agree on how to bring about quality of care, dignity, privacy and choice for residents. There are several forums in which they can be achieved, such as the joint care planning teams. I want to raise one issue, which horrifies me—perhaps the Minister can respond. District health authorities, social services and the voluntary and private sectors all send representatives to the joint care planning teams and discuss issues such as those raised in our debate on the Bill. Why is it that Doncaster royal infirmary and Mexborough Montague trust will not send representatives to those joint care planning teams? I do not know whether that happens in other parts of the country. How can you try to offer a seamless service, and provide the care that we have discussed, if a key actor in that role will not attend meetings of the joint care planning teams? I wonder if the Minister can tell us whether that is a general policy, or whether it is specific to that trust hospital in Doncaster. I hope that it is not general policy. If it is an isolated case, perhaps, Minister, you will become involved in it. If it is an isolated case, perhaps you could also become involved and ensure that trust hospitals and trust community care teams send people to joint care planning terms. It is important that they participate in such discussions to ensure that a seamless service is provided for the people whom we are discussing.</span></p>
<p>11.15am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind members of the Committee that if the word "you" is used, it refers to me, and I have never been invited to take part in the discussions of the joint care planning team.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. You have chaired with distinction several other Committees of which I was a member, and I am pleased to see you here.<br><br>
I am disappointed by the Minister's response. Members of the profession will consider that it did not do justice to the amendments. The hon. Gentleman's central theme was that there is no need for additional legislation, merely guidance and advice about good practice. In the early 1980s, I read reports of similar debates when the same line was taken. Eventually, the Government were embarrassed into introducing the 1984 Act because of problems and regular scandals. I hope that the Minister realises that such a process could happen again. Our points are valid and entirely reasonable.<br><br>
The guidance to which the Minister refers is hit-and-miss. If he talks to organisations in the private, public or voluntary sectors, he will find that they are aware of only some guidance documents. Only yesterday, I met a national organisation that deals with people who have learning difficulties and disabilities. I have the highest regard for that organisation; it provides voluntary homes and care-and-cluster schemes. It admitted that it had become
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
aware only recently of the document entitled "Homes Are For Living In", and that it had not before been drawn to the organisation's attention. The fact that guidance does not reach such organisations is evidence that the process does not work. We must consider what is offered in law.<br><br>
The extent of concern about security in residential care, privacy or restraint on rights, and medical and nursing needs shows that much stronger action is needed. With the greatest respect, the Minister has been somewhat complacent by underestimating concern outside the House about such issues.<br><br>
The Minister said that legislation would fetter local authorities. I take issue with that, because I doubt whether he has any evidence to prove it. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. Having met inspection and registration officers, I am aware that they are struggling to make some issues stick, simply because they are not written into law. Therefore, time and again, issues are raised at tribunals that should not have been raised. It should be clear in law exactly what powers officers have.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to talk to local authorities and to inspection and registration officers. Those officers have recently formed a national association, and it would be useful for him to meet them and to listen to the points at local level that their organisation in Yorkshire has put to me. Will he also study the reports of tribunals and consider the manner in which difficulties have arisen? The law is not clear on some of the issues that are raised by the amendments. Such issues have come before tribunals for a ruling, but the tribunals are unsure about what to do because the law is unclear.<br><br>
Local authorities would welcome clear legal powers. Furthermore, people in the private sector would welcome further clarity in the law, because they often face different interpretations of it from different authorities on a wide range of issues. That is unacceptable.<br><br>
I gained the impression from the Minister that, after April next year, the contracting clauses will be a mechanism whereby some of the issues can be written into contracts, when clear requirements can be made. I should welcome his expanding on that point. As I said on Tuesday, I am aware of concerns within the private and voluntary sectors about the nature of some of those contracts. Some worries are valid, but some are not.<br><br>
A major worry which has received press coverage is that some authorities insist on having the financial details of private care homes. That is entirely reasonable. I have come across people in care homes that subsequently went out of business, leaving those people without a home. Local authorities are quite right. A written answer that I received from the Minister gave me the impression that the Government were not unhappy about that practice. I would welcome the Minister's clarification on whether the contracting process will be used in that way. If so, will he outline thesteps that he has taken to inform local authorities, local authority associations and all providers of the Government's policy of such issues to be written into contracts?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
The Minister went on to say that the amendments would introduce what he termed a two-tier system. The two-tier system that he describes is what the Government chose to have. The system that we are discussing is the Government's two-tier system, the nonsense of which was recognised by my hon. Friends who served on the Standing Committee that considered the 1990 Bill.<br><br>
The Registered Homes Act 1984 applies only to care and nursing homes in the independent sector. I do not like use of the word "independent", because many such homes are totally dependent on state subsidies. I prefer to use the words "private" or "voluntary". The new inspection units do not require the registration of local authority homes, so, although units can specify requirements for registration of private and voluntary homes, that does not apply to the inspection process of local authority homes. If I am wrong, the Minister may intervene and contradict me; his officials are here to advise him. However, if he means that our amendments will introduce a two-tier system, I must tell him that we are dealing with the Government's two-tier system. It is their intention and policy to create a two-tier system.<br><br>
As someone with a local authority background, I would welcome inspection of registration within the public sector. I am sure that my hon. Friends would agree with me on that point. The Labour party's position is quite clear. It is the Government who are turning a blind eye to examples of bad practice in the public sector. They should do something about it, which would be widely welcomed.<br><br>
The two-tier system is nonsense, because the Bill does not apply to private or voluntary homes that are registered under the 1984 Act; nor does it apply to local authority accommodation. It applies to accommodation arranged by local authorities rather than to directly provided part III accommodation. The amendments described by the Minister as creating two tiers deal with the limited provisions arranged under the Bill. If they discriminate, as the Minister said, it is because the Bill itself discriminates. It could be argued that they discriminate, first, in favour of local authority establishments, and, secondly, in favour of establishments registered under the 1984 Act—the private and voluntary establishments that I have described. It is the nature of the Bill, not the intent of the amendments.<br><br>
On the pensions issue, the Minister is unaware of common practice. I urge him to listen to what is happening and to look at how we institutionalise people in the public, private and voluntary sectors. It is common practice for pension books to be taken when people first arrive at care homes. That is wrong, and we should do something about it. It is nonsense for the Minister to turn a blind eye to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A public meeting was called in my constituency some months ago—before I was elected. The meeting was devoted to a certain unregistered home which took people with learning difficulties. The social services department had decided that the practice in that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
home was not such that it could use the home, but people were still being sent there by the health service. The allegations made by the public were specifically on that issue. As well as commenting on the behaviour of those in the home and their effect on neighbours, the allegations were that the people who went into the home had their payment books removed and that the entire sum due from the Department of Social Security was collected by those who ran and owned the home. The people staying there saw no money except that allowed to them as pocket money. We should protect people from that practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. He is implying that there were suggestions about how the money was being used. I do not know the details and I am not suggesting that there is widespread misuse of pension money, but it happens in certain circumstances. The central point is that that practice institutionalises people because it removes their financial independence when they go into care.<br><br>
We need to consider other aspects of the problem. During the general election, certain care homes in my constituency displayed election posters. Surprise, surprise: they were Conservative party posters. I do not mind people displaying election posters, but they were in two private care homes in the Horbury area, and I resented not only that they were posters for my opponent but the implication that people in the home also supported that candidate. I know for a fact, because I know some of the people, that they did not. That happens not only in my constituency but here, there and everywhere.<br><br>
If I stuck Labour posters on the outside of the Minister's house how would he feel about it? That institutional practice is profoundly wrong and should be examined. I hope that homes take note of my comments—I shall certainly ensure that they are aware of them—and that it does not happen again. I would make the same point, quite sincerely, if they had displayed Labour posters and some of the residents were not Labour supporters. It is wrong in practice and in principle. We need to examine those institutional issues, and the amendments reflect that.<br><br>
I genuinely welcome the Minister's commitment to review "Home Life". That will be widely welcomed outside the House, but I must put that welcome in context. He said that standards of residential care are extremely high. I concede that there are examples of excellent practice in the private, public and voluntary sectors, but I have also seen some terrible examples in all three sectors. To make the general comment that standards are extremely high raises serious doubts about whether the Minister and the Department are aware of what is happening.<br><br>
I suggest that the Minister seeks reports from the registration and inspection officers and considers some of the problems with which they are dealing. I am aware of the sub judice regulations, but we should examine some of the cases that have been heard in the civil and criminal courts involving care homes. In particular, I draw the Minister's attention to the proceedings of the registered homes tribunal. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
Minister should suggest to his PPS that he may usefully occupy himself by tripping down to the Oriel Room in the Library and getting hold of deposit box 14, which is approximately a foot deep in reports from registered homes tribunals involving cases of what can only be described as appalling practice. It is worrying that, in some cases where the objective view is that homes are being run in an appalling way, appeals have been upheld but those homes have been allowed to continue.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr said, we will divide the Committee on amendment No. 21. That amendment covers virtually all the points that we have made. If Conservative Members vote against amendment No. 21, they will be voting against their own policy. They should put their money where their mouths are. The time has come for them to stick their hands up and show that they believe what they say in their documents. Our points are in Government documents and guidelines. They should be written into law to show that we believe in them; not that they look good in consultation documents. I urge the Minister to rethink and accede to amendment No. 21 at least.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make many points, but because time is limited I shall make only one, which relates to the reference in amendment No. 21 to freedom of choice. That is a key factor, because an establishment that provides choice puts residents and their quality of life—not necessarily their quality of care, although that is also important—above the needs of the home or the staff.<br><br>
Three years ago, I carried out a study for a social services authority and two health authorities that involved interviewing 1,300 residents in establishments ranging from NHS long-stay wards, at one extreme, to sheltered housing schemes at the other. Among other matters, we discussed with residents the flexibility and freedom of choice provided by the institutions in which they were living. We found that regimes varied enormously and that in the homes providing more choice, a greater proportion of the residents made choices so that there was a build-up effect. The residents who exercised choice over what they ate, when they got up, when they went to bed, where they went on outings and so on, were the residents who valued that choice most. So, perhaps more than anything else, freedom of choice is a trigger to improving the quality of life.<br><br>
Discussions about freedom of choice are an ideological matter. The Conservatives believe that free market forces are the best guarantor of freedom of choice, yet that is not so in the field of community care. Once a decision has been made to move to a home, a sheltered housing scheme or an Abbeyfield scheme, it is usually irrevocable. Only in extreme cases—normally only when the resident has a family or advocate to act on his behalf—can a resident move to another home. The freedom of choice provided in homes must be regulated; that is the role of the regulation authorities.<br><br>
At the end of Tuesday's sitting, the Minister argued against the group of amendments, on the grounds
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
that the Government had established conditions for some care establishments that would not apply to all of them. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Particular requirements would be placed by law"—</p></blockquote>
by the amendments—
<br><blockquote><p>"on some homes … but not on others, which might, in all other respects, be entirely similar." [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E.</i> 16 June 1992; c. 32.]</p></blockquote>
I would like the Minister to consider two arguments, which should make him change his view. First, if residents' rights—to privacy, freedom of choice and individuality—need to be established, then, as legislators, we should legislate to establish them. Secondly, the rules should differ according to differing types and classes of establishment.<br><br>
The findings of the study that I mentioned earlier showed that the degree of freedom of choice available varied hugely from one class of home to another. That is what you would expect, because freedom of choice depends on the attitudes of the staff and the regime in a home and on the level of dependency of the individual residents. The frailer you are, the less able you are to exercise freedoms. The class of establishments with which the Bill deals are those in which the dependency of residents is likely to be lower than in residential care homes, nursing homes or NHS long-stay wards. The opportunity for those running the homes to provide wide freedom of choice is therefore greater. The amendment recognises that circumstances differ and it should therefore be accepted. It is easier for staff to provide such guarantees to residents in the class of establishments covered by the Bill than in some other establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The same admonition applies to the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) as to the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes). If the word "you" is used, it refer to me. I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member's speech as I understand how difficult it is for new Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two points that I want to make which I hope that the Minister will consider. The first relates to complaints procedure. As he is aware, there is guidance, rather than regulations, on complaints procedure. That means that in nursing homes there does not have to be an internal complaints procedure. There need only be guidance on complaints to the health authority about the home. I suggest that that can lead to extremely unsatisfactory situations.<br><br>
Recently I had to investigate a complaint by a patient in a nursing home who had complained to nursing staff there, but the complaint had not been considered. When I complained to the health authority, which has an inspectorate duty, I was informed that there was no complaints procedure even for the health authority to investigate. That merits serious consideration.<br><br>
I understand what the Minister said and that he prefers guidance to regulations. However, one can be sure that local authorities and health authorities implement regulations, whereas the implementation of guidance can be variable. If the Minister is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
unwilling to consider regulations governing complaints, will he examine carefully the guidance issued for the regulations and investigation of complaints?<br><br>
My second point concerns non-registered homes. The Minister said that he did not want to subject small homes to undue prescriptive legislation, and that if they were not providing a good service the local authority would not place people there, and vice versa. Logically, however, that could be applied to any home and there would be no need for any registration. The reason that homes must be registered is, presumably, to lay down basic standards of care. That is seen as an important part of the registration process. I suggest that it is an illogical argument that supply and demand should be left to the marketplace in the case of small homes, but that regulations should be introduced for larger homes.<br><br>
I suggest also that that leaves small homes in an impossible position. If a local authority deregisters a larger home, there is a complaints procedure whereby the owner of the home can complain to the local authority and appeal against deregistration. By leaving small homes unregistered, the Minister denies the owners of small homes the right of appeal against a local authority that might have decided, for reason right, wrong or indifferent, against future placements there. That could lead to possible abuse of small homes by the authorities. I urge the Minister to consider some form of protection for small homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perry Barr raised a serious point about continence services and I shall certainly study his report. I understand that there is concern about possible inconsistencies in the implementation of different health authority policies on this important subject. The principle is well established and strongly supported by the Government that people in residential care homes have the same general entitlement to national health service and community nursing services as people living in their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we move to the next amendment, let me explain how we shall deal with this, as there are many new hon.

After we have dealt with amendment No. 17, I shall ask the hon. Gentleman to move amendment No. 21 formally. That may save confusion later. Do you wish to withdraw amendment No 2, Mr. Hinchliffe.</span></p>

Amendment No. 3 deals with the important issue of advocacy and representation, which exist in some areas—an example of good practice—but do not in many residential homes. As we have heard in our proceedings, the absence of advocacy and representation is to the detriment of many elderly residents. The amendment seeks to put that right.<br><br>
We have established that elderly people are entitled to a say about the environment in which they live and the services which are, or are not, being provided. The absence of advocacy means that in too many cases, the choice to which my hon. Friend the Member for York and other hon. Members referred is being denied to elderly people, many of whom are disabled, have suffered from strokes or have hearing or sight impairments or speech difficulties. They are not able to express their choice and use their right to a say in the sort of services that are provided. Where advocacy and representation exist, there is every sign that it is best practice, which should be extended as far as possible.<br><br>
I did not interrupt the Minister earlier. We are dealing with an important matter and it would be helpful in the Minister were to give us a bit of a hearing. If he is not prepared to listen to me, God help the elderly people on whose behalf we are speaking and who need advocacy.<br><br>
The changes that were dealt with by the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, of which this Bill is a by-product, and which we have discussed this morning, show that we accept that the growing number of elderly people in our society means that society should prepare to respond. There is inevitable confusion because of the difficulties, such as disorientation, that many elderly people experience. Given the issues that have already, rightly, been raised, how can we be sure, in the absence of representation and advocacy as supported by the amendment and by many voluntary bodies, that issues such as pensions, pension books and the relationship between the individual and the social security system are being dealt with fairly, adequately and in the interest of the individual involved? Every elderly person we are considering is an individual who is entitled to be regarded as such. How can we be sure that their pension rights are being dealt with adequately if the facility for advocacy embraced by the amendment is not accepted far more widely than at present?<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Several of my hon. Friends have drawn the Committee's attention to important issues by citing anecdotal evidence of cases which could have been greatly improved had an advocate or representative been present. However, it was clear that none was provided. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
commented on that matter, and he would agree that the evidence from the registered homes tribunals suggests that, had advocates or representatives been present at many of those cases, some of those bad practices would not have been allowed to occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is clear from a study of the cases on file in the Library that tribunal cases frequently arise when there have been bad practices for a long time. They have not been dealt with in the way that he suggested they could had there been active involvement of advocacy or a system of reviewing in those homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have my hon. Friend's support, because he has enormous knowledge of those matters. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster. North referred to the problems caused because 47 per cent of nursing homes do not provide locks on bathroom or toilet doors. I cannot believe that representatives of elderly people would accept that, and why should they?<br><br>
One problem is that, in most instances, there is no one present to ask what is happening to an individual, why services are not provided in the way that they should, and why the lifestyle of elderly people is impeded. The amendment would improve matters, albeit in a limited way, because of the remit and restrictions of the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) talked about the inevitable loss of privacy of those who move into residential accommodation. He cited a compelling example of a client who was locked in her room overnight because the establishment was not sure that the person in charge on night duty would be able to deal with her. That is a specific example of a need for advocacy or representation. I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that, if it had been provided, that terrible experience, which, sadly, is not a one-off case, would not have occurred.<br><br>
I advise the Minister, with great respect, that it does not help if he tries to convey the impression that all Labour authorities are not good while all Tory authorities are good, and that the public sector leaves much to be desired while the private sector is splendid. The plain and simple truth is that there are examples of bad practice in each sector. They are intolerable and must be challenged wherever they exist. If representation and advocacy helps in that regard, so be it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell) spoke about the worries of directors of social services. They have an important view and their work does not give much job satisfaction at present because of the pressures that they face. My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr stated that the constraints and strains on social workers are immense. My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich quoted a director of social services as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It's not the children at risk who keep us awake at night, it is what might be happening to elderly people in residential care in the local authority's own homes and to the thousands of elderly residents who are cared for, often a long way from home, in private residential and nursing homes."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E.</i> 16 June 1992; c.26.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
My hon Friend the Member for Dulwich would agree that, in many of those cases, about which directors of social services are extremely worried, representation and advocacy would be of considerable assistance. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) gave the example of an elderly disabled lady who was about to be evicted from a nursing home. That lady, who would obviously be experiencing considerable difficulty, might not, in the absence of a representative or an advocate, be able to defend her interests. It would be unacceptable to ask her to do so. Many decisions of that nature are being taken, but we hear little about them. Some cases may reach the ears of hon. Members. However, elderly people may not have a family, or, for various reasons, the family may not be able to become involved in the elderly person's problems. That does not mean that the House of Commons has the right to leave the problem alone. Elderly people, who are quite manifestly unable to cope, should not be left to try to look after their own interests.<br><br>
I am sure that other hon. Members like me, are often asked what the precise role of an advocate is. What does representation mean? The <i>Health Service Journal</i> of 29 August 1991 has been helpful in our discussion of the amendment. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"'The chance to make our own decisions: not having decisions made for you' is fundamental to the concept of advocacy and empowerment."</p></blockquote>
The chance to have a representative to speak on behalf of a person who is unable to do so—either temporarily or permanently—is central to any strategy towards community care. An explanation of the amendment is contained in the advocacy report:
<br><blockquote><p>"The main starting point for user empowerment is the growing recognition that services have trained people into being passive, disabled receivers of 'help', and have thus often left them less able to cope with their lives, and to feel self-respect, than they did before they became service users."</p></blockquote>
It is tragic that people who visit private or public sector homes should think that an elderly person who has a roof above his head, and a bed, food and a television set in the corner is receiving adequate care. That is not the case at all. To leave elderly people in that situation is the opposite of what care in the community should be. There are some excellent examples of best practice. Recently I visited a home in France for, as they say there, the third age. Instead of waiting to be entertained or for people to talk to them, the elderly people there thought that we, as visitors, were their guests and they entertained us because we were visiting their home. They felt that they were still living a useful and productive life, which is preferable to finding elderly people in homes sitting in front of a television set, where the atmosphere makes no sense at all.<br><br>
The absence of advocacy and representation has led to too many examples of that kind. I shall give another example of effective care for elderly and disabled people. It comes, Mr. McWilliam, from your beloved—and native—city of Edinburgh. The Edinvar project, which is encouraged by Edinburgh district council and Edinburgh university, is a splendid community care project. People with disabilities—many of them elderly—and non-disabled people live together in the same complex
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
and help each other. I found that extremely satisfactory and a splendid example of best practice.<br><br>
I am not in any way reflecting upon the medical profession. However, I spoke to two elderly ladies who had spent many years in an old-fashioned Victorian psychiatric hospital. Eventually, after a number of years and proper assessments, they were given an opportunity to live fairly independently in the little community at Edinvar.<br><br>
I recall one of the ladies telling me that she was very happy at the change from her previous lifestyle in a psychiatric hospital, which she compared with the community care project. I asked her, "What do you think is the main advantage? What pleases you most about the way that you live now?" She answered, "They dinna gie ye jags." I must call on the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) for a translation. What the lady meant is that they do not give injections.<br><br>
I am not reflecting in any way on psychiatric hospitals or any other sector of the profession. However, where medicine—injection or tranquillisers—is administered, it is fair and reasonable that a representative or advocate should be present to ask why that is happening and why such treatment is being given. In most cases, they may agree that it is in the interest of the residents but, in the absence of advocacy and representation, many questions are being asked. Rightly, that leads to the suggestion that more care and thought be given to whether it is necessarily in the patients' best interests to administer such medicine. None of us would accept medicine day after day without asking what it was for or why it was being done.<br><br>
If the advocates' role means, as it does, that there is concern about services at every level—social services departments, social work in Scotland, the national health service, the Department of Social Security, housing departments and so on—it is not unreasonable that it should give the representative or advocate the right to ask the type of questions that I have mentioned. These are supported by voluntary organisations such as Citizen Advocacy Alliance and Age Concern.<br><br>
Advocacy is important because views and needs will genuinely be considered. Services related to mental illness cannot be delivered unless we are sure that the right of each important individual is taken into account. That is an important aspect for residential patients who may have had mental illnesses but are on the way to recovery. Until we are sure that their extremely crucial rights as individuals have been taken on board, we cannot be sure that the services that the Bill provides are being properly administered. If they are not given an opportunity for advocacy and representation and the chance to make the decisions, they will be left powerless and the status quo will continue.<br><br>
Our amendment embraces a long-held view of many voluntary organisations. I, too, accept that there is some resistance to advocacy and to representation as we understand it. An excellent paper entitled "Advocacy Report" by Ann Bardsley has been published by the Scottish Association for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
Mental Health. It reveals that there is resistance to advocacy from the nursing profession. Some nurses regard themselves as advocates, which is against the spirit of true advocacy and representation. In the section of that report which deals with barriers to advocacy, Ann Bardsley says:
<br><blockquote><p>"'I am already advocating for my patients'. This statement was echoed in nearly every hospital and nursing college the project visited, and represents one of the main barriers to the development of genuine advocacy.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Many of the statutory workers felt that they knew best what was in their patient's best interest. Some felt that giving patients a choice would mean that they could not get on with the daily routine—'giving a demented geriatric a simple choice of what to wear could take hours', was one remark. They don't understand anyway', was another. 'They can't make decisions for themselves anyway, so who else is there to advocate for them?' was another. Many nursing staff felt that by passing on information requested by patients to a consultant or doctor was advocating. In some it may be, but in most it is carrying out their jobs."</p></blockquote>
12 noon<br><br>
We have some excellent examples there of what advocacy is not about and, by implication, what representation and advocacy is about. It is about accepting that, more than anything else, the role, views and feelings of individuals—even those who cannot express themselves in any way—are nevertheless crucial in delivering community care, in particular in residential homes.<br><br>
Although the main legislation, the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, and this Bill do not make a feature of it, the House of Commons and another place have always firmly embraced the principle of advocacy, which was shown when they endorsed the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. Therefore, without attempting to be too modest, I am trying to persuade the Committee—something of which I am not often accused—that provisions for this should rightly be made in the legislation. For the most part, the debate has been non-controversial. The Minister—despite a false start when he tried to be political when most people were not—could enhance his reputation if he embraced the important principle of advocacy and accepted that that it what the House of Commons wants, because of its endorsement of the 1986 Act.<br><br>
The 1986 Act set up a system whereby representatives of a disabled person could deal with, for example, the social services department on a pensions matter. The Government said earlier this year that they had "postponed indefinitely" the implementation of the relevant sections of the Act, which would have brought this scheme into effect. They argued that their community care proposals adequately covered those matters.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield and for Cardiff, South and Penarth served with me on the Standing Committee that considered the National Health Service and Community Care Bill in 1990. We know that the question of advocacy was virtually unmentioned. It is nonsense for the Government to argue that because the 1990 Act transcends it, there is no need to deal with the important provisions of the 1986 Act which cover advocacy and representation. When the present Secretary of State for Health was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
in Committee dealing with those matters, we knew that she was not addressing advocacy and representation as we understand it under the terms of the 1986 Act.<br><br>
We had doubts in Committee. However, some of us went on a delegation, led by Jack Ashley, to discuss with the present Secretary of State for Health advocacy and representation in terms of the 1986 Act. We were joined by some splendid people from RADAR—the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation—and Mencap, including Lord Rix. It was clear at that time—less than a year ago—that the right hon. Lady did not understand precisely what we meant by advocacy and representation in community care, especially in relation to the great problems of the elderly.<br><br>
The amendment would introduce a progressive element into the legislation. It is widely supported. As far as I am aware, there is virtually no voluntary organisation involved in these matters that does not embrace and support advocacy and representation. The organisations hold that view because they know that the quality of life of our elderly people leaves much to be desired. The growing number of elderly people and the problem of demography—which, I concede, any Government would have to face—make it all the more compelling for those people's rights to be taken into account. The plain and simple fact is that even this Bill, if enacted, cannot be effective if the Government still deny genuine and meaningful advocacy. For that reason, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to follow the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke). As a new Member of Parliament who has spent much of my life working in community care, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend, who has been a real beacon of light. He has campaigned tirelessly in the House on behalf of disabled people. It is a blot on the Government's record—one of many—that they have not seen fit to implement, in the interests of disabled people, those parts of the legislation pioneered by my hon. Friend that are still outstanding.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend rightly said, the means of implementing what the amendment proposes is already on the statute book. What prevents its implementation is the Government's strange perversity in refusing to accept the self-evident value of a formal system of advocacy: access by the elderly and, indeed, disabled people, as the legislation makes clear, to an authorised representative, an advocate, to act on their behalf.<br><br>
Perhaps I may reiterate what we have all come to understand as some of the policy objectives of the broader legislation, of which this measure forms such an important part. It will advance the empowerment of elderly and disabled people and their carers. It is recognition of the fact that being disabled, elderly and reliant upon public, private or voluntary sector services may rob people of the power that they might have as fully autonomous individuals.<br><br>
This legislation is intended to redress some of those factors. It also involves giving people more control
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
over their lives and redressing the dreadful imbalance whereby people who use community care services so often feel themselves to be without choice and powerless in negotiations about what they receive and the terms under which they receive it. One reason why the Bill has attracted such extensive bipartisan support is that it will redress that imbalance.<br><br>
The Bill will also improve the quality of support for carers, which is a source of poignant concern to many of us. Next week London Members will be taking part in London Carers Week, which we hope will provide yet another opportunity to highlight the messages that too often fall on unhearing ears about the loneliness, stress, poverty and physical strain that carers often face. Caring is a job that we all, at some time, may expect to do or to benefit from. The major providers of community care do the job invisibly and largely without complaint. The Bill is intended to do something to improve the quality of support for carers.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to hear the point that I am about to make. Our debate on this amendment will be regarded by many people outside—the providers of services, the recipients, and the carers—as one about the way in which the Government intend those broad statements of policy to be achieved in practice. No one would dispute that advocacy—representation—is a very important step towards empowering people in circumstances in which they may otherwise be vulnerable. It is an important step in giving people more control over their lives at a time when they, by dint of circumstances in residential care, are extremely vulnerable.<br><br>
I should like to focus my comments specifically on elderly people who are particularly vulnerable. As we considered earlier, by the time that people are admitted to residential care, many are confused and unable to care for themselves at home. In a sense, their physical and mental state makes them vulnerable. They are also vulnerable because they are not in their own home; they are living in places where they have no security of tenure. Because the Government rejected the previous group of amendments, elderly people are denied certainties about privacy. We must seek to rectify the important problem of vulnerability in specific and practical ways.<br><br>
Another point, which I hope is beyond dispute, is that there may be a conflict of interest between those who provide residential care and the elderly people who are the consumers of that care. There may be ways of running a home which are convenient for the home's owners, managers and care staff but which are at variance with the objectives of empowerment, dignity and choice over the way in which daily routines are conducted. It is in seeking to deal directly with that conflict of interest that advocacy has such an important role.<br><br>
Advocacy has been the subject of much loose talk in recent years. The definition that I like best is offered by John O'Brien, one of the American pioneers of citizen advocacy. He describes it as the process whereby one individual represents the interests of another as if they were his or her own.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Advocacy combines a series of functions which address directly the condition of people living in residential care. It covers the need for companionship and the fact that there may be a conflict of interest—hence the importance of advocacy as a partisan relationship on behalf of the elderly person; it should be a relationship that is undertaken fully and freely on an entirely voluntary basis. As a result of working with people with learning difficulties, John O'Brien argued strongly against advocates being paid, although that has been an emerging trend. He also argued strongly for voluntary ethics, a view to which I subscribe.<br><br>
Advocacy takes many forms. I want to talk briefly about citizen advocacy, which is especially appropriate in these circumstances. That is representation by a person who is not disabled, in the interests of a person who has some experience of disability. Before I was elected to the House, I was involved in establishing in Birmingham a citizen advocacy scheme for people with long-term and recurrent mental illness. Advocates were recruited from the local area specifically to support people discharged from mental hospitals, who were making the difficult transition from life in an institution to life outside.<br><br>
If the period of transition does not go well, people are often catapulted back into hospital—they simply break down because they cannot cope not only with the rigours but the relatively moderate demands of daily life. It is hardly surprising that if for 30 years, one has not cooked one's meals or been responsible for maintaining one's own clothing, it is bewildering to have to do so. Such people may have to negotiate their own benefits, even though decimal coinage may not have been in currency before they were in care. Citizen advocacy has been proved to play an important part in making such transition easier.<br><br>
The advocates who were recruited were not paid, but a heavy investment was made in the support and training. It was a small and limited scheme, and was supported for as long as funds were available, but it was of enormous benefit to the recipients—the people who had been discharged from hospital. The evaluation of the scheme bore out the fact that it provided valuable experience for the recipients. Advocacy covers citizen advocacy and self advocacy, which has been developed extensively for people with learning difficulties. We can also look at more formal forms of legal advocacy. We should not introduce a discordant, adversarial note into the way in which negotiation between the user and the provider is conducted. The amendment is intended specifically to redress what any of us would regard as a likely imbalance of power, and to redress the well-recognised conflict of interest between those who provide services and those who use them.<br><br>
There may not, for all sorts of reasons, be an absolute coincidence of interests. Advocacy does not redress the imbalance on its own; it is but one measure that can at least pull back some of the undertow. It can act as a counterweight to the tendency for decisions to gravitate towards the interests of providers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
I hope that the Minister will say whether he accepts that such a conflict of interest may arise. If he does not accept the amendment, will he explain what other steps he will take to ensure that that conflict of interest is redressed in the interests of vulnerable elderly people in residential care? That must be done in a way that would be accepted by the huge body of opinion outside the House as being more effective than citizen advocacy. Forms of advocacy are badly needed and, if they are not introduced and made available on a fairly extensive basis, the spirit of the Bill and the achievement of its desirable practical measures will be in jeopardy.<br><br>
Who should be advocates—carers, care managers or social workers? The role of an advocate is a function that is outside any responsibility for the provision and delivery of services. It has been argued that, in some circumstances, care managers can act as advocates. That conflicts with the voluntary principle. If the care manager is working for the authority that is also providing the care, it is an unsustainable conflict of interest.<br><br>
Advocates should be recruited from the broader community, from those who may have been carers or who wish to devote their time to such a cause. Thought should be given to developing a team of advocates throughout the country, which could be freely available to support the interests of individual elderly residents. It is important that the relationship should combine the capacity to act in an informed and informal way when making representations, with the functions of companionship and friendship. An advocate should have the capacity to function alongside elderly people and to understand their needs, preferences, and the texture of their daily lives. Understanding the little details of the daily lives of elderly people can make the difference between their lives being worth living and their just subsisting.<br><br>
I was a member of the Mental Health Act Commission for seven years, and I visited people in special hospitals. I was responsible for visiting Broadmoor, and I was particularly struck by the range of issues that we were asked to take up with the hospital management on behalf of the detainees. The issues ranged—at the weightier end—from the devastating effects of drugs that were administered, whether people had given their full consent to be given certain drugs and the breach of civil rights, to whether people were receiving the daily newspaper that they had asked for, whether they were getting enough fresh milk and whether the food was to their liking and preference.<br><br>
Because we take such matters for granted, we assume that elderly people in residential care also take them for granted, but we know that they cannot. Advocacy is very important for people who are very confused and with whom the staff may not have time to have lengthy discussions to discover individual preferences. It also has an important job in highlighting the ordinary aspects of the preferences of daily life. It has an equally important job in monitoring some of the graver breaches that may take place.<br><br>
For example, in some residential homes, it is more convenient to get repeat prescriptions for elderly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
people rather than to review the level at which medication needs to be set. Advocacy also has a part to play in asking some pretty hard questions if the elderly person's pension is taken away. It means to act on behalf of and in the interests of elderly people, and is an expression of the aspirations for the best standard of services for elderly people held by the community as a whole and in the spirit of the legislation.<br><br>
One of the most important contributions that the free flow of advocates through the doors of residential homes can make is the presence of the outside world. We know that institutions can become closed to the influences of the outside world. It is when that happens that some of the dreadful scandals and outrages to personal dignity that shock us when we read about them can occur. If contact is maintained with the standards and expectations of the world outside, that is an extremely important contribution that the widespread activity of advocates can make.<br><br>
Advocacy is important also because many elderly people are placed in residential care homes or nursing homes a long way from home. On Second Reading, I spoke about a project in my consitituency, run under the auspices of Age Concern in Southwark, which provides a visiting and representation service to elderly people who are placed in nursing homes some way from Southwark. For many of those elderly people, that is the only link that they have with the place that they came from. Advocacy is a way of maintaining that link. For many elderly people, admission to residential homes results in—there is systematic research evidence to support the view—a lessening of bonds and sometimes the end of contact with their families. A way of making good that deficit needs to be found, and advocacy has an important contribution to make.<br><br>
I defy the Government not to accept the amendment. Everyone accepts that well-supported, directed and trained advocates enhance the quality of care available to elderly people. Every informed voluntary organisation representing the interests of elderly people—for example, the Alzheimer's Disease Society, Age Concern and others—support the value of advocacy for elderly people. The world will receive the Government's rejections of the amendment with bewilderment at best and, at worst, rejection would cast severe doubt on the Government's integrity in meeting the spirit of legislation that many of us have been pleased to support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Wakefield. I should say that I did not wish to interrupt the hon. Lady's interesting speech, but she comes under the same admonition as her hon. Friends the Members for Doncaster, North and for York. If there is any residual doubt in the Committee. I have cooked my meals for the past 30 years, on and off, and, indeed, have had no choice for the past 12 months.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great honour to follow two such first-class contributions as those made by my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
hon. Friends the Members for Monklands, West and for Dulwich. It is sad that Conservative Members have not made similar contributions on an issue that, as I know from talking to them, concerns some of them. Apart from the Minister, all that we had from those who sit on the Government Benches was one loud sneeze from the hon. Member for Gillingham. That is unacceptable. I hope that we shall have some contributions from them later.<br><br>
Two Acts, sponsored by the Government, that were passed more or less alongside one another are inconsistent. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West, who distinguished himself on the Front Bench, served on the Committee that considered the Children Act 1989. The right hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), the Secretary of State for National Heritage, was the Minister. To his great credit, he established a consensus on the Committee that welcomed contributions from all sides. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West will recall, on one occasion the Committee adjourned and sat informally with civil servants from the Department of Health to reach consensus on a clause that dealt with assessment. For that, I commend the right hon. and learned Member for Putney, who is in my good books at the moment. He is a convert to rugby league football after his first match at Wembley in early May. The Minister should take note of the practices of some of his predecessors.<br><br>
There are inconsistencies between the Children Act 1989 and the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 in respect of advocacy. The two Bills were considered at roughly the same time. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West served on the Committees consecutively.<br><br>
The Children Act 1989 makes clear statutory provision for assessment through the assessment orders procedure, for regular reviews of the progress and circumstances of individual children and for an independent advocacy procedure through the guardian ad litem process. As far as I am aware, that procedure works reasonably well. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich about non-professionals being involved, but that procedure allows some independent, objective monitoring of vulnerable individuals in care.<br><br>
The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, in which the lacuna that we are trying to correct by means of the Bill occurred, established an assessment procedure, though I have doubts about whether it will be effectively implemented. The Act provides for case management procedures, but none for reassessment or review, on the lines of those in the Children Act 1989. Amendment No. 35 makes noises about review, but the legislation is inconsistent. There is no provision for independent advocacy in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.<br><br>
The Government line in Standing Committee—my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West is right—was that they had not implemented the 1986 Act because it was overtaken by the provisions of the 1990 Act. That is nonsense, as my two hon. Friends
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
have made clear. There is nothing in that legislation relating to independent advocacy, which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West moved amendment No. 3. If there is to be consistency in the legislation, the Government will accept the amendment.<br><br>
Thousands of vulnerable people are being placed in care and, frankly, left and forgotten. That aint on. That is not right, and no member of the Committee would subscribe to it. That practice is gradually being exposed, and there are ways and means of assisting the process of changing that appalling human rights situation. Unless such people cause trouble to the establishments concerned, whether public or private, there they remain. If they have no relatives or friends and there is no one to assist, befriend and support them, hard lines. They are simply forgotten. They have no voice in society, so does it really matter? The Opposition believe, as I hope Conservative Members also believe, that it does matter and that we should do something about it.<br><br>
Under the Bill, unless there is some statutory arrangement—for example, if a person is placed in an establishment, as presumably he could be, under a guardianship arrangement with a local authority—there is no supervision, review, re-assessment or advocacy. On Second Reading, I said that, in comparison with the rest of Europe, Britain's record on institutionalising people is wrong—"scandalous" is the term that I used. We institutionalise far too many people. We should consider why people end up in that situation, and we should examine the system that we have adopted.<br><br>
When people are removed from their own homes and end up in institutional care, there should be regular checks. The Minister agreed, although he was concerned about the formalities that would be included in legislation if our amendments were accepted. I hope that he will consider the review procedures with which amendment No. 35 deals.<br><br>
We need a system of independent advocacy, as my hon. Friends have described in detail. That would enable a person automatically to have access to outside support when necessary, not simply by accident if he or she happens to meet somebody in passing who comes into a home and sees something that is wrong. There should be an automatic system and an objective overview of the person's circumstances in a home or other establishment.<br><br>
The existing arrangements are grossly inadequate and something must be done about them. Inspection and registration officers are not able to undertake that role. They may on occasion pick up from individual residents issues that are of concern, but it is not their role to undertake evaluation or advocacy for individuals in establishments. They do not have the time to do that, and it is not their function in law.<br><br>
The Bill deals with unregistered establishments where there would probably be no contact with inspection and registration officers. Will the Minister tell me what residents could do, after the Bill is enacted, if they were dissatisfied with the treatment that they were receiving in a residential home and they did not have access to complaints procedures
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
or formal means of dealing with their problems? What objective monitoring will there be of a resident's situation if, for example, he or she cannot talk or is unable to communicate? As my hon. Friends have observed, there are people who cannot write a letter or speak. They are extremely vulnerable and disadvantaged. I hope that the Minister will accept that some form of independent representation is essential in such situations, and I hope that he will accept my hon. Friend's excellent amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West, who moved the amendment, is well known for being both interested and expert in this matter. I shall many of the concerns that he expressed. I am grateful to him for not reminding the Committee that I was, I believe, one of the sponsors of his 1986 Act. I am glad that he did not use that against me during the debate. The consequence of my sponsorship was that I remained on the Back Benches for a further four and a half years.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government have no intention of denying anyone access to advocacy in the forms that he described. I take the opportunity to confirm that the Government recognise the crucial role that advocacy can play in ensuring for a variety of people, who may find it difficult to speak for themselves, the outcome that we wish our community care policy to achieve. There is not difference between the hon. Gentleman and me on concern or objectives.<br><br>
I refer again to the code of practice "Home Life" which recommends that residents should have access to advocacy. Paragraph 1.2.3 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Some residents—many of them very vulnerable people—will need help to express their wishes and preferences. All residents should have access to external advice, representation and, possibly, advocacy. Even deeply held views and aspirations may not be expressed if staff do not encourage such links outside the home."</p></blockquote>
That is pretty clear, but I shall go further and say that, when we review "Home Life", if, in the light of what has been said this morning and of other views that may be expressed, it seems helpful to strengthen that commitment to the availability of advocacy, we shall consider including a stronger statement.<br><br>
In addition to what is contained in that code of practice, our new arrangements for community care place particular importance on involving users and carers. When someone enters residential care for the first time, the carer, who may be a family member, is likely to act also as an advocate.<br><br>
Section 46 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 requires local authorities to consult representatives of users and their carers when they draw up community care plans. Paragraph 3.16 of our policy guidance, "Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond", also makes it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>"individual users and their carers should be involved throughout the assessment and care management process"</p></blockquote>
and that
<br><blockquote><p>"they should feel that the process is aimed at meeting their wishes."</p></blockquote>
That point is stressed throughout the guidance. Paragraph 5.25 of the practice guidance, "Care Management and Assessment" states that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The new arrangements for care management and assessment are designed to create a more equal relationship between practitioners and users—carers, with maximum participation by the latter. Procedure and practice will have to be amended to ensure that the needs, views and preferences of users are placed first and that the role of and contribution of carers receive greater attention."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Wakefield referred again to complaints. Since introducing the new complaints procedure in April last year, users and carers—perhaps acting in the role of advocates—may complain to the local authority concerned if they are dissatisfied with the services provided. That route is available to anyone who is placed in any form of accommodation by a local authority.<br><br>
The debate provides the opportunity to emphasise that the Government wish to encourage local authorities to develop local advocacy schemes in a way that is designed to meet the specific needs of local people. That is a better way forward than that offered by the amendment, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a positive response to our comments, but he did not justify making such a response and falling short of accepting the amendment. I was glad to hear that he was a sponsor of the Act that was introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West. I understand that, under the regime of 1986, it was a bold move and that it cost the Minister enhancement at the time. However, senior Conservatives have emphasised that that sort of regime no longer pertains, and I am sure that if the amendment were accepted it would not lead to his swift removal from his position.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister says that the amendment is unnecessary because the Government have already shown their commitment to advocacy in their policy guidance and because he is encouraging local authorities to engage in their own advocacy schemes. However, he falls short of suggesting that the amendment be agreed to.<br><br>
We are not dealing with people who are admitted only to local authority residential care, where it is relatively easy for an authority to set up advocacy practice on behalf of people who are affected. We are considering the issue of voluntary and private sector involvement. We are especially considering unregistered residential establishments. In those circumstances, we must have legislative safeguards, which would be more effective than simple policy guidance. I accept that there may be a certain level of commitment to advocacy, but there is a strong case for building that commitment into the Bill, rather than it being merely understood or just part of the documentation available to local authorities and social workers.<br><br>
The Minister is right on the nail with the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. He will have noted that approximately 46 hon. Members have signed early-day motion 227, which includes at the top the name of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) and which calls for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
the implementation of that Act so that the advocacy principle is embodied in effective law. My hon. Friends and I want that to take place. It is especially important for those with learning difficulties, for the physically handicapped who have communication problems, and for elderly people suffering from dementia. Those categories represent a considerable proportion of people in residential care. Staff should be available to acton those people's behalf.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich gave the Committee an excellent account. Her experience as mental health commissioner is especially valuable, and she made important points. However, I disagree with her on one issue. It is possible to have professional advocates. The authority to which I still belong employs professional advocates in the health sector, but they also do some work for people with learning difficulties. It is possible to have the job done on a professional basis, but I accept that, by and large, it will be done by carers, next of kin and others who feel responsible for residents. Whoever does it, it is a very important task.<br><br>
I shall cite an example that draws attention to the discrepancy which my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield mentioned between the tightly-drawn provisions of the Children Act—important provisions because the role of guardian ad litem can frequently be critical to what happens to children in care—and the unwillingness to legislate on this matter. A constituent of mine, aged about 40, recently left residential care. My dealings with him have come about as part of his efforts to secure for himself the documentation under which he was admitted to residential care at the age of 10.<br><br>
The man has a speech deficiency, which means that he was mistakenly thought to have learning difficulties. As a result, he was kept in residential care in a hospital setting for far longer than he should have been. In fact, he should never have been in residential care. Through the co-operation of the chairman of York health authority, I eventually managed to get for this constituent all the papers relating to his admission to, and retention in, residential care. Eventually it emerged that in the late 1950s, at the age of 9 or 10, he was found guilty of stealing milk. His parents felt that they could not handle him because of their social difficulties at the time, so he went into residential care. There, because of his speech difficulties, he stayed.<br><br>
Under current legislation, that could hardly happen now. Fortunately, there is legislation that would protect him at an early age, but we do not have the procedures that would easily have released him from residential care, once he became an adult. This person unnecessarily spent the greater part of his life—some 25 years—in residential care, and at great public expense.<br><br>
It is important that the advocacy process begins to work. I accept the Minister's strong sympathy for Opposition Members' arguments, but it is most important that we enshrine our amendment in legislation. I hope that he will think again and bear in mind that, if the amendment is accepted, it will not cost anyone his job.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, if only to facilitate a Division before one o'clock. I say that, because I found the Under-Secretary's response extremely disappointing.<br><br>
I am delighted that he reminded the Committee, as perhaps I should have done, that he was a sponsor of the 1986 Act. I was happy with his work at the time, but I am most worried about what has happened to him since.<br><br>
He is in good company. At the time, a young Whip promised me that there would be a timetable for implementation. Then the young Whip became the Minister for the Disabled. Again I was promised a timetable, but it did not happen. When the young Minister went on to be Chief Secretary to the Treasury I thought that surely we would get it this time, but again it did not happen. He then became Chancellor of the Exchequer. I thought. "It must be coming now" but it did not. Eventually he became Prime Minister, and still we do not have it. So when another young Minister tells me. "You will get it", I shall say "I am sorry, but on the basis of the record we must have more than that."<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich made an excellent speech. I thought that John O'Brien's definition of advocacy was superb. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield was right to refer to the Children Act 1989. I am sorry that the Government have not emulated the spirit that existed between Government and Opposition when that Act was passed. The right, hon. and learned Member for Putney, who was Minister at the time, had the decency to involve Conservative and Labour Members in all kinds of discussions. We went to his Department and met civil servants. He accepted amendment after amendment and many new clauses. There was a genuinely good spirit of consensus, which led to a better Act than there otherwise would have been. He did not say, as the Minister did today, "Do not press the amendment; we shall give you a code of practice." A code of practice is simply not good enough. The problems that my hon. Friends
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
discussed need more than a code of practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich, for instance, mentioned conflicts between carer and individual. Sometimes families want something for an elderly person that is not in his or her best interest. The person who can make the best contribution—which involves giving the views and rights of the elderly person—is the representative or advocate.<br><br>
I should have liked to say much more. I hope that my hon. Friends will support me in pressing the amendment to a Division. I hope also that some Conservative members of the Committee will not feel that their future progress will be barred if they support the amendment. The Under-Secretary, after all, might not have become a Minister if he had not supported the 1986 Act. The Prime Minister says that he believes in a citizens charter. If Conservative members of the Committee believed in that, we should end this morning's sitting by giving to elderly people a charter and the right to advocacy.</span></p>
