<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>

<p>No. 82, in page 3, line 27, leave out from first 'to' to end of line 28 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'the education of any specified age group'.</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. On Tuesday evening, we discussed truancy in grant-maintained schools. I made the point that, as grant-maintained schools involve greater investment by the local community, they are able to reduce truancy rates and improve attendance. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) replied that when he was teaching at St. Wilfrid's the problem was solved by getting rid of and suspending difficult pupils. That implied that Small Heath school had improved its attendance record only by getting rid of or suspending difficult pupils. I thought that that was a slur on the school, so I got in touch with its deputy head and was told that, far from suspending pupils, in the past nine years it has suspended only one pupil and that that was before it became grant-maintained. I give the hon. Member for Hemsworth the opportunity of retracting what was plainly an erroneous and fallacious statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order, but it helps the hon. Member to put the record straight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it normal practice for an hon. Member to inform another hon. Member that he is going to raise a matter of concern to him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is usually a matter of courtesy. I do not think that any discourtesy was intended.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 3, line 27, after 'education', insert '(except nursery education)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 105, in schedule 2, page 150, line 26, at end insert 'or to nursery schools'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there is general agreement that effective education can be built only upon high-quality education for children between the ages of three and eight. Most, if not all, advanced industrial nations accept that and provide quality nursery and early education. At the same time, they ensure that highly trained professional educators work with the younger children in their schools. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must be fair to the hon. Lady. There is a lot of background noise in the Room. I call Bridie Prentice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I shall speak to you later about my first name.<br><br>
Tragically, the Bill does not refer to nursery education and its vital contribution, both educational and vocational, to successful schooling—<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is a serious amendment. I hope that my hon. Friends will do me the courtesy of letting me put the case for it.<br><br>
Nursery education lays the foundations for all that follows. In Britain, it is a bit of a lottery, the chances of receiving any form of nursery education depend less on the child's needs than on where he or she lives. I hope that hon. Members will agree that such an important learning experience should not be left to chance and that all parents should have the right to send their children to a nursery school if they wish.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 83 and 105 would ensure that there is a coherent approach to nursery education so that all children under five could attend local community nursery schools and that local education authorities could establish and maintain such schools. Nursery education should be expanded and integrated with the day care provision that is available in local authorities. That could best be achieved if local education authorities took the strategic role in that regard alongside their responsibility for related services.<br><br>
Amendment No. 83 would remove the administrative confusion and chaos that would ensue if the responsibility was shared with the funding agency. If the local education authority has specific funding—whether it has a commitment to nursery education or whether it makes little provision at present—it could expand or establish nursery education within its area. However, the White Paper "Choice and Diversity" refers only briefly to nursery education. It does not mention the continuing power of local authorities to provide such education in their areas. In his introduction to the White Paper, the Prime Minister states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
I apologise for the grammar, but it is the Prime Minister's, not mine—
<br><blockquote><p>"determined that every child in this country should have the very best start in life".</p></blockquote>
However, the White Paper does not ensure that nursery education is universally available; nor does it propose a coherent extension of nursery education. As I said on Second Reading and again today, nursery education is not mentioned in the Bill. Given the extensive research that shows the value of nursery education to young people through their school lives, that is a grave omission. I hope that the Committee will help to rectify that by supporting the amendments.<br><br>
According to "Choice and Diversity"—a misnomer—the legal position is that primary education includes full-time nursery education. Therefore, schools can continue to provide full-time education for under-fives when they become grant-maintained. However, grant-maintained schools can provide part-time nursery education only as an agent of the local education authority. Nursery education is not part of the mandatory system. It is often provided on a part-time basis, especially where demand outstrips supply. It is appropriate for grant-maintained schools to continue to act as agents for the local education authority in providing part-time nursery education. Local education authorities will thus continue to be responsible for the overall service.<br><br>
Different local authorities have different policies for nursery education, because it is not part of the mandatory system. It is educational to examine the figures for local authority provision. It is pleasing to note from a written answer that the local education authority in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) is second in the country for its provision of nursery education. Out of 108 authorities, Devon, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) is 98th. He must try to persuade that authority to do better. Berkshire is 100th. I hope that the Government Whip will have a word with that authority to ensure that its nursery provision improves. The Minister will be especially worried, because his local education authority is 103rd. Worst of all, Conservative-controlled Wiltshire provides nursery education for only 17·9 per cent. of its under-fives. That is a disgraceful indictment. I hope that hon. Members who represent Wiltshire constituencies will pressurise their local education authority to do better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has not mentioned Wandsworth, which offers a nursery place to every three-year-old child. That position will continue to be available. The hon. Lady has not referred to nursery classes within primary schools. I hope that she will explain how the amendment will help both nursery schools and nursery classes to flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to mention Wandsworth. I accept the valid point about nursery places and nursery schools. I mentioned it earlier when I discussed the current position of grant-maintained schools. Wandsworth does well when compared with East Sussex, Norfolk, Berkshire, Hereford, Worcester and Wiltshire. However, when compared with Labour-controlled boroughs, it does badly. Hammersmith, Fulham, Lewisham, which is in my constituency, and even Lambeth do better than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
Wandsworth in providing nursery places. At this stage, I do not want to spend much time discussing Wandsworth because I want to talk about it later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to reiterate that Wandsworth was the first LEA in the country to offer a place to every three-year-old whose parents' wished that child to take that place. That cannot be bettered by other London boroughs, although may be some of them are catching up. The offer is there for every three-year-old child. How can one do better than 100 per cent.?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, only 41·4 per cent. of under-fives are in nursery schools. The hon. Gentleman must accept the figures, which are provided by the Department for Education, not by me.<br><br>
Different LEAs have different policies for the provision of nursery education—some provide no places, while others accommodate many of their children. How can the funding agency decide on the appropriate provision in a particular authority? The Bill does not state at what level such provision is to be made. There are two possibilities: one is that the funding agency would be forced to apply different policies in different parts of the country, depending on the LEA's policy in the area concerned. The other would be to establish a national policy for nursery education, by which provision in a particular area would then be judged. The latter possibility may have some attraction, but is not it a rather strange position for the funding agency to be in? There is no legislative basis on which it can determine the appropriate level of nursery education across the country. It must be more appropriate for the LEAs to continue to hold responsibility for providing nursery education, even when the funding agency takes full responsibility for primary education.<br><br>
Paragraph 6(2) schedule 2 excludes special schools. The amendments would ensure that the same exclusion would apply to nursery schools. I presume that special schools have already been excluded because of the LEA's ability to respond to the required level of provision. Since nursery education is not mandatory, LEAs should be expected to determine the appropriate level of nursery provision in their areas.<br><br>
Sometimes nursery provision can be part of a programme that reflects the particular circumstances and local needs. LEAs might be required to provide nursery places as an agency implementing national or urban inner-city programmes. Nursery education should be treated in the same way as special education.<br><br>
Paragraph 6 of schedule 2 defines the responsibilities that are to transfer to the funding agency from the LEAs when either the 75 per cent. exit point is reached or the LEAs ask the Secretary of State to make such an order. LEAs may not establish or begin to maintain a school unless they have already ceased to maintain other schools. LEAs are still multi-service authorities and may be providing nursery education as part of a programme, reflecting local needs and local circumstances. They might provide such places, particularly now, to carry out the responsibility of making and maintaining statements for children under the age of five with special educational needs.<br><br>
Paragraph 7.11 of the White Paper recognises the key role that LEAs play in the provision of nursery education by allowing grant-maintained schools to make such provision only as agents for the LEA. That must underline
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
the LEAs' responsibility in that area. The LEAs may also have to deal with that when a grant-maintained school ceases to provide nursery education.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 83 and 105 would reinforce the integral role of local education authorities in providing nursery education. I hope that the Minister will accept the need for LEAs to have that strategic role in the provision of education for under-fives, and that he will give a commitment to provide the necessary resources to guarantee the right of parents to send their children to local nursery schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) and congratulate her on her excellent speech supporting nursery education.<br><br>
As primary education encompasses nursery provision, it is necessary to make it clear that such provision falls outside the purpose of the clause. Only the local education authority should continue to deal with the strategic policy relating to nursery education, even if the remainder of primary education was funded by the funding agency.<br><br>
Many local education authorities are developing nursery education as part of their community provision, integrating its management with that of other community services. To put such development at risk would deter creative thinking by local authorities and make it more difficult for them to respond to the needs of the community in respect of nursery provision. Many people would be reassured by a commitment to continue local government responsibility for a provision often perceived to be at risk in the budgeting exercise. I know from experience in local government that, sadly every time cuts or savings are needed, nursery provision is the first to come under threat. There is litle doubt that nursery provision would be more vulnerable in the control of a body that had no accountability to the community and was dependent on Government funding.<br><br>
All families want the best start for their children, and much needs to be done to provide families with access to quality education and child care. I was a member of the Select Committee that, in 1989, carried out an in-depth study on education for under-fives. The Select Committee's report was presented unanimously to the House. It expressed the view that
<br><blockquote><p>"Education for under fives … can not only enrich the child's life at the time but can also prepare the child for the whole process of schooling."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee made several important recommendations on pre-school provision, not all of which are relevant to the amendments. Of those that are relevant, the first was that
<br><blockquote><p>"It should be the objective of both central and local government to ensure the steady expansion of provision of nursery education until it is available to all 3 and 4 year old children whose parents desire it for them."</p></blockquote>
The Select Committee went on to recommend that
<br><blockquote><p>"Future Public Expenditure White Papers should make higher provision for under fives."</p></blockquote>
One of the most important recommendations was that every LEA shoud have an early-year adviser.<br><br>
If a funding agency were to take over strategic planning—if that is the right term—of nursery provision, how could it achieve those aims? Nursery provision is not yet mandatory, yet, legally, primary education includes full-time nursery provision, the responsibility for which could pass to the funding agencies. They would not have the skills or commitment necessary for that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
Whenever nursery education is discussed, there is an abundance of good will toward the idea of its expansion. Sadly, there is little evidence of a financial commitment from the Government to enable that. So God help us if the funding agencies take over that strategic responsibility. The expansion of nursery education has been discussed for years without any appropriate action having been taken. Indeed, the Government's present meagre provision is under threat, as a consequence of the Bill's proposal to put the provision of nursery education into the funding agencies' hands. They would have to establish a national policy—a prospect which frightens me to death, because the Government have repeatedly shown that they have no real interest in nursery education. There is no guarantee that funding agencies would formulate such a policy.<br><br>
No more than a couple of years ago—probably less, since time flies—the previous Secretary of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said that Baronness Thatcher had got it wrong when, in 1972, as Secretary of State for Education and Science, she advocated nursery provision for all. Our western European counterparts realise the value of pre-school education, and provide it for a much greater proportion of their children. Britain compares badly with France and Belgium in the provision of pre-school education for children aged two to four.<br><br>
I accept, Mr. Martin, that in mentioning the following statistics, I shall be going a little wide of the amendment, but it is important to compare the state of nursery education in this country with that in our western European counterparts and to contemplate the result of the funding agencies taking responsibility for nursery provision.<br><br>
France supplies places in nursery schools, kindergartens or similar establishments for one third of all two-year-olds, while Belgium, Finland and Norway provide for one fifth. The corresponding figure for the United Kingdom is 1·3 per cent. Some 25 per cent. of three-year-olds in the United Kingdom are provided with a pre-school place whereas the figure is 95 per cent. in France and 94 per cent. in Belgium. Nearly every child in western Europe has a nursery school, kindergarten or other form of pre-school place, but only 68 per cent. of children in this country have one.<br><br>
Whenever nursery education is discussed, there is an abundance of good will toward the idea of its expansion. Sadly, there is little evidence of a financial commitment from the Government to enable that expansion. The expansion of nursery education has been considered for years without appropriate action being taken. The current meagre provision is under severe attack from the Government's spending cuts. We must protect existing nursery provision before the funding agency gets its hands on it.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am not following the hon. Gentleman's argument. He has spent a lot of time explaining that the provision of nursery education is unsatisfactory in many local authority areas, yet he wants to maintain the very system that is not delivering. Perhaps I misunderstand him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman made that point. The current provision is not very good, but the LEAs that provide it are in the main Labour-controlled.—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I accept that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
Wandsworth might have improved its nursery provision. The figures do not show that, but it might have improved in the past two years; my figures may be out of date.<br><br>
I am worried that if the funding agency were to get its hands on nursery education the current provision would disappear. If LEAs were given the responsibility and the funding, the provision of nursery education would expand. If it were given to the funding agency that provision would cease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The provision of nursery education in Wandsworth has improved in the past two or three years since it has been run by Wandsworth council; before that it was run by the Labour-controlled Inner London education authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures for Labour-controlled London boroughs are better than those for Wandsworth. But I congratulate Wandsworth if it has decided to invest in nursery education. I hope that Wiltshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire will follow Wandsworth's example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) is correct, the reason that Wandsworth has such a sound base for nursery education compared with other Conservative-controlled authorities is because the Inner London education authority gave it that sound base?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. I do not take a great interest in London politics; I have a greater interest in the politics of the north-east which are much more sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall just recount an episode involving an ILEA school in Lambeth, where I was a governor. It took ILEA two years to arrange for tiles to be put back on the walls of the school. That is more typical of ILEA than anything that is now happening in Wandsworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was probably out of order, so I shall not take the bait. I am trying to maintain a serious debate. With the rate support grant that Wandsworth receives from the Government I would expect it not only to provide nursery education for all, but to send every kid to a private school.<br><br>
We should understand that the current level of provision is no thanks to the Government. For the Government to claim credit for increased provision or increased spending on education takes some beating.<br><br>
Statistics provided by the Department for Education in answer to parliamentary questions show that the top 20 providers of nursery education are Labour-run LEAs. Were it not for Labour authorities, nursery provision would be negligible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Statistics issued by the Department for Education these days are sometimes wrong, as we saw last week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My LEA, Durham, is among the top 10 providers of nursery education. Durham's standard spending assessment for nursery provision in the 1992–93 settlement was £9·4 million, but it provides 4,131 places more than the SSA allows. Durham spends £6 million more than it is entitled to spend under the rate support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
grant element for nursery provision, such is its commitment to nursery education. I am worried about what will happen to that commitment if the funding agency takes control of nursery provision.<br><br>
In spite of extreme financial difficulties, Durham county council is opening new nursery schools and classes in every financial year. It has a planned, methodical system for nursery provision, in common with many other Labour local authorities. I fear that if the funding agency is responsible for nursery provision it will probably reduce rather than increase it.<br><br>
The Government's downright dishonesty on the issue of nursery education is a disgrace. They claim credit for increased expenditure but in many cases they rate-cap Labour authorities that increase their education spending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed how Labour LEAs spend their money, not just in the nursery sector but on school provision in general. If it were not for the extra money that Labour authorities spend on their education service, there would have been a huge drop in overall spending on education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow my hon. Friend's line or I shall be ruled out of order. However, he is right, as the Select Committee on Education found time and again when it considered education spending on a yearly basis. If local authorities did not spend above their SSA on education, the provision would be far less than it is at present, not only in nursery provision but in every other sector, as my hon. Friend said.<br><br>
Nursery education is special and today it is needed more urgently than ever. I repeat—I shall do so until the Minister promises to support the amendment—the Bill as drafted puts nursery provision under threat. Nursery education plays a crucial role in developing a child's ability to benefit from later education. It helps the child to form a positive attitude towards its future schooling. The Plowden, Bullock and Warnock reports to name but a few, stressed the importance and desirability of nursery education, but the hope-for expansion has yet to occur. The Government have not helped. The LEAs have been left to provide that service. If the funding agency takes over, no funds will be available, as that agency will be dependent on Government grants. We know, from experience, the Government's feelings towards nursery education.<br><br>
The evidence of the Association of County Councils to the Select Committee on Education stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Education research has consistently indicated that the most important single step towards the improvement of the quality of education in this country would be to provide a coherent and comprehensive system of pre-school education for all."</p></blockquote>
Could the Bill achieve that? I do not think it could. Only well-resourced LEAs could achieve that. It is the same old story—a lack of money from central Government to provide the necessary services.<br><br>
Before the age of five, children experience their most rapid period of development—physically, socially, emotionally and intellectually. Nurseries provide carefully planned and structured environments to stimulate the child's curiosity and to help him or her to make sense of the world. The nursery lays the foundation of the child's future learning and provides the optimum conditions for early educational experiences. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of our children benefit from nursery education

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
and whether they receive it depends on where they live. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East summed it up when he described it as a lottery.<br><br>
Such a situation is better than nursery provision being under funding agency control. That would mean nil expansion, and probably a cut in existing provision. I repeat that the Government's record on funding nursery provision does not do them credit.<br><br>
If one does not live in a Labour-controlled education authority or one is unable to pay for a private nursery, the most important and crucial stage in a child's life will be missed. Undoubtedly, nursery education particularly benefits the disadvantaged child. The skills and expertise of a trained nursery teacher and a trained nursery nurse can help diagnose any potential handicap or special needs that a child may have.<br><br>
We must acknowledge that nursery education is not a luxury, but an investment. Our children deserve the best possible provision during their vital formative years. We must make more nursery places for pre-school children available. That can only be done if LEAs receive the appropriate funding and resources from central Government. If the Government recognise the value of nursery education, as they claim they do, they would accept the amendments, and realise that the funding agency is not capable of delivering the necessary strategic local plan.<br><br>
If the amendments are not accepted, the achievements of some LEAs might be lost. That would be tragic. If LEAs were obligated to provide nursery education for all pre-school children, the discrepancies between the nursery provision of LEAs would disappear. The necessary resources and obligatory nursery provision would provide the way forward. Although the Government will not accept the amendments, I hope that they will examine our arguments, so that we can look forward to the growth and not the demise of nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the important matter of nursery provision, which is non-statutory. The number of places provided in an area is subject to local decisions and conditions. The amendment has been tabled because Opposition Members recognise the importance of good quality nursery education.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
Nursery education gives children a good start in life and is also good for parents. In my constituency I have met many parents with young children who live in flats on the second or third floor. There is little room for the children to play in and little opportunity for recreation. In such circumstances, the benefits of a good nursery education cannot be underestimated. Some interesting work has been done in the north of England, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend, if he were here, could supply more details about the evidence that shows that nursery education is important in the early years of a child's life and for long afterwards. The work in the north of England was done with a cohort of children who received nursery education in their early years. Those children were followed and compared with a control group who did not have the benefit of nursery education. Surprisingly, it was found that the children who had attended nursery school performed significantly better both in school and when they began to study for A-levels in post-16 education. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
important and profound piece of work underlines the importance that Opposition Members attach to the provision of nursery education.<br><br>
It is important that local provision of nursery education should be linked with local social services and health care. The experience of those agencies could be used to provide information about the desirability or otherwise of the provision of nursery education in various areas. Ideally, we should try to ensure that all parents who want their children to receive nursery education can take advantage of the appropriate provision.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have mentioned local authorities where nursery provision is lamentable. I am glad that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) has re-entered the Room, as his authority is one of the worst. I looked up the Department for Education statistics for the number of children in nursery schools in his area. There are two children in full-time nursery provision, 399 in part-time provision and only 460 in nursery classes. Norfolk is an enormous county, but it has fewer than 1,000 children who benefit from even part-time nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may not have heard my earlier exchange with the hon. Member for City of Durham. Opposition Members have told the Committee that nursery education provision under the present system is inadequate. I do not entirely disagree with that, given that the Norfolk LEA is responsible for that in my area. That point is clear enough. What I cannot understand is what Opposition Members mean as far as the Bill is concerned. On the one hand they say that the situation is thoroughly unsatisfactory, yet on the other they want to defend the status quo. That is typical of their approach to the whole Bill. I do not understand the hon. Lady's logic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if my point was not clear to the hon. Gentleman: it is clear to my hon. Friends. It is Labour-controlled local authorities that provide the best opportunities for nursery education. Conservative-controlled authorities, such as Norfolk, fail lamentably in their duty. There is no evidence that a remote body such as the funding agency will be responsive to local need or recognise the importance of nursery education.<br><br>
The means of funding nursery education is important also. I believe that the present standard spending assessment for each authority allocates money for under-fives provision. Local education authorities usually take their funding for nursery education from that source. It is vital that LEAs continue receiving resources through the SSA settlement for the provision of nursery education.<br><br>
I fear that problems could arise with nursery classes in primary schools if the schools or the parents succumb—in the Minister's words—to grant-maintained status. Grant-maintained schools would then continue to be agents of the LEA and to act as agents for the continuing provision of education in a nursery class.<br><br>
I shall give an example from my constituency that underlines the importance of local strategic planning for nursery education. King Hedges school, a primary school north of Cambridge, merged its junior and infant schools several years ago. During extensive consultations between the LEA and parents, it became obvious that the decision was not universally popular. The LEA promised, as if to mollify parents, that if they agreed to the merging of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
schools, it would undertake to provide nursery education for two full classes from then on. I would not wish such undertakings to be undermined by the removal of nursery education from LEA jurisdiction.<br><br>
It is important to remember that LEAs are responsible for health and safety in this context and that they are accustomed to liaising with the private sector and with private playgroups that are registered with them. There is an indisputable argument overall for keeping nursery school provision under the strategic control of the LEA. I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment as an important addition to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make it clear at the outset that I do not intend to be contentious. I wish also to assist the Minister as best I can to perfect the Bill. He and I differ on the philosophy of education and on the core of the Bill, but I accept that the measure before us is what the Minister wishes to go forward and that he has presented the Bill so that we can put right in Committee the things that are wrong with it. He would not need to bring the Bill to Committee if he did not wish the slow grind of democracy to smooth the surface, which is now rough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given his current theme, does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister showed a commendable spirit this morning by announcing that he would re-examine the issues that were raised in our debate last Tuesday and this morning about special needs and equal opportunities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was heartened by what the Minister said this morning because it implied that the seed that we have sown has not fallen on stony ground and that the Minister will change the Bill, which is not perfect.<br><br>
There is a common saying that if one gives the Jesuits a nine-year-old boy and they educate him until he is 18, he is theirs for life. I do not accept that, because the first five years of a child's life are the most important. Nursery education is, therefore, important and should be fostered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that issue of teaching young children, did not the Jesuits despair of the schooling introduced in cantons in Switzerland by John Calvin? They described early schools set up by John Calvin as
<br><blockquote><p>"the mines whence comes the ores of heresy".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). He is right, although that quote did not spring to my mind. I pay tribute to the honourable tradition of methodism and non-conformism to which my hon. Friend clings. The non-conformist spirit of the Jesuits has led them to set up a variety of schools in south America for very young children who have been abandoned. The Jesuits have moved from secondary to pre-primary education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that I have discovered that my mother's cousin was headmaster of the Jesuit school that the hon. Member for Hemsworth regards with some affection, I shall briefly join the argument. I agree with him about the importance of nursery education. The Jesuits have accepted that a child's education should start younger. I thought that the common saying referred to a seven-year-old boy, not a nine-year-old, as the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
Some of the arguments in Committee have been irrelevant. Wandsworth, without any extra funding—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—funding for nursery education—manages to provide a nursery place for every child whose parents wish to take it. That provision will continue under LEAs, and GM schools will continue to provide nursery education on the slightly enhanced funding to which the Opposition have referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to nursery education in Wandsworth. I cannot, however, let an inaccuracy pass. Jesuit schools have not headmasters but rectors and prefects of studies. The hon. Gentleman's uncle was prefect of studies at St. Michael's. He was a fine socialist.<br><br>
A study last year showed that the intellectual development of a child begins in the mother's womb. I do not suggest that funding agencies should take any responsibility for pregnant women, but it is important to remember that almost from the moment that life is breathed into the embryo the child starts to develop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point. Research suggests that problems such as dyslexia and autism are caused by some malfunction while the child is in the womb. Of course, the funding agency has no role there, but it is important to bear that research in mind.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I recognise that it is a serious point but it is wide of the amendment, which deals with nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Martin. The moment I mentioned it I withdrew the suggestion that the funding agencies were responsible for pregnant women. However, my point is that some form of education—of arousal or excitement—is needed from the earliest moment in a life. A baby in a cot or in its mother's arms is aware of everything around it. All parents want to arouse that awareness, but, for a variety of reasons, sometimes it is not possible for them to look after their children. That is where nannies and nursery nurses are important. They have the earliest contact with the children, and the more expertise that is available in that sector, the more assured will our nation's future be.<br><br>
The imaginative thinking in nursery education is a joy to behold. The Prime Minister referred this afternoon to May day. I was delighted to hear that, because that old mediaeval tradition is often celebrated in nursery schools, where children dance round the maypole clinging to multi-coloured ribbons. That teaches them a sense of rhythm and of colour. It stimulates their imagination. It may not be the true symbol of maypole dancing, which, to be exact, was meant originally to remind people to say a requiem mass for Henry VIII. However, it is part of our history—what a shame that the Prime Minister did not go to a nursery school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend is making an important point about the way in which young children learn, in nursery school or otherwise. I hope that my hon. Friend can help me, as I recall reading somewhere that the maypole also had a mathematical significance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I had not intended to go into detail, but it is important to demonstrate the teaching possibilities that arise in nursery education. The maypole goes back to pre-Christian days and has all sorts of mythical and pythagorian significances. All hon. Members know the theorem of Pythagoras and its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
manifestation in the maypole, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend for reminding me of it.<br><br>
Local education authorities provide a variety of nursery education, and the variety is important. I know of one authority where there was a prejudice against anything that was not run by the local authority. That attitude was bad because it led to a sameness and did not recognise the intimate acquaintance with the local area and with small children that is required. However, such attitudes have long since disappeared.<br><br>
Many authorities now run co-operatives, as I would call them. Other people call them play groups. A variety of such institutions, in addition to nursery places and nursery schools, provide stimulus for younger people. It is important for them to be integrated with the social services. It would be disastrous for the social services to be doing one thing and nursery education doing another. Often the social services identify the children who most need a nursery place. The social services are to remain with the local authority and can, therefore, be well integrated into the provision of nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that the Government run inner-city and other programmes that provide funding in circumstances such as my hon. Friend describes, where the social services department has a primary responsibility to help children from particularly deprived backgrounds to have the educational experience provided by a nursery? It is therefore important that the LEA should have the major role in providing for nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is one of the few areas where I willingly pay tribute to what has been done by the Government. Although funding is often provided for economic and commercial development in inner cities through bodies that are independent of the local authority, the Government have wisely left with the LEA that aspect of assisting in inner cities. Excellent work is being done by LEAs.<br><br>
As my hon. Friends said in their excellent contributions, nursery education should be treated in the same way as special education is treated in the Bill. It should remain apart from the funding agencies and with the LEA, because the LEA is also the planning authority. It can therefore project the number of places needed, and is aware of the social difficulties that exist. For example, there are probably fewer social difficulties in Wandsworth than in Bow and Poplar. I do not say that there are no social difficulties in Wandsworth—there are bound to be some—but it is easier to contain social disadvantage and help it, as Wandsworth does, if there is a decent mix, rather than a completely deprived area. In the centre of Leeds and parts of Bradford, for example, the situation is extremely difficult, and nursery provision there is important.<br><br>
I am pleased that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have made no distinction between nursery schools and nursery places. We must be flexible. To create new nursery places, it may not be necessary to build new nursery schools. There are difficulties and constraints where nursery places are required, and it is often immensely expensive, whereas the extension of an existing school, whether a grant-maintained school or an LEA school, may be preferable. Grant-maintained schools are funded in a particular way. We must ensure that LEA schools also receive a generous capital allowance for nursery education.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
Local education authorities have a good track record in setting up nursery schools and providing nursery places, once they set their minds to it. The problem is that, initially, providing nursery education was very expensive. Those councils which—properly in some cases—did not want to overspend, cut out nursery education, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said. If the Government are to examine the SSA, they should ensure that authorities can afford nursery education.<br><br>
The way in which the SSA is decided at present is outrageous. For example, I have a flat in Pimlico, which is in Westminster, where the poll tax is low. My home is in Pontefract, in the metropolitan district of Wakefield where the poll tax is much higher. Compared with Hemsworth, South Kirkby, South Elmsall, Havercroft and other areas where the pits are closing and there is decline and grime, Wesminster is a dream. That local authority has an easy job. If Wakefield metropolitan district had the same SSA and grants as Westminster I would pay no poll tax in Pontefract and at Christmas time the authority could send £15 as a special token of regard to all its citizens. Of course, Wakefield district council would do no such thing: it would spend the extra money on nursery provision.<br><br>
The distribution of SSAs should be much fairer. Two pits are closed in an area that already has special status and the Government give it yet more money. Two pits are closing in my area, leading to 40 per cent. unemployment in some places, with all the problems that that implies for young children in nursery education, and the Government give us nothing. There should be some equity. I do not expect the Minister to respond today, but he can take his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer aside and acquaint him with my anxieties.<br><br>
Authorities such as Wandsworth, which are on the left-wing of the Tory party, are in favour of nursery education. Right-wing authorities who are hell-bent on destroying themselves and their jobs have virtually no nursery education provision. That is the simple equation. All Labour authorities do decently, because they are superior. It is scandalous that Norfolk, a rich county whose standard of living we admire in our patch, provides so few nursery places. Now that they are so popular, the Minister should provide a league table of nursery places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend has made an important point. Norfolk is part of the East Anglia standard planning region, and in the past decade it has had the best record on employment opportunities. It is also quite high on the scale of relative prosperity. Surely that area should have a 100 per cent. provision of nursery places. It is a pity that we cannot explore that point further, but it is important in relation to the role of the funding agency and of the local authority.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for confirming what I said.<br><br>
In my student days, when I did my diploma of education after I had taken my degree, I read much about the late great Jenny Lee. I read her biography and some of her early writings. She placed great emphasis on the part that nursery education could play in the fight against poverty. The correlation between poverty and backwardness is 0·9; that is the highest possible correlation. Jenny Lee was determined that we should counter that. She said that nursery education—appropriate education before the age of five—was crucial to that fight.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are always interested in league tables, and they set much store by them. My hon. Friend might be interested to know that Norfolk receives more than £10 million for the nursery element of its standing spending assessment. In that case it should provide 6,895 places; in fact, it provides only 5,686 places. That is a deficit of 1,209, so the money must be spent on something else, but goodness knows what. I could go through the tables and compare authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be fascinated to do what my hon. Friend suggests. He might wish to read the tables into the record. I shall certainly examine them later. That proves Jenny Lee's point. She also said that not only the deprived, decaying parts of inner cities had problems. The rural poor in Norfolk are very poor indeed. If someone is poor in a rich area, he is very poor and his whole spirit is downcast. It is extremely hard to move out of the depression that is cast upon him by poverty in the midst of riches. That is all the more reason for Norfolk to provide more nursery places.<br><br>
We are not aiming for nursery schools to teach the theorem of the square on the hypothenuse—not even with maypoles. But we are aiming to ensure that, when children go to school at five or seven, as they do in Germany—they are ready, willing and eager to learn so that they become citizens of whom we can justly be proud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is about parental choice—not just the appearance of choice, but genuine choice. If the funding agency takes over all responsibility for providing education in its area, it will carry out only those duties that fall under its statutory obligation. I cannot understand how a quango in Darlington—or wherever else it may be placed—will be sensitive to local needs and how it will respond to the demands of local people in every community and constituency including yours, Mr. Martin. The funding agency will be a monolithic body that will carry out its statutory obligations under the ever-watchful eye of the Secretary of State for Education.<br><br>
The amendment would give LEAs the power to continue to operate in a way that is responsive to the needs and wishes of local people. It is a cry for the local determination of some matters within the education system. Nursery education is high on the agenda in next year's local elections, when the electorate cast their votes in May. Local people will scour the parties' literature to study which one gives a commitment to provide nursery education; that will help determine the way in which people will vote.<br><br>
It is important for people to put pressure on their LEAs to carry out their wishes: to have expenditure determined and directed in a way that they wish in their communities. On occasion, I have heard Conservative Ministers say, "Well, of course people are free to pay for nursery education." Of course one is free to pay for nursery education, so long as one can afford to pay. Sadly, increasing numbers of people who find themselves out of work or on reduced income find that they are less and less able to pay.<br><br>
There is no question of the undenied need and value of nursery education. That point has been amply articulated by several of my hon. Friends, so I shall not discuss it. All evidence suggests that nursery education provides children with that first stepping stone onto a further good education.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
The fact that there is a demand for nursery education needs to be reinforced in the Committee. Parents across the country realise the value of nursery education and are demanding places. In my constituency, a school offers nursery provision, but it has just 25 places. The headmistress has 107 children on the waiting list. As has been said frequently in Committee, children go through education once; by the time those children reach the top of the waiting list they will probably be aged about seven or eight and will have passed the stage at which they would have benefited from that nursery education.<br><br>
Yesterday, I took myself away from the stimulation and excitement of the Committee and found myself in leafy Buckinghamshire. In the well-heeled environment of a village, I saw nannies pushing prams and walking children down a street. These were almost idyllic rural surroundings. I thought what benefits those children enjoyed as I reflected on the poorly-provided-for children in my constituency who live in high-rise flats, cramped maisonettes and damp and inadequate surroundings.<br><br>
I reflected on the increasing numbers of children in my constituency who live in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in the most appalling conditions imaginable. I contrasted yesterday's children in the leafy lanes of Buckinghamshire with those in my area whose need for nursery places is so desperate.<br><br>
Parents want nursery education for their children because providing a stimulating environment within the limitations of their own homes in poor conditions is often exceedingly difficult. Head teachers who take reception classes tell me that many children come to school unable to read or write, and in some instances incapable of speech. Teachers spend the first months in those classes teaching children to speak and to relate to one another. Those from the most deprived backgrounds who suffer the greatest social disadvantage because their parents are unable, because of their employment or financial circumstances, to pay for such services need nursery education. The demand is huge.<br><br>
My initial question was whether the funding agency will be in a position to respond freely and sensitively to the needs and wishes of local people. I contend that a centralised monopoly will do anything but that. Parents need choice. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said that many times. The real choice is the power to go out and elect to an LEA councillors who will carry out their wishes and provide nursery education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, some LEAs provide nursery education. Some do not, as the lists show. In future some will be able to, and will, and some will not. Some grant-maintained schools will be able to, and will follow the wishes of parents by providing it. They will do this if they can provide from funding, on precisely the same basis as current provision for nursery education. If the hon. Gentleman believes, as many of my hon. Friends do, that there is insufficient provision of nursery education and that the Government should play a part in directing that more be provided, he cannot disagree with the powers being given to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to give guidance and direction to the funding authorities, which he opposed when we debated their establishment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Battersea has raised the very point that I was about to make. Local authorities provide nursery education at present. It is mainly Labour authorities—although some are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
Conservative—that provide nursery places. My point is that those councils provide places in response to the pressures and wishes of local people who vote them in, and vote them out. They are therefore reacting to the needs of their electorates. The Bill does not give grant-maintained schools the power to provide nursery education. They can do so, but they will not receive funding. I hope that we shall discuss that later.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Battersea raised an important point of which the Minister may like to take note. In an area where the funding agency has taken over all responsibility, either because the LEA has passed the 10 per cent. point and decided to go into voluntary euthanasia, or because the 75 per cent. point has been reached, from where will LEAs get the money to provide nursery education? If the funding agencies take over, will there be a decrease in nursery education because the LEAs can fund it no longer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect what the hon. Member for Battersea says and I listen to him with interest because I believe that he has an interest in education, unlike some Conservative Members.<br><br>
A proportion of the standard spending assessment of every LEA is intended for nursery provision. If funding agencies take over, will that funding still reach grant-maintained schools? I doubt it, because the commitment to do so will not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has put his finger on the issue. We need the Minister's reassurance on the matter, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Battersea and other members of the Committee would also appreciate it. If the funding agency takes over responsibility for providing education, will the Audit Commission or the Minister oversee that part of the funds to ensure that nursery education is provided, or will the money disappear in a black hole, which would mean no nursery education at all?<br><br>
The amendment would give parents an enabling power—the power to choose a local authority and to choose councillors who will provide the service that parents want, such as nursery education. The amendment would also give parents the power to choose something else—genuine choice as opposed to control by a funding agency that is remote, national and insensitive to local needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to the situation in Wales. I believe that the Under-Secretary of State will be able to answer my questions. The Minister of State, Welsh Office is obviously absent.<br><br>
I support my hon. Friends' wish to exclude nursery education from the operations of the Welsh schools funding council, just as special education is likely to be excluded. Nursery education is not a mandatory service. Therefore, if the schools funding council for Wales or grant-maintained schools have a responsibility for nursery education, it is possible that the less diligent among them would provide a less than adequate and less than satisfactory service.<br><br>
The provision of nursery education in Wales has been extremely good. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend tells me that he attended school before he was five. I had the good fortune 40-odd years ago to go to nursery school in Abersychan in my constituency, and in the summer had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
the equally good fortune to open the Blaenavon nursery school summer fete. Virtually the entire population of that small town in my constituency turned out for the event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, I went to school full-time before the age of five. Breconshire county council had a very forward-looking policy. Shortly after my nursery days were over, it began to provide for children of two years of age and upwards. I remember vividly as a seven or eight-year-old getting stuck, on carnival day in Brecon, in the nursery schools's foundations. I nearly missed the carnival, but that shows how far back the policy goes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That anecdote illustrates the importance that Welsh LEAs have always attached to nursery education in our valleys, cities and rural areas. Indeed, the headteacher of the Blaenavon nursery school was awarded the MBE for her service to nursery education, and the school has also won many special awards.<br><br>
For many decades education authorities such as Breconshire, as it then was, or Monmouthshire, have been forward looking. Their vision went far beyond that of education authorities in other parts of Britain. There could be a serious fragmentation of the provision of nursery education in Wales if the funding council and the grant-maintained schools took over that rule. It will be useful for the Committee to know that 69 per cent. of all two, three or four-year-olds in Wales are in full or part-time nursery education, according to the most recent Welsh Office figures. That means that about 53,000 Welsh youngsters are in nursery education—4,000 in schools and 48,000 in classes. There are 832 primary schools with nurseries in Wales. Moreover, 90 per cent. of children under five in West Glamorgan have nursery education. The figure is 80 per cent. in Clwyd, 73 per cent. in Mid Glamorgan and 70 per cent. in Gwent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend mentioned the 73 per cent. of young children in Mid Glamorgan who have an opportunity to enjoy some nursery education. That county has had to freeze its provision at that level for some because it was unable to persuade the Government to give it the extra funding that would allow the service to expand. Even that very creditable figure of 73 per cent. is less than the local authority would like to provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is the case. I am sure also that my hon. Friend, who represents a Mid Glamorgan constituency, knows that the top providers among Welsh local authorities are Labour-controlled. We can make no comparison between them and Conservative-controled LEAs in Wales, as there are none of the latter. However, the three valley LEAs—West Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan and Gwent—are among the highest providers. It is no coincidence that, by any measure of social deprivation, those valley communities have the worst problems associated with single parents and disadvantaged children in Wales.<br><br>
That is why such a premium is placed on nursery education, which could suffer if the Bill remains unamended. The fragmentation of the nursery and education services in the rural and Welsh-speaking areas of the Principality would be a grave disadvantage. That is why I support the amendments.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The omission of provision for nursery education leaves a gap in the Bill. I do not know why the Government did not include nursery education in the measure. The debate will help us to find out.<br><br>
The Education Act 1944 makes clear the responsibility of LEAs for full-time nursery education. In the light of what the Minister said earlier about the gaps that we discovered in the Bill's special needs and equal opportunities provisions, the funding agency, when it takes over the role of an LEA—perhaps before the end of the next century—could be responsible for full-time nursery provision. Will the funding agency and the funding council, as non-departmental public bodies, be responsible for that provision? Such bodies usually carry out functions of central Government. Full-time nursery provision is a specific LEA function. We shall have to consider the position of part-time nursery education.<br><br>
Perhaps we need to table a further amendment to take account of nursery education, especially part-time nursery education which is carried out by some grant-maintained schools as agents for the LEA. Many of my colleagues and friends attest that many LEAs—mainly Conservative controlled—do not use the element of the standard spending assessment provided by government for nursery education for that purpose. If the funding agency takes over the LEAs' responsibility for providing nursery education, how will the SSA funds that an LEA usually receives be transferred to the funding agency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to all of us if the Minister explained the current arrangements. If a school that at present provides nursery education opts out, does its responsibility for nursery education continue? Is the money transferred from the local education authority to the grant-maintained school? If so, does the Minister intend that to be the arrangement in future? It would be helpful to know the current, let alone the future, arrangements.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that that issue must be explored. I shall not speculate further on the issue in the hope that, in response to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), the Minister will explain the arrangements.<br><br>
Since the announcement of next year's support from central Government to local government and the publication of the standard spending assessments, many local authorities have already said that they are seriously considering the closure of all their nurseries. One example is the borough of Harrow, not far from this place. Although I have not had much to do with that borough, it seems to have been making a pretty reasonable job of providing education. There is a dispute between the borough, the Department of the Environment and the Department for Education over the removal of the money that Harrow used to spend on further education, because the further education sector is being transferred out of local authority control. Harrow believe that the Government have taken £7 million more than it ought to have done. The borough is seriously considering ending its nursery provision because it is not statutory. If they were to do that, could a nursery school apply for grant-maintained status? I assume that it could, because, under the 1944 Act, the duty of providing primary education vested in the local authority automatically
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
covers nursery schools that are separate and free-standing institutions. Some nursery schools may therefore apply for grant-maintained status.<br><br>
Where provision is made within primary schools—or first schools, as Harrow has—it may be lost. The Harrow education authority spends both the money raised by the poll tax and that given for running its services by the Government on schools. If it were responsible for nursery provision, how would the funding authority determine how the money was to be spent? Would Harrow, for example, have to decide how money was to be distributed between LEA and grant-maintained schools? Would there be a further sophistication of the formula to take more money from the local authority pot to put into the grant-maintained pot, to continue nursery education through the funding agency?<br><br>
At present, there is a national policy for the local provision of education to children aged five to 16. Nursery education, however, is delivered locally and funded by central Government at a different level for each authority. There is no national policy and no statutory backing for the money that the Government provides to each LEA for nursery education. Many authorities do not use the money for that purpose. Some Labour authorities, however, use the money that the Government provides and also raise money locally to ensure that their nursery provision is as good as possible and that there are sufficient places.<br><br>
If the amendment is not accepted, the funding agency's policy for the provision of nursery education in grant-maintained schools may be different from that of LEAs. The funding agency could develop its own national policy for the provision of nursery education, although I would want legal clarification of that assumption. Alternatively, it could examine the policy in each LEA, up to the point at which it takes over, and continue to provide at that level. It is, however, possible that the funding agency may not have any such authority and LEAs will continue to be responsible for nursery education.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 83 and 105 would ensure that the LEA retained a clear responsibility to provide nursery education. Perhaps it is time for the Government to consider extending statutory provision for education to the age of three.<br><br>
As many of my hon. Friends have said, well-provided nursery education can be a tremendous stimulus to a child's future career, in school and beyond.<br><br>
As a member of the Select Committee that did a study on nursery provision, I believe that it is absolutely essential that we ensure that nursery provision is quality provision. There is always the danger that in the years from rising-two to five, the pre-school provision may be little more than child minding. The DFE should re-examine the sector and think seriously about improving its performance to ensure that good quality nursery education is provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman talk about providing for "rising-twos"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I did say rising-twos because that was the experience of several of my younger brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because there are plenty of reasons to prove that pre-school provision from rising-two is useful for children. I was not suggesting that the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
should introduce a statutory duty for LEAs to provide from rising-two—rising-three might be more appropriate. Nursery education is of fundamental importance to children's lives, particularly those whose home backgrounds do not provide them with the wealth of experience that many other children are fortunate to acquire. Some children come from homes where books are unknown and where lengthy conversation in the family is infrequent; often they are not taken to places—things and experiences which many of us take for granted.<br><br>
The formula for nursery provision is weighted towards areas of deprivation. In some inner-city areas, the Government have other programmes that enable the LEA—or other agencies—to provide pre-school education. The Government have already accepted that need.<br><br>
All that I should like clarified is what the Government think that the role of the LEA, the funding agency and the funding council in Wales will be in the provision of nursery education in grant-maintained schools before the 10 per cent. trigger has created an LEA-wide joint responsibility with the funding agency and after the 75 per cent. trigger, when the funding agency may be in full control. In the shared period, or before it, will there be any legal difference between the provision of full-time and part-time nursery education? We hope that the amendments have been useful in raising the question of the legal position of nursery education under the new regime envisaged in the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can say straight away that the Government do not intend that the duty of the funding agency or of the schools funding council for Wales to secure sufficient school places should include a duty to secure nursery places. The LEA's duty under section 8 of the Education Act 1944, to which the duty of the funding authority is linked in paragraph 3(3) and (5) of schedule 2, does not include a duty to secure sufficient nursery places. I refer to section 24(2) of the Education Act 1980, and I can assure Opposition Members of the Committee that it is not the intention that the funding agency or the funding council should cover nursery education. However, if on further reflection we believe that that may be the case, we shall return to it at a later stage. I ask that the Committee reject amendment No. 83, on the grounds that it is unnecessary and otiose.<br><br>
It may surprise Opposition members of the Committee that I shall recommend that amendment No. 105 be accepted, as we have been persuaded by the arguments that have been made. I invite the Opposition to withdraw the amendment on the firm undertaking that I shall return to the matter, to give effect to its meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one question about the first statement that the Minister made about the local education authority being responsible for nursery education. Does the Minister foresee that in future the money provided under the standard spending assessment for nursery education might lead to statutory provision up to the level of that funding, or will the LEA still be able to decide how to spend that money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prejudge unnecessarily the consultation documents that will be published shortly, but I expect the position to remain broadly as it is.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
To answer the hon. Member for Bath, if a school with full-time nursery provision becomes grant-maintained it will be funded in total by the funding agency for schools. That will not be so if the school offers only part-time provision.<br><br>
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee to reject amendment No. 83 on the grounds that it is not necessary. I hope, too, that amendment No. 105 will be withdrawn on my firm undertaking to return at a later stage to give proper effect to the amendment's intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Bridget Prentice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr. Martin, and for the change in salutation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I preferred the other one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can discuss that at another time.<br><br>
We have had a good and comprehensive debate in which many contributions have exposed the great need for quality nursery education to be provided by local education authorities rather than the funding agency. I accept the Minister's assurances on amendment No. 105, although I am disappointed that he considered amendment No. 83 to be unnecessary and said that it should be rejected. The two amendments go hand in hand—I was about to say that they were parallel but, given the definition of that word which was offered earlier, that seems to be dangerous ground.<br><br>
It is important to re-emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, who said that when cuts are made in local authority spending, as they have been consistently under this Government, invariably they are made in nursery provision. That is particularly unfortunate, given the importance of nurseries in the overall enhancement of schooling. I remind the Committee that the latest study, which was carried out by the university of Leeds, showed that children who had been to nursery school did significantly better in English and maths at key stage 1. Conservative members of the Committee should bear that in mind when we discuss nursery provision.<br><br>
Because of our relationship with our European competitors, it is important that we put nursery provision high on the agenda and that we are committed to it. I welcome the Minister's willingness to reconsider the matter. It is interesting that France, Belgium and our other European partners provide high-quality nursery education, that they manage to keep their young people in education longer than we do and that those young people gain better qualifications than our older teenagers. Perhaps there is a correlation between nursery provision and the staying-on rate at the other end of school life.<br><br>
If local education authorities are to be given responsibility for nursery provision, they will require appropriate funding. It is unfortunate that in some Conservative-controlled authorities, such as those cited by my hon. Friend, the SSA for nursery provision has not been used for that purpose. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) tells me that more than 3,000 places should be provided for children in his area but are not, because the Conservative authority does not spend to the SSA. Those children will suffer not only now, but for years to come, as a result of that decision.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) developed the argument for nursery education in the early years of schooling and in later years. A quality education from the age of three or four develops a child throughout its primary and secondary education. She pointed out an important factor that is emphasised by the amendments—the relationship between the education authority and other social and health services. The amendments would ensure that the education authority, as the agent of nursery education, would continue that relationship with the other authorities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth gave us an illuminating description of how young people learn, from maypoles to Pythagoras and the Jesuits. I am sure that we all learned a great deal from his contribution. He emphasised the need to ensure that funding is available and that the quality of the education and training of those who teach young people is enhanced. We want that to be part of the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport explained that the funding agency will not be able to meet the need adequately, particularly while nursery provision is not a statutory service. The funding agency will inevitably provide only what it is statutorily obliged to provide. He pointed out the demand for nursery education from those who could not afford any alternative. He argued that the ability of a young person who has been through nursery education is clearly enhanced by that experience and that that is shown throughout school life.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) explained the situation in Wales and the way in which a long-established tradition of nursery provision has led to the outstanding development of education in Wales. The figures that he quoted showed how greatly young people in Wales have benefited.<br><br>
I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to reconsider this matter and will accept amendment No. 105. However, I am disappointed that he is not prepared to accept amendment No. 83 in the same spirit. He says that it is unnecessary, so I shall take him at his word and hope that he will take our views into account. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 3, line 28, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and may relate to the whole of a local education authority area or part thereof.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 140, in page 3, line 30, after 'area', insert 'or part thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are using the amendment to determine whether the Government have been honest in their protestations. They say that they want the system to work flexibly and in a spirit of co-operation. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the discretion to declare that only part of the local education authority area will be covered by the funding agency rather than to extend the geographical area of activity of the funding authority so that it is coterminous with that of the local authority.<br><br>
The amendment has been tabled in the genuine hope that the Minister will accept its validity for existing practice and for the spirit of the Government's intentions. Opposition Members are still unclear about the relevant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
responsibilities of the LEA and the funding authority. There is considerable confusion about the overlapping powers. Nevertheless, the Minister claims that it is clear and that there will be a co-operative regime. He said that LEAs will have a more strategic planning role in partnership with funding authorities. He talked of his abhorrence of monopoly structures. That runs counter to the proposal for a monopoly structure if 75 per cent. of pupils are at grant-maintained schools. The Minister saw no need for monopoly structures, so I assume that he accepts that there will be overlapping and not simply parallel responsibilities for those two bodies.<br><br>
There is further confusion over the role of the Secretary of State who will still have considerable powers—even absolute powers. The amendment tests the Government's true intentions on the role of the funding authority. Local authorities are responsible for providing school places, and planning schools closures, and they may establish new schools. That is not done on a local-authority-wide basis because the travel patterns of pupils do not necessarily coincide with the authority's geographical area.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The county of Mid Glamorgan could be divided into several unitary authorities. In order to devolve decision-making, Mid Glamorgan has a district structure for its education provision. Hypothetically, one district could place the authority in a position where 10 per cent. of schools had become grant maintained. Yet the rest of the county would remain untouched in the district structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Mid Glamorgan is a good example. The amendments may seem most appropriate to counties in which districts are far apart. The amendment would also have ramifications for smaller, tight-knit urban areas, such as the constituency that I represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked my researcher to examine the problem—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Researcher?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to pay for my researcher. Is my hon. Friend aware that in Cumbria—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She says. Cumbria is a vast county. In Carlisle and Penrith, in the north-east of the county, there are three secondary schools, two grant-maintained primary schools and three primary schools that have held positive ballots for grant-maintained status. Yet in Workington, Maryport and Whitehaven, no schools have held a ballot. In one part of Cumbria, several schools have opted out; in another part, no schools have attempted a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and his researcher. There are many reasons why geography can have a strong impact on parents' attitudes towards opting out. I know that Cumbria is a far-sighted Labour-controlled authority. However, Trafford has been dominated by the Conservative party since 1974, when local government was reorganised. There is a feeling that the borough had a policy, deliberate or otherwise, of favouring the southern Tory-voting part at the expense of the poorer north, the part where I grew up and which I represent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
Its policy of underfunding education has been politically divisive and has been usd for that end. I have made that charge on many occasions so it will come as no surprise to anybody. Such political manipulation, which we tend to associate—I am afraid to say—with Tory local authorities, creates a sense of geographical disadvantage, which could lead to different rates of opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that in many areas covered by one LEA since re-organisation some years ago, there is no affinity between different geographical parts of that LEA? Those parts were pushed together, often creating a lot of resentment. Does he agree that if one of those areas was forced into being run by the funding agency as a result of votes in another part of the authority, it could cause further resentment and lead to deteriorating relations and more friction within LEAs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I shall take her prompt to talk about specific examples. In Greater Manchester some local authorities were cobbled together in the way that my hon. Friend described, for example a local authority in my area. Stretford council, before re-organisation, was an accepted district and was in effect its own education authority. It became part of a local authority with other parts of south-west Greater Manchester. Differences of attitude and orientation emerged, which are revealed in the diverse voting patterns within that borough.<br><br>
There are more extreme cases in Greater Manchester, such as Bolton. The best example is Tameside where there are seven historic towns, all of which have a community feeling, and among which there is a strong, generally healthy, rivalry. They were brought together under one local authority. However should pressure build up for schools to opt out in particular parts of that authority, it would be inconceivable that people in Denton, for example, would welcome interventions from a funding agency whose responsibility was based in Ashton or any other parts of Tameside.<br><br>
In county areas that situation is more overt. We know that large geographical areas can be covered. Authorities do not assess the movements of children and young people and do not plan on an authority-wide basis, because such planning is inappropriate. Earlier my hon. Friend mentioned the situation in Mid-Glamorgan and rightly pointed out that planning occurs de facto at a regional level within the county. In the other local authority in my area, City of Manchester, such planning would be inappropriate. I spoke to the chief education officer and that authority today. He said that it would be inappropriate to try to plan for young people in schools in Wythenshawe at the same time as planning for people in north Manchester. The role of the LEA must be to iron out the boundary disputes that would arise as a result of such regionalised planning within one authority. It is necessary to plan at a lower level than an LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed some of my hon. Friend's comments. Planning below local authority level is exemplified in Mid Glamorgan where, apart from having a district organisation for education, an attempt has been made to provide certain types of school within the district. Except for highly specialised provision, special education schools and units are not planned across the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
county. Each area or sub-region within the education authority is examined and needs are provided for as locally as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It make sense that LEAs plan on that basis. No Opposition Member would dispute that the local authority has that global planning role across all its area. However, the essential point is that planning for the duty to provide sufficient school places, which the funding authority will take over, takes place below the authority-wide level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is describing the great in-depth planning involved in attempting to provide a county-wide service in which provision is tailored as closely as possible to local needs, does he not consider that the Minister's earlier comments about the way in which the funding agency will be staffed in the main by section 1 civil servants of the DFE to be rather depressing and even wrong-headed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made another important point. Opposition Members fear that, in effect, the funding authority will be Whitehall telling local communities how to behave. That would be bad enough at the level of LEA-style planning. However, the idea that decentralised and locally geared planning could be carried out by the civil servants who will be drafted in to do it—and whom I do not criticise—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nor should you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says, nor should I. Opposition Members generally support the high-quality work of civil servants. We do not rubbish what they do by saying that their work should be put out to outside agencies on the ground that privatisation will make massive increases in efficiency. Nor was it Opposition Members who, during the fairly recent discussions about the then publicly owned skill centres, gave undertakings to the civil servants employed by those centres that their terms and conditions of work would be maintained. The result, several years later, was that the then privatised Astra organisation undermined and reneged on those promises. I do not think that we need lessons from the Minister, who is currying favour with his researchers by saying that I should not criticise civil servants. I have no ambition or intention to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend has touched on an important aspect of the workings of the funding agency. There is no criticism of section 1 civil servants in the Department for Education. They are doing a specific job at a national level. However, although the funding agency will be a national body, it will be doing a job at a local level. In the bigger local authorities, the district level must also be considered. The work that DFE civil servants will have to handle will be so different in character from their present work that, although they may rise to the challenge, it is not a fair burden.</span></p>
