	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Bail (Amendment) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Stephen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That if the proceedings on the Bail (Amendment) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q>
I introduced the Bill because my constituents and, I am sure, those of all other hon. Members are seriously concerned about offences committed by persons on bail. In any constituency, one finds on inquiring that those offences are committed by a small group—usually of young men—who, having been arrested and let out on bail by magistrates, re-offend time and time again before their trial for the original offence. It is not unknown for one young man to have committed more than 200 offences before he reaches the age of 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of those offences relate to burglary and car crime. Statistics are hard to find, but Northumbria police has done valuable work in this area under the supervision of Professor Openshaw of Newcastle university. I wish to acknowledge their contribution to this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1989, Northumbria police has kept records of offences committed on bail and it has found that in case of theft or the taking of a motor vehicle, 44.6 per cent. of detected crimes are committed by a person on bail. In the case of house burglaries the situation is worse, with 53.5 per cent. of all detected crimes committed by a person on bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman make a short statement because we do not want a Second Reading debate in Committee. Two minutes have gone by, so could he bring his remarks to a close?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down I should like to pay tribute to the parents of Anna McGurk, a young woman who was raped and murdered in Gloucester by a man who had been arrested for rape and let out on bail by magistrates. I am grateful to her parents, Kay and Jim Potts, for the support that they have given me. I am also grateful for the support that I have received from the hon. Members of all parties who have signed my early-day motion 1134.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be of assistance to the Committee if I state that I believe that there is considerable all-party support for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Shoreham (Mr. Stephen) on his success on reaching the Committee stage, which provides hon. Members with an opportunity to debate the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the sittings motion and the time which may be needed by the Committee, it would be helpful to hear from the Minister about the Government's approach
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
to the Bill, because, as the hon. Member for Shoreham stated, the Bill has not been debated in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could I ask the Minister—I am sure, Mr. Hill, that you would wish him to be succinct—about the Government's approach to the Bill and to the other actions that would be necessary to make the Bill and the bail system effective? That is, I am sure, what we all want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had understood from the selection of amendments that other new clauses would be selected other than new clause 4 which is grouped with amendment No. 11, but I now understand that that is not so. Some of those new clauses relate to the responsibilities of Ministers, which, if undertaken, would help to make the Bill, in whatever amended form the Committee agrees to, effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why any member of the Committee cannot intervene now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) puts forward a pertinent point, but he has answered his own question: we are in Committee today to discuss and to listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>"That, if the proceedings on the Bail (Amendment) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half past Ten o'clock.".</p></q></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROSECUTION OF RIGHT OF APPEAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 to 9 would remove the words which restrict the right of appeal to the decisions of magistrates and apply it also to the decisions of Crown courts in bail cases. I believe that that would be a desirable amendment because, although much rarer, mistakes in bail cases do occur in Crown courts. I have, however, taken the advice of experienced colleagues who have rightly pointed out that if one seeks to achieve too much in a private Members' Bill one may achieve nothing in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10, which is grouped with amendment No. 13, would specify the courts to which appeals would lie for magistrates and Crown Courts. However, in view of what I have said about the Crown Courts, I am content with the existing wording of clause 1(1) which provides that appeals should lie with a judge of the High Court or a Crown Court. Therefore I do not intend to move amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 6, after "with", insert "or convicted of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After conviction, magistrates may remand a defendant for reports or other reasons and they may decide to remand that person on bail. If the prosecution is to have a right of appeal when bail is granted to a person who is charged, there is an even stronger case for it to have a right of appeal after that person has been convicted but before he has been sentenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 1, line 7, after "more", insert
	<br><q><p>"or an offence of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, and it is alleged by the prosecution that there is a risk to the public of serious harm if bail is granted".</p></q>
I hope that the Committee will be business-like to enable the hon. Member for Shoreham to return to the House with an improved and effective Bill. Amendment No. 16 is especially important in that regard. Clause 1 applies to offences punishable by a term of imprisonment of five years or more. That sounds perfectly reasonable as a starting point, until two things are realised. First, less serious offences would be caught by that requirement. For instance, the theft of a milk bottle is technically an offence that falls within the clause. I am sure that hon. Members would agree that the theft of a milk bottle even if repeated and further offences were committed by the accused while on bail, is not a crime of the seriousness of others for which the Bill is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the offence of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent does not carry a penalty of five years or more and therefore would not be caught by the Bill. Theft of a motor vehicle would be covered, but to prosecute successfully for theft, the prosecuting counsel would have to prove an intention permanently to deprive the owner of the vehicle. Because of the difficulty of proving that, the charge of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent is the charge more normally brought in cases related to the serious business of death riding. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that death riding is a more appropriate term than joy riding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, offences of taking without the owner's consent, even if they are not immediately dangerous or life threatening, are dangerous to the public because the person who takes a vehicle does not have insurance. If an accident occurs, a person can be injured, maimed for life or can lose property for which there is no recompense. I know that the hon. Member for Shoreham takes that offence seriously and amendment No. 16 allows for it to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is balanced by ensuring that the prosecution needs to allege that there would be a risk of serious harm to the public if bail were granted. By providing a proper safeguard, the amendment would tighten the clause and make it more effective. Hon. Members may question the use of the term "alleged" rather than "proved". If risk to the public had to be proved before there could be a right of appeal, it would place an onerous restriction on the clause and that is not my aim. Obviously, if the prosecution felt that there were a serious risk, it would need to allege it. The matter would then be raised on appeal in the appropriate court, where the right weight would be given to evidence of likely further offending and any risk to the public. The need to allege would not obstruct the application of the clause in circumstances in which the police and the prosecution felt that the granting of bail was likely to lead to the type of problems to which the hon. Member for Shoreham referred earlier. Therefore, it would allow action on issues which have—I agree with the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks—caused the public and the police grave concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will be seen as a constructive contribution towards achieving fair and,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
effective legislation, which will assist the courts and the criminal justice system generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the points made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I have given considerable thought to his amendment. It is right that we should pay particular attention to the offence of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent because, all too often, a young man takes a motor car, drives through the streets in a furious manner and sometimes injures or kills people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendment singles out that offence as one to be added to the general category of offences that carry a term of imprisonment of more than five years, making it an offence on which the prosecution would have a right of appeal. On reflection, we may find that other offences should be included in that category. I do not wish to single out one offence and omit others. Between now and Third Reading, we should consider how to amend the clause, which restricts the type of offence for which a right of appeal exists, to include the offence mentioned in amendment No. 16 and other offences that fall into the same category, rather than accept the amendment. Would the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth consider withdrawing the amendment in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 16 in general. First, I declare an interest in that I am the parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham on introducing a Bill to address one of today's most important issues. It is especially appropriate that the issue be dealt with by a private Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sympathy for the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth is generated by the tremendous problem caused to the public by what is known to the police as TWOC—taking without the owner's consent. He is right to draw attention to the problem, because members of the public are injured or killed as a result of cars being taken without the owner's consent and being raced and driven at high speeds through towns and cities. I very much hope that, on reflection, my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham will find a way to accept the amendment, or something like it. I welcome his offer to consider other offences which may come within the ambit of the Bill, but do not carry a sentence of five years' imprisonment. The whole problem of granting bail in magistrates courts needs urgently addressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The granting of bail to young men who constantly re-offend is known in the police as the revolving door syndrome. An individual is arrested, charged with an offence and then granted police bail. By the time that offence comes before the court, a period of some six months might have elapsed, during which the young person concerned will probably have committed numerous further offences, including burglary, which is now a major scourge of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember visiting the west midlands a couple of years ago and being told of one particular youngster who had been charged with taking vehicles without consent. When
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
his case came to court, he was put on probation and he asked for 115 other cases to be taken into consideration. A couple of hours later, he was arrested again for committing the same type of offence. It is right that the Bill should address the problem and that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth should be given most serious consideration by the promoter of the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham in his wish to reflect on the matter, but I hope that he will give a firm indication of his view and that the Minister will also say that Parliament will take this opportunity to deal with the problem. It is not something that should be put aside, pending further legislation sponsored by the Government. It is a matter that should be dealt with by Parliament as soon as it is practical to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, said when he moved the amendment and the undertaking given by my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham—that he will use the time available to reflect on the matter. I hope that he will accept an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Dudley Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwick and Leamington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) has said. I also support the thrust of amendment No. 16. It is one of the great scandals of our time that we have allowed the situation on bail to get to where it is, particularly in relation to young offenders who need curbing and who create mayhem, and often kill with cars. The public believe that Parliament should act to circumscribe such activities. Indeed, they believe that we should have acted a long time ago. They do not appreciate the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I too hope that the Minister will agree that we should extend the proposal to other categories of crime. We all know of cases where young villains have been allowed out on bail and have gone on to commit further offences. In recent years, there has been an era of extending bail because of the difficulties of locking up those on remand and the pressures on our prison system and on police cells. We should not use that as an excuse. If we need more accommodation for people who commit offences, it has to be provided because the protection of the public is paramount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend see the dark hand of the Treasury intervening in the matter and, perhaps, in relation to clause 2? Does he agree that, very often, if a proposal that would lead to greater levels of incarceration is put forward, the advice given to Ministers is that it would not get through the Treasury? Is not that another dimension to the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. We see the dark hand of the Treasury in many respects. It has a job to do, and it is a necessary job, but there are issues, and this is one of them, where the protection of the public is paramount. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham has done such a good service in bringing in the Bill. Although its scope is modest, it is relevant to the times. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to support the proposal, having taken into consideration the Treasury and other factors.

We do not want to become a draconian society that locks up everybody. There are many cases in which bail is appropriate or in which the benefit of the doubt should be given to the individual who has been charged, but we all know of many cases in which blatant villains are allowed out. That reduces the credibility of Parliament and Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reassure my hon. Friend and other hon. Members that we are showing our concern by our work in the bail study information groups in five magistrates courts areas which, for the reasons underlined by hon. Members, are looking in depth at the way in which bail decisions are made. That work is designed to improve the quality of the bail decision-making process and thus to address the questions of risk that were reflected in my hon. Friend's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that assurance and I hope that the work he mentioned will be completed as quickly as possible. All of us here who give the Bill their good will are trying to retain the confidence of the public by doing the right thing. If we can retain their confidence and that of the police, we shall take a big step forward. At the moment, there is a lack of confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the promoter of the Bill on this issue. The only disagreement that I have with the comments that have been made concerns whether it is appropriate to deal with the matter in a private Member's Bill. It is being dealt with in this way because it was not tackled in the Criminal Justice Bill, which is going into Committee. It is sad that that opportunity was not taken by the Government. However, we now have an opportunity, created through the private Members Bill system, and we should seize it to try to get the right piece of legislation through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comment made by the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Sir Dudley Smith) that we do not want to lock everybody up. We want to ensure that the right people are refused bail and that people are not locked up when that may be inappropriate. That is why the amendment is so important. The question was asked: why does the amendment cover only car-related offences? That is easily answered. Between 1989 and 1992, thefts of cars increased by 45 per cent. There was an associated increase of some 48 per cent. in thefts from cars, giving a total vehicle-crime increase of 47 per cent. But clearly the most serious crime is the taking of vehicles because of its implications for public safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty eight per cent. of all crimes recorded by the police in the year ending June 1992 were vehicle-related offences. That shows how important it is to deal with them and there is considerable evidence of repeated offending in this area. In terms of their bulk, danger and damage to the public, the two most important offences that need to be dealt with are car-related offences and burglary. The burglary element is covered by the clause, but one wants to ensure that the right people—those who are putting the public in danger—are locked up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Shoreham said that there might be other offences that ought to come into this category. I suggest that those offences do not present the bulk of the problem, as evidenced by the police and by the statistics.

Yesterday, in the all-party group on penal affairs, we heard how seriously the problem is viewed by representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The hon. Member for Shoreham referred to some of the information that they gave. That is why the amendment is particularly serious and appropriate. I take his point, however, that there may be other offences that ought to be considered. If that is the case and if there is evidence, that matter could be addressed on Report. I urge him, especially in the light of the sympathy that he expressed for this amendment, and the support indicated by other members of the Committee, to accept this amendment at this state. That is what the Committee wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still plenty of time between now and Report for further amendment to be made and for the might and wisdom of the Home Office and the Law Officers to be brought to bear on the Bill to ensure that practical and effective legislation is achieved. I urge the promoter of the Bill to accept the amendment, as it does not close the door at this stage but would give a clear indication of what the Committee, in supporting his initiative, wishes to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth for what he has said and also for the support expressed by other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference between us on substance. I wholly support what the hon. Member is trying to do. My only thought was that, procedurally, it might be better if we were to make one amendment. I take his point, however, that, if in the time between now and Third Reading, we discover that other offences ought to be included, we will have the opportunity to table an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member is not inclined to withdraw his amendment, I am happy to say that I accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for that, as it illustrates a good cross-party spirit in dealing with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<br><q><p>"failing which the prosecution appeal shall be null and void".</p></q>
Members of the Committee will appreciate that there is a danger, which is seen by those concerned with maintenance of civil liberties that, under the Bill as it stands, it will be possible for the prosecution to indicate an intention of entering an appeal but then not put in the notice and go through the process properly. We can all understand the danger of that, however rare an occurrence it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, if the prosecution were not to follow through the verbal intention of appealing, the appeal would immediately fall and the person would be restored to liberty immediately. The Bill may not be perfect in its wording, but I think that its intention is clear. I hope that the amendment will improve it by ensuring that there is protection for individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given some thought to the amendment. The reason that I have provided in the Bill that written notice should be given is that it should be done by way of confirmation only of the oral notice of appeal that had already been given in open court under clause 1(2)(a). That oral notice of appeal would have been given in open court in the presence of the defendant and would constitute the commencement of the appeal process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have practised in the magistrates court and I am conscious that, on a very busy day, that process may not be possible. Perhaps the confirmation of the notice of appeal in writing is not given within the time limit by inadvertence. If the prosecuting officer turns up at the magistrates clerks office, perhaps ten minutes late, I do not want him to be told, "I am sorry, you are too late; we have let the defendant go." I would not wish to see failure to comply with what is, essentially, a procedural matter affect the appeal process itself, which had been set in train by the oral notice of appeal having been given. I am not, therefore, in a position to accept the amendment and would invite the Committee not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can be helpful, as I do not want to divide the Committee unnecessarily. I take the point made by the hon. Member that one would not want a bureaucratic requirement to obstruct the intentions of the legislation. On the other hand, I think that he would accept that the fact that a court is busy can lead also to inadvertent mistakes the other way round. It would be possible, for instance, for someone to be locked up inadvertently for five days as a result of inappropriate action, which would not be the intention of the promoter or the Committee. Does the hon. Member for Shoreham accept my point, if not the nature of the amendment? It could be considered between now and Report and some way found of ensuring that there is no possibility of a process being started verbally and not carried through properly, resulting in someone inappropriately losing their liberty, perhaps for a serious length of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there would be any possibility of someone being locked up by inadvertence. In order to start the appeal process, the prosecuting officer must consider whether he wishes to make an appeal. He must declare his intention by making a statement in open court under clause 1(2)(a) at the conclusion of the proceedings in which the bail was granted and before the release from custody of the person concerned. There is a formal public act to be made before the person is to be kept in custody. I would not, as I have said, wish the simple confirmatory process of written notice to nullify the appeal, and so, despite listening carefully to what the hon. Member has said, I must still invite the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I retain my concern on this issue although I understand why the hon. Member is unwilling to accept the amendment as it stands. The most helpful thing that I could do at this stage is to seek leave to withdraw the amendment in order to study the matter further in the hope that we can return to it, perhaps in a more considered way, on Report. In the meantime I might be able to persuade the hon. Member for Shoreham of the seriousness of the issue that I have raised.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on, I announce a small change in the selection of Amendments; I now propose to call Mr. Michael to speak to his amendment No. 13 when we come to the appropriate part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 1, line 25, leave out "five days" and insert "forty-eight hours".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this amendment will be considered helpful. The power that we are giving to the courts and to the prosecution is a serious one and I am sure that members of the Committee would agree that somebody should be locked up only for a minimum period before the correctness of that decision is tested and considered by a court or by a judge. I believe that the period of five days is too onerous a period of time to pass without such consideration, especially as that might well be extended by the weekend and by holidays of the courts and bank holidays. Because my amendment does not remove the additional days, it is surely not to onerous to ask that 48 hours becomes the time limit, rather than five days. I hope this will be seen as a constructive amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is indeed a constructive amendment. I have reflected at length and borne in mind the need to get on with appeals as quickly as possible, so that if the judge hearing an appeal concludes that the magistrates were right to grant bail, the person concerned can be released as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also borne in mind our obligations under the European convention on human rights and I have no difficulty in accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take new clause 4—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Powers to grant or refuse bail and to adjourn</i></p>
	<p>"In respect of this Act, the court or judge in Chambers shall have the power to grant or to refuse bail, to adjourn for the provision of further information by the prosecution or the defence, or through any local bail information scheme, or to grant bail subject to conditions which may include specific reference to complying with requirements of any local bail support and enforcement scheme.".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 11 is simple and tells the Appeal Court what it may and may not do. It provides that a court hearing an appeal by the prosecution against a bail decision may remand that person in custody or grant bail, subject to any conditions it thinks fit. New clause 4 seeks essentially to do the same thing and was tabled before the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth had seen my amendment. The only difference is that his amendment would give the court the power to adjourn. I do not think that that is necessary because, as I understand it, under the present law and rules of court, a judge has the power to adjourn his court when he thinks fit. That power may be exercised in appropriate cases,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
although I do not wish to encourage it to be exercised often because—I am sure the Committee agrees—the essence of this procedure is speed. Whether a person can have bail should be determined at the earliest possible moment. In the fight of my tabling amendment No. 11, I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider not moving new clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we are clearly looking at the same issues and that they are important. I take the point that if the power to adjourn exists without its being specified in the legislation—not being a lawyer, I have to take the hon. Gentleman's word on that—the main intention of my amendment is dealt with. However, the intention also was to make it clear—I think this echoes earlier comments of Conservative Members—that we should not be seeking to maximise the number of people who are locked up. Rather we should be looking for ways to make bail work so that people on bail do not offend. That is preferable to locking people up and it is something that both sides of the Committee would generally agree on. That is why the new clause includes the proposition that adjournments should seek positively to obtain information which might assist the court, and a specific reference to the possibility of the requirements of the local bail support and enforcement scheme being pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his brief intervention, referred to the need to do more to improve the quality of information that is available to the courts. It is also necessary to intervene more to make bail more effective and to make it more difficult for people to disregard bail requirements. That would ensure that people do not lose their liberty and avoids greater expense on the public purse—two matters that have to be balanced against the need to protect the public. It is in that spirit that I tabled the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two of the other new clauses I tabled also seek to address that issue. For example, the speeding up of court procedures can minimise the amount of time that a person is on bail and therefore able to commit offences while on bail before the court reaches its decision, which is intended to have some effect on his behaviour in future. It also cuts the amount of time—if bail is refused—a person is held in custody and the consequent cost, as well as loss of liberty. There are important issues here.

Amendment No. 11 deals with the most important part of new clause 4. Therefore, in the hope that some of these matters will be dealt with on Report, I shall not move, at the appropriate time, that the new clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"by a court or a judge in chambers".</p></q>
I hope to be brief. The amendment ties in with the aim of amendment No. 14, which the Committee has approved, and is intended to minimise delay. I tabled the amendment after looking at the nature of the problems, but the matter may already be covered in the rules and legislation governing the procedures of the court, which

allow this point to be dealt with. If that is not the case, it seems sensible that the matter should be made explicit in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 13 is constructive and provides that the appeal might be heard by a court or a judge in chambers. I think it best if the issue is left to the rules of the Crown court, which already provide that bail cases are heard by judges in chambers. The hon. Gentleman may be content with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of that comment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the commencement of our proceedings, the Bill is designed to put right mistakes that are sometimes made by magistrates courts in deciding the difficult and important question of whether the persons before them should be granted bail. I referred briefly to the high incidence of offending on bail, especially in cases of house burglaries, theft and the taking of vehicles. I referred to the excellent work that has been done in that respect by the Northumbria police. I am aware of the comments of the research and planning unit of the Home Office on the Northumbria survey, which suggest that there is a lower incidence of offending on bail than the survey shows. However, the Home Office report does not take into account cases in which an offender has admitted an offence to the police and has been dealt with by way of caution rather than charge, offences that are admitted to the police and taken into consideration by a court sentencing for another offence and cases in which a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for another offence sees the police in prison and admits to an offence in respect of which he gives particulars to the police to verify that he committed it. I suggest that because the Home Office report does not take account of such cases, the report tends seriously to understate the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
House burglary is a very serious crime indeed. It is not merely a question of stealing property or of the vandalism that so often accompanies burglaries. House burglary does tremendous psychological damage, especially to women whose homes have been violated—sometimes to the extent that they feel that they can no longer live there. A high proportion of those dreadful crimes are committed against the poorest members of society who are often less well off than the burglar himself. Offences that are committed on bail also extend to the most serious of all, involving rape and murder. A moment ago I referred to the dreadful case of Anna McGurk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most grateful for the all-party support that the Bill has received I was surprised to find that support came from such diverse points of the political spectrum as the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) and my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). I am also extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister and his officials for their tremendous help over the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 would give the prosecution a right of appeal against a magistrates court's decision to grant bail against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
police objections. Under present law, all that the police can do is watch the man walk out of court. If my Bill were passed, they could appeal to a higher court and say, "No, the magistrates have made a mistake here. This man should be kept in custody pending his trial." The right of appeal is subject to the safeguards that are set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of clause 1. Members of the Committee may be aware that the Scots, who are ahead of us in so many respects, already have a prosecution right of appeal in bail cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were the Bill to be enacted, there would be a significant step forward in the fight against crime. However, that would only be the beginning. As has been mentioned, we need to ensure that there is adequate secure accommodation for persons who are remanded in custody. We also need to secure the question of bail information schemes, which have been mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I know that the Government are working hard on this issue and that they will introduce a computer database in 1995, if not earlier, which will give the courts instant access to the criminal records of persons before them. I hope that that database will also record that a person has been remanded on bail, so that any court before which he may appear in future will know that he was on bail at a material time. It may well be that the offence before the court was committed on bail. The court will be able to take that into account in deciding whether to grant bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sooner rather than later we must consider whether the police should be allowed to grant bail, subject to conditions. I welcome any progress on providing more information to magistrates. We are all agreed that we do not want the magistrates to make mistakes—we want them to make the correct bail decisions, and the more accurate and timely the information that they have, the more likely they are to get it right in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have practised in the courts, and I know that courts are human and that mistakes will inevitably be made. Therefore, it will remain necessary to have the right of appeal which the Bill provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the constructive way in which the promoter of the Bill and other members of the Committee have dealt with the clause. My only dissension is that the Government are not working hard enough on bail information schemes and, generally, on reducing the rate of offences—both home burglary and car-related offences, which have been referred to by the hon. Member for Shoreham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to sound one note of caution as we speed clause 1 on its way to the statute book clause 1 alone will not solve the problem, either of offending while on bail or of offending in general, especially in terms of the two important types of criminal behaviour mentioned by the hon. Member for Shoreham, and which I agree are the cause of massive public concern. On every visit that I make throughout the country, such concern is expressed when I speak to the police, the public or local authority representatives. For that reason, I am a little sad that certain new clauses will not be subject to discussion—to compliment clause 1, we must have comprehensive bail information systems so that all courts can make bail arrangements as effective as possible. Bail is not intended to catch out the person on bail, but to ensure that he does not offend while awaiting trial. We should aspire to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The Government should also do more to speed up the way in which prosecution takes place. That particular concern arises from the years that I spent as a magistrate dealing with juveniles. When I came to the House I was chairman of the juvenile Bench in the city of Cardiff. The whole process takes too long. If a person has a problem with his own child, the punishment takes place that day, not the following day or in several days' time. It is certainly not administered nine months later, by which time many young offenders have entirely forgotten for what offence they came before the court, and in which time offending behaviour could become confirmed. That is not in the interests of the public, the victims or, above all, of the young offender. Surely an important purpose of our criminal justice system is to divert and deflect young people in particular from becoming repetitive and serious offenders. For that reason, I tabled new clauses which I believed would balance the important provisions of clause 1. I do not want to delay the Bill by discussing those new clauses which you, Mr. Hill, in your wisdom, did not select. I hope that on Report, I shall be able to demonstrate more ingenuity by tabling new clauses that fall within the ambit of the Bill, which will enable them to be selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the motion that the clause stand part of the Bill, but I call on the Government and the Minister to have a greater sense of urgency about reducing crime so that the provisions of the clause will not have to be used too often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham on the informed way in which he dealt with the amendments and the new clause. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that it is a great advantage to have a lawyer dealing with these matters. His experience of practising in the courts is of great benefit to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's remarks about the scourge of burglary which concerns all our constitutents. Many people beleive that they cannot leave their homes, even for short periods or to go away on holiday, without having a house sitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important are the number of cases of aggravated offences, especially those in which elderly people are trussed up, beaten up and left in some cases, to die in their homes which have been broken into by people who violate the basic human right of every individual to live in peace in his or her home. Those matters are so serious that I strongly believe, as do the police, that the Government should lose no time in dealing with such crimes which, I am sorry to say, are on the increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that we face in society today is urbanisation. No one knows who lives in the same street. Villians are able to move easily from one part of the country to another using the motorway system which enables them to commit offences, It is difficult to secure their convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what has been said about the need for more secure accommodation. I have been parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation for four years, and I have travelled round the country speaking to the Police service, as we now call it. I have listened to members of the service
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
telling me at first-hand, about the lack of any secure accommodation in areas such as Wales, which is an area that springs immediately to mind. A story often told is that of a young person who has been sent by the court to a community home and who jumps out of the car at the first set of traffic lights. That person absconds before he even arrives at the home. It is well known that many young offenders abscond within hours, if not minutes of arriving at a community home. We need not only secure accommodation, but trained staff who are necessary to make the confinement of young people in secure accommodation a sensible and worthwhile exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham alluded to the need for magistrates to be informed about every aspect of the nature of the offence that has been committed and of the nature of the offender before them. I am concerned that magistrates are not fully informed about similar offences that have been committed by the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During a recent debate in the House, I cited numerous examples from one court of serious offenders, who had committed anything up to 50, 60 or 70 previous offences, being sentenced to a few hours of community service by the magistrates court because the magistrates were not aware that those offenders were professional burglars. The matter has been debated in the House and has attracted considerable publicity in the media. I believe that it can be dealt with only by a careful review of the way in which the Criminal Justice Act 1991 operates. There seems to be a considerable difference between the way in which the Act is supposed to operate and the way in which it actually operates at local level, in the magistrates courts. I know that the Minister is aware of that, and I hope that he and, indeed, the Home Secretary, will tell the House the outcome of their review of those difficult, but important matters. The Bill is an extremely worthwhile, if limited, change to the law, which should make a significant contribution to preventing reoffending while on bail. I strongly support the clause as amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although there is a general consensus of support for the Bill, we must make it clear to the police that we shall not take it lightly if they use the Bill to fill prisons or to gain another couple of days in which to obtain more evidence if they think that their case is weak. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Shoreham accepted an amendment to reduce the time limit from five days to 48 hours. I hope that that will dissuade the police from using the Bill to gain extra time. We must make it clear that we do not want prisons to fill up with more people on remand, not least for financial considerations.

We must also consider people's freedom. I still believe that people are innocent until proven guilty and we should not lose sight of that point. Although I know of people who continually reoffend, it does not always follow that they have committed the offence with which they are charged. Each case must be dealt with on its merits and we should not incarcerate people who should enjoy freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two hon. Members have said that they would support more secure accommodation. I am trying not to generalise, but I know from my experience of chairing a social services committee in Doncaster that some secure accommodation establishments are a breeding ground for people who reoffend. It is almost as if there is peer-group pressure on people to reoffend and to move on to the next
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
stage so that they gain so-called street credibility. The Government should put more money into providing intermediate treatment, especially for young offenders, so that we can get them out of the system before they get into it. If we bang up offenders in secure accommodation, it is possible that they will continue to reoffend and, because of peer-group pressure, that they will commit even more serious and harmful crimes. There is a case for more secure accommodation, but such accommodation should consist of small units because large units become breeding grounds for crime. Moorland prison and Lindholme prison are in my constituency, so I am familiar with that problem. More money should be provided for intermediate treatment so that young offenders can be taken out of the system before they become entrenched in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for everyone to have a right of appeal, but we should be cautious. I hope that we can debate that point in more detail on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham on introducing the Bill? It is long overdue and should plug an important gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer briefly to the problem of place of custody. We agree that there may be a crisis of accommodation for adults who are sent to prison. There is also insufficient secure accommodation throughout the country and that lack has become a crisis. I give the example from my constituency of a 14-year-old youth who has been charged 38 times, with 200 offences including burglary, taking cars, violence and drug trafficking to be taken into account. When he came to court, he was put into the hands of the social services. The court was told that no secure unit places were available in the country so he was put back into community care accommodation. He soon absconded and reoffended. He regards the whole exercise as a laughing matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) on one small detail. I shall visit the Orchard Lodge secure unit in south London next week. I agree that there should be proper counselling for young people, but I discovered that when the young man in my example spent three weeks there, he did not receive any counselling. That seems to be contrary to the planned arrangement and I want to see for myself what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Home Office grants to provide secure units are made through social services departments and it is for local authorities to take advantage of that, but some local authorities are ideologically opposed to such provision. The time has come to make such provision a statutory obligation. That matter is slightly aside from the main issue, but it is party to the point, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham, that reoffending while on bail is a national problem which must be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to deal with some of the points concerning bail in general and Government support, such as bail support schemes, to which the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth referred. In the previous financial year, we earmarked almost £1 million to expand such schemes and it is said that the money was not taken up as quickly as I should have liked. I assure the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that I shall do all that I can to encourage use of the available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Reference was made to bail information schemes. Some 166 magistrates courts and prisons are covered by those schemes and provision has been made in our spending plans for a further £5 million in the current financial year to extend those schemes to cover 220 courts. The volume of business that courts transact varies so it is important to prioritise the courts that require the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put those two points on the record as a clear indication of the importance that we attach to refining and further improving the operation of the bail scheme. I shall not trespass on the Committee's time by responding to the comments made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth about burglary, car-related offences and other offences save to say that I take them extremely seriously. He will know from many comments that we have exchanged on the subject elsewhere in the House that many initiatives are designed to deal with the matter. I am confident that we shall see the fruits of those labours, which will bear out some of the spot reductions in house burglary that have already occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should simply like to reply briefly to some of the points made, by the hon. Member for Doncaster, North. Throughout the criminal justice system there are opportunities for the unmeritorious use of the processes of the courts. When judges notice the abuses, they deal very severely with those guilty of them. I do not anticipate any wide-scale abuse of the right of appeal by the police or by the prosecuting authorities, but I have no doubt that judges who hear unmeritorious appeals will say so clearly and that the people concerned will be given a severe rap over the knuckles. I am sure that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the principal officers for all the other prosecuting authorities will bear in mind, as they do with regard to their existing powers, the need to use the new powers with discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the breeding ground for crime argument, I believe that the young offenders who are likely to be most often the subject of appeals under the legislation—usually young men aged between 17 and 21—are already well established in the art and practice of crime. They cannot learn a great deal from admission to any university of crime. Whatever may be the effect on them, we have a duty to our constituents, the law-abiding members of the public, to lock them up so that they cannot continue their criminal activities. By the time they reach that stage all other processes will have been tried. The probation service and local authority social services will have been involved. Community service will have been tried. All other forms of dealing with the offenders will have been tried. There are some criminals with whom we do not succeed. We have simply to lock them up to protect the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely pleased that my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary will shortly advance proposals for secure schools. Schooling is the important factor. If a young person has shown, by the commission of serious criminal offences, that his parents cannot or will not control him, we have a duty to him as well as to society to take him out of the negative home environment and to put him into a secure, but kind environment from which he cannot escape to commit further crimes and in which—this is important—he will receive education

	<div class='title'>PRESUMPTION IN RESPECT OF BAIL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause was intended to single out a particular category of offender—the offender who time and time again has committed serious offences while on bail. The clause would make it clear to such offenders that they had abused the trust implied by bail by committing offences while on bail and that, therefore, it would henceforth be for them to prove that they should have bail rather than for the police to prove that they should not. That is a perfectly proper way in which to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the measure has much support from hon. Members on both sides, but I have taken the advice of those who have been here longer than I have and who are experienced in the ways of the House. As I said, if one tries to achieve too much in a private Member's Bill, one may achieve nothing. Therefore, I shall not press the clause at this stage. I hope that the Government will include a similar clause in their Criminal Justice Bill; if they do not, I shall table an amendment to it along the lines of this clause. However, for the moment, I invite the Committee to reject the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sad that my hon. Friend feels the need to urge rejection of the clause, though I understand why. If he is to make progress, he is well advised to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems with which we are wrestling go back to the Bail Act 1976. That Act was passed two years after I had qualified as a solicitor and I had already been active in dealing with criminal offences before the magistrates courts. I noticed immediately, as anyone could have foretold, that the effect of the Bail Act was an absolute explosion in the instances of bail being granted in circumstances that a common-sense view would have held to be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in the House for 10 years and I have also practised criminal law for most of that time. I have seen the situation getting progressively worse, which needed no great foresight. In each Parliament in which I have served I have highlighted what has been happening. It is sad that it has taken a private Member's Bui to bring the matter to the attention of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is far too skilled a campaigner to reveal the advice of officials to the Minister in framing the Government's attitude to the Bill. I did not even embarrass my hon. Friend by asking him what the effect of that advice might be. However, even though memories grow dim, I can quietly speculate on the reception that the Bill would have had from officials who advise Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officials would have said first that the present system was an old British tradition, going as far back as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
1976, and that there would have to be a strong case to upset it. Then they would have said, "The time scale for a private Member's Bill, Minister, means that there won't be time to consult the judiciary—not over a period of three months. Several weekends and perhaps holidays will intervene, Minister, and we can't consult the judiciary in that time." They would have said finally—which would have been the absolute killer—that the Treasury would never wear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight one might wonder what the matter has to do with the Treasury and, rhetorically, one might consider that that is a very good question. However, we must face up to the fact that if clause 2 were implemented, there would be substantial implications for the Treasury. It would mean more remanding in custody, which would affect police and prison budgets. Therefore, there is force in the point that the measure would not get past the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what has been said in recent years about the need for non-custodial options and so on, two different messages have been conveyed. First, the custodial option is obviously used when there is no decent and realistic choice. That point will bring together hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and of the House. Secondly, however—and this is important—when the Treasury hears that argument, it thinks that by exploiting it and by paying it much more attention than is due to it, money can be saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that incarceration, whether just for hours prior to bail or for what passes these days as locking up someone for life, is an extremely expensive option. One of the reasons why the criminal justice system is in its present state of disarray—and I compliment my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary for tackling that problem—and why it is not simply a question of retaining the public's respect and confidence, but of getting them back, is that we have not faced up to the facts that incarceration is sometimes the only option and that it is wildly expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is noted in the House for having an extremely good memory. Perhaps he remembers that when I raised this matter quite recently in Prime Minister's questions, the First Lord of the Treasury said to the House that the Government were conscious of the problem of re-offending on bail and that the matter was being addressed urgently. I hope that my hon. Friend might agree with me, therefore, that the tacit support of the First Lord of the Treasury—in providing the necessary cash to do the job—is something that we should all welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In seizing, like any politician for an appropriate cliche, I do not know whether to go for Homer nodding or blessed the sinner that repenteth. Whichever one it is, it is obvious that custodial options will have to be produced, which will be expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, in the three months or so that lead from the First Reading of a Bill, those siren voices from the officials, as they recycle the Government status quo—as they believe it to be—might say that the Treasury will never stand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from my hon. Friend the Minister's comments today that Government legislation will be forthcoming. Everybody always has their own shopping
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
list, when it comes to spending other people's money. Since politicians are in the business of spending other people's money, we all come burdened with a shopping list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make the following point and then I shall say no more. I can think of no better way of spending the taxpayers' money than in a venture to try to convince people that Parliament actually does understand how they feel. It does understand the real fear that exists among many elderly people. When Members of Parliament leave their constituencies at the weekend and go to the marvellously secure accommodation at Westminster, they should understand the utter sense of fear, disillusion and disgust among the public. They should understand when the public believe—sometimes, not entirely fairly—that not just their Government, but their Parliament, have failed to come up with options that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 2, my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham has drafted something that anybody who has worked in the criminal justice system or who has done a constituency surgery would think was entirely proper. I have suggested—I do not expect to have it confirmed or denied—the kind of consideration that has stopped clause 2 going ahead today. It may be a sufficient reason for it not going ahead today; it will not be a sufficient reason for not seeing it in the Government's legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a slight irony that we are discussing a clause that we shall not do anything about. Such are the ways of the House that it gives us an opportunity for interesting and constructive discussion on occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some reservations about the comments made by the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) because it is important that we should persuade people that Parliament is serious about such issues. It is important that we should restore confidence. But we shall restore confidence and overcome the genuine fear of people throughout the country only if Parliament—in particular, Government—does something real to tackle those problems and reduce the dangers. Words will not be enough. As we are now referring to senior members of the Government, I do not think that the Prime Minister helped one little bit by suggesting that we should understand a little less about the problems of crime. We need to understand a great deal more and to act a great deal more to reduce and tackle the problems of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reservation about some of the debate is that it is a total waste of time and effort if the Government concentrate their effort on throwing time and money at one end of the criminal justice system only. Within the criminal justice system—despite the welcome moves that the Minister is taking in the direction of bail information assistance, to which he referred earlier—only the smallest steps are being taken to reduce and prevent crime. We genuinely need a partnership between the police, local authorities and local communities to tackle the problems of crime and of offending, which are illustrated by the need for this Bil. Those problems must be tackled. It is odd that the bail system offers the alternatives of spending as much as £2,000 to incarcerate a person while he or she is awaiting trial, and of doing nothing. The gap is far too great. Bail is a much cheaper option than incarceration. The Bill will occupy the right place in the criminal justice system only when the balance is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When things go wrong, we need to be able to refuse bail. However, we also need to be able to prevent crime in the community, to divert people—especially the young—away from criminal activity and to act more quickly in getting decisions in the criminal justice system. We must make bail effective and reduce the need for incarceration. We should not be content to see rates of incarceration grow as quickly as the crime rates. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the pleas for secure accommodation. For many years, people have campaigned for secure accommodation for young offenders to be made available. That would end the scandal of young people between the ages of 15 and 16 being held in adult prisons because there is nowhere else to hold them. That cannot be right. Two years ago, the then Minister of State, Home Office—who is now, to put it neutrally, dealing with education—said that secure accommodation would be provided to meet that requirement. Not a single additional place has been provided so far. It has been suggested that the matter has been left for other Departments to deal with, such as the Department of Health and the Welsh Office. The problem has been shrugged off down the line as an increased expense for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are two aspects to the question of adequate secure accommodation? The first concerns the provision of secure places to accommodate those young people who would have been sent to prison before the Criminal Justice Act 1991. That amounts to about 60 places. Such provision is the responsibility of the Department of Health as part of its responsibility for children. However, the hon. Gentleman was also concerned about the second aspect, which relates to adequate secure accommodation to deal with the generality of young offenders who at present are sent to community homes and who abscond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem goes wider than the places necessary to deal with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act Money must be spent on the buildings and on the trained staff needed to run them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and the hon. Gentleman's intervention is most helpful. The impression was given when the Criminal Justice Bill was going through the House that both aspects would be dealt with. In fact, the announcement to which I have referred dealt only with the first aspect. The action that followed the announcement failed to deal even with that limited aspect. I share some of the frustration about the second aspect of the problem which the hon. Gentleman described. My own local authority has put forward proposals on secure accommodation for some two years, only to meet with obstruction by the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have wandered into these paths had not Conservative Members raised the questions that invited me to do so, Mr. Hill, because these matters are not strictly relevant to the provisions of the Bill. However, as they were raised during the clause stand part debate, it is right to ensure that the views are balanced. The Treasury might have been happy with the new clauses because they tackle the second element. It is important that, when necessary,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
a person is incarcerated for the protection of the public. However, it is also important that everything is done to minimise that need. I hope that I have balanced the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth properly asked about secure accommodation. The occupancy level last year was 90 per cent. Places are available if local authorities exercise their powers to use them. Sadly, some local authorities do not. The hon. Gentleman is critical of the programme to build secure accommodation to fulfil the requirements of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, but I assure him that plans are in place, money is available and the accommodation will be built on time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Dudley Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, regret the fact that my hon. Friend wishes to withdraw the clause. However, I understand why he is doing so. I echo almost everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge said. Unless Parliament does the right thing, it will not retain the confidence of the people. That would be a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "bail" is surely a misnomer nowadays. A millionaire swindler who is charged with fraud and bailed for a large amount of money and decamps must forfeit the money. Bail is taken away from people of some substance if they do not fulfil their bail provisions. However, we are considering the young, embryo criminals who create mayhem in society. Many are young men of straw. They have no means of repayment if they abscond or commit other offences while on bail. Even when they are caught again and prosecuted, the fact that they have broken their bail provisions is not taken into account in the overall penalty. The word "bail" and whether its provisions can be regularised should be examined. There should be a system whereby people who are charged can be let out before the case comes to court if they are not a menace to society. Those who are a menace should be kept in secure accommodation. We are in strange territory when we consider the former concept of bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Teignbridge, and without saying too much about any conversation that I may have held with my hon. Friend the Minister, I can confirm that the approach of my hon.

However, that is a minor criticism—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait until he really gets going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Treasury tends to examine only direct costs; it tends not to take into account the other side of the equation. If the Bill becomes law, it may be that more people are remanded in custody, although I suspect not that many more, and there will be associated costs. However, we are dealing with repeat offenders whose crimes have to be detected, and who time and time again have to be arrested and prosecuted. That costs a great deal of money. While such people are at liberty committing further crimes, their activities cost our constituents and their insurance companies a huge
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
amount of money. It could fairly be said to the Treasury that gaol may be cheaper than bail for such offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington, I agree that courts should have the power to have regard to an offence being committed while a defendant has been on bail. They should also have the power to impose a greater sentence than they would otherwise pass by virtue of an offence being committed on bail. I have no doubt that the House will review the Criminal Justice Act 1991 before long. I hope that we will take that opportunity to deal with the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express regret about subsection (3), which confines the Bill's provisions to England and Wales. I regret that it was not possible to extend the legislation's provisions to Northern Ireland. We have heard that there are equivalent provisions in place for Scotland. I am confident that the Bill will reach the statute book and I am delighted to see it proceed. I congratulate the hon. Member for Shoreham on introducing it. My confidence allows me to say that the Bill will reach the statute book. However, the evils which it addresses will not have a remedy in one of the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. The problem that the Bill will tackle exists in Northern Ireland to the same extent that it exists elsewhere. It is true that in Diplock cases there are restrictions on the right to bail, and properly so. However, in other cases, we suffer from the same problem as the rest of the country, and in some respects it is worse. When professional criminals come before the courts, there is a tendency for people to say, "Oh, these are ordinary, decent criminals. They are not nasty terrorists." There is a greater readiness to grant bail. That is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is serious in my constituency. On a couple of public housing estates, there are grave problems with repeat offenders, who carry out mainly burglaries. They have destroyed—by that I mean demolished—90 per cent. of one estate. They have now started on another. Hundreds of houses have been pulled down as a result of the activities of such gentlemen. They will supply kitchen or bathroom suites. If none are to hand, they will lob a few petrol bombs into a house to clear out the people, strip out the goods and sell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such people are brought regularly before the courts and regularly given bail. It would be delightful if the Bill's provisions were extended to Northern Ireland. The thought of tabling an amendment to that effect crossed my mind, but I realised that that would delay proceedings. It would be delightful if the Minister would convey to his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office the message that we want equivalent legislation because there will be an anomaly. Such an anomaly should be tackled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New clause 3 has not been selected for debate. As the Bill allows an appeal that will deprive people of their liberty in a way that has not happened in the past, immediate representation should be assured. As the new clause would ensure that there was no delay regarding a decision on the availability of legal aid and representation—which would possibly also delay the
