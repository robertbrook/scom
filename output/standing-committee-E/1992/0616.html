	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Community Care (Residential Accommodation) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I am not casting aspersions on the advertised Chairman when I say what a pleasure it is to be sitting under your chairmanship, with the firmness and fairness for which you are renowned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point of order concerns the ability of the Committee to deal with the Bill, which covers England and Wales. The membership of the Committee includes no Welsh Office Minister, nor any Welsh Conservative Member. It is important that we should have answers to questions raised, although I appreciate that it is for the Committee of Selection to select members. It is difficult to see how, without a Welsh Office Minister, answers can be given to questions about the Government's intentions and about the way in which the Bill will operate in Wales, where the Welsh Office has jurisdiction over community care, residential care, and other aspects relevant to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dame Janet, would it not be appropriate to adjourn the Committee and ask the Committee of Selection to add a Welsh Office Minister so that proper replies can be given to the questions raised during the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, this is a matter not for the Chair but for the Committee of Selection. If the hon. Member wishes to pursue the matter with that Committee, that is his prerogative. My overwhelming duty is to see that this Committee proceeds, and that is what we shall now do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Dame Janet. I accept your advice, but could we seek, through you, an assurance from the Minister that we shall obtain from him answers to questions concerning Wales and that we shall not find, as we have in the past, that Ministers with jurisdiction in England are unable to give the Committee the information that it needs? I appreciate that selection of members is not a matter for you, Dame Janet, but I am sure that the good order and the ability of the Committee to deal with the issues is of concern to all sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's second point is again one with which I cannot deal personally. If the Minister wishes to mention it in passing, that is entirely up to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tim Yeo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am permitted, Dame Janet, may I also welcome you to the Chair? I know of your interest in these matters and I believe that you were chairman of the Committee that dealt with the Bill out of which the need for this measure arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Community Care (Residential Accommodation) (Bill) [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too welcome you, Dame Janet, to the Chair of the Committee. I hope that you enjoy our deliberations. I know that you take a keen interest in this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion is fairly normal, as one would expect, but it is not a normal Bill. If this measure were needed tomorrow, the Bill would go through on the nod. There is no opposition to the Bill from the Labour party, or, as far as I am aware, from the Liberal Democrats. We have made it our business—as shown by our comments on Second Reading and by the amendments that we have tabled—to use the Bill to explore the progress made in community care plans and the changes that are due to take place in April 1993. This is probably the only opportunity that Members will have to debate the issue. It took more than a year to have a debate in the House on community care. This is not a contentious issue so I hope that we can take a fairly relaxed view. We want to make progress, however; we are not going to mess about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a point, not so much to the Minister but to his colleagues sitting behind him. Just for once, I would like to serve on a Standing Committee and participate in a proper debate. I would genuinely like to know Conservative Members' views on community care policies in their areas, and not just have a ding-dong between Labour Members and the Minister about what is happening in our own backyards or areas with which we are familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill relates to a good cross-section of areas in England, and there is a good smattering of new hon. Members on the Committee. Therefore, I hope that Conservative Members, who I suspect have been instructed to keep their mouths shut and their backsides on their seats, will not take the advice that they have been given. We welcome the opportunity for some dialogue on what progress is or is not being made with community care plans, which affect millions of our fellow citizens. That is why the amendments have been framed in the way that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the legislation was not scrutinised in the other place. In fact, the Bill was considered in the other place twice—once before the election and once since. That can hardly be described as scrunity of legislation or as their Lordships often loftily put it, more non-partisan, more detailed consideration of legislation than takes place in the House of Commons. They have not done their job, so it is left to the House of Commons to do what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will take that in the spirit in which it is intended. We have plenty of time. The provisions of the Bill are required to be in force before 1 April 1993—not that we shall sit until 1 April 1993. However, bearing in mind recent reports that the House may adjourn for the summer recess on 10 July, rather than on 17 July, and if we are about to embark on a 16-week recess it would be good if new Conservative Members were able to say that, for a few weeks they had done a job of work in Committee and had actually pulled their weight in the House of Commons. I hope that we will make reasonable progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not working to any particular timetable, although I suspect that the Minister has been told to finalise the Bill in one morning—clearly, that cannot be done—but I should have thought that a couple of weeks, give or take a sitting or two, would allow plenty of time for our deliberations. That is not an offer or a commitment, but it shows the spirit in which Opposition Members enter into the discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Chair, Dame Janet, and congratulate you on your elevation to the post of Deputy Speaker? I have had the privilege of serving on previous Committees that you have chaired and you have always been scrupulously fair and objective, which is appreciated. Of course, it is especially appropriate that you are here today because you chaired the Standing Committee that considered the National Health Service and Community Care Bill. Perhaps members of that Committee share some responsibility for allowing the lacuna to go through unnoticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) said, we have an opportunity to discuss in detail crucial questions about community care. The opportunity comes at an appropriate time in the run-up to the changes that we hope will go through on 1 April 1993. I have long thought that community care has been grossly neglected by Parliament. It is of key importance to vast numbers of our constituents, yet the Government never allow us the opportunity to discuss it. The only opportunities to discuss the issue in the House of Commons arise when Labour Members table motions, usually in their own time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is especially worrying that the Government clearly intended to nod the legislation through with the minimum of debate. That is unacceptable. The issue was discussed in another place in a couple of hours and was given scant consideration. It did not go before a Committee, but all stages of the Bill were dealt with in one go. We have a duty to ensure that the Bill is properly scrutinised and that the wider issues that arise from the legislation and from the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 are fully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Minister for his opening speech on Second Reading because it allowed hon. Members free range on the wider issues that relate to the Bill. That debate evidenced the extent of interest in the matter. Labour Members were queuing up to speak, that was not the case with Conservative Members—they sometimes seemed to run short of speakers, but that is not unusual when we discuss community care. I pay tribute to Conservative Members who spoke, especially the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), whose knowledge I respect. The Committee proceedings allow us to consider a range of community care issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the sittings motion, we should examine whether it is appropriate to meet twice a week. We should consider the pace at which we will consider the Bill. As I made clear on Second Reading, I have no desire to obstruct the Bill's progress. The Bill has come from another place and its stages in this House can be examined in a leisurely fashion and in some detail so that we do a thorough and proper job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that knowledge of the Bill's implications is minimal. If there were a straw poll of Members in the Corridor, 99 per cent would not have a clue about what the Bill deals with. We must explain to our colleagues the Bill's purpose and impact and the related, wider issues. I am worried about the extent of knowledge about the Bill among members of the Committee. There are several honourable exceptions: I am proud to be on the Labour team, which has people with considerable expertise and interest, particularly among new hon. Friends who have directly relevant backgrounds and can offer recent experience and information on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) was chairman of the Leeds social services committee. I had the honour to work for the social services department in Leeds for many years, so I know my hon. Friend's patch and I am aware of the valuable work that he has done. My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) has a relevant academic background and will make important contributions. I memtion my two hon. Friends because they are the only Labour team Members of the Committee who did not speak on Second Reading. The commitment and interest of other Labour Members is apparent from their contributions on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point because hon. Members need more time to consider the detail of the Bill, take advice on its implications and visit affected establishments, such as the Abbeyfield society. Some hon. Members may be fortunate in having an Abbeyfield society in their constituencies, as I have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean no disrespect to Conservative Members, but only two Conservative members of the Committee spoke on Second Reading. Their contributions were good—I pay particular tribute to the hon. Member for Chislehurst. He criticised me, but made some points of substance and there was some common ground on the issues that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member continues, we do not want a rerun of the Second Reading debate: we need to know why he supports or does not support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to adopt a more leisurely pace than that of the two sittings per week set out by the Minister. That would enable hon. Members, especially new hon. Members, to understand and take account of representations that they receive about the Bill. I have had the opportunity of visiting an Abbeyfield society, but there are other organisations whose work will be affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only two Conservative members of the Committee spoke on Second Reading. With respect, I suspect that the other seven have only limited knowledge of the Bill. It would be a positive experience and a help to them if they were able to take time to examine the Bill's impact on their own constituencies and elsewhere. It would be a positive help to the Government if we slowed down the process and met just once a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to take advice on issues from a range of organisations with an interest in the Bill. I have met the Abbeyfield society at local level, but not at national level. I would have welcomed the chance to have talked to its national officers about our amendments and what the society would find acceptable. I have met the British Association of Social Workers, but it was a very hurried meeting and I would welcome the opportunity of a further meeting. My hon. Friends would welcome the opportunity to take part in such a meeting so that they could have a similar briefing from people who have knowledge of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not had the chance to meet the Association of Directors of Social Services—its role is directly affected by the Bill—the Social Care Association or the National Association of Inspection and Registration Officers. Nor have I met the various private sector organisations with an interest in the Bill, such as the British Federation of Care
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Home Proprietors and the National Care Homes Association, which, to its great credit, has sent briefing notes to the Committee. I would have liked to have met the National Institute for Social Work, which has concern about standards in homes that will be affected and placements that will be arranged, and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which has a direct involvement with individual organisations whose work is affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been helpful if the parliamentary panel on personal social services had had the opportunity to consider the Bill in detail. The hon. Member for Mid Kent (Mr. Rowe) is the chairman of the group, which has not yet met since the general election. I am concerned that that group, which includes representation from a number of bodies with expertise and interest in the relevant issues, has not had the opportunity to study the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also have been helpful if the Government and members of the Committee could have studied relevant reports. I refer specifically to the fourth report of the Select Committee on Social Security on care homes. That report contains information and recommendations relevant to the Bill. Paragraph 90, in particular, refers to the need to consider alternatives to residential and institutional care, an issue which should directly concern us in considering how we should deal with the Bill. Paragraphs 70 to 77 and 95 and 96, about hospital procedures and discharge procedures in relation to community care, have a bearing on the consideration and contents of the Bill. I know that I am not alone in feeling that the Government's response to the Select Committee report was grossly inadequate and, to some extent, contemptous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In suggesting that we slow down our proceedings, I also urge hon. Members to look at the Counsel and Care reports on privacy and on restraint, and the recent Royal College of Nursing report on elderly people and nursing care in residential and nursing homes, which was published in April. I recommend also the Utting report, the National Institute for Social Work report on the general social services council, published in May, and the recent report of the Howe inquiry into the staffing of residential homes. All those important and recent reports are directly relevant to consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dissatisfied with the way in which we have had to table amendments. In the week when Second Reading was suddenly arranged, and when the Government's business suddenly collapsed because of the Danish vote and the two-day Maastricht Bill debate was withdrawn, it was most unsatisfactory that Back-Benchers had less than 24 hours' notice and had to rush round and table amendments to ensure that we had a decent period in which to consider the Bill in detail. I pay tribute to the Committee Clerk, who has gone out of his way to be helpful and adivse us. He has been under tremendous pressure in bringing together the various amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the hon. Gentleman that he is straying far from the brief, which is to consider the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your advice Dame Janet. One of your responsibilities as Deputy Speaker is to protect the interests and rights of Back Benchers. I am attempting to make the point that we have not had an adequate opportunity to take advice and to formulate appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
amendments. The amendments have been rushed and some may be inappropriate. With the greatest respect to the Clerk, who has given us much help, it is unsatisfactory to get fewer than 24 hours' notice of a possible Committee stage to be taken on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a much slower programme than that which is proposed. I am sorry to have taken so long, but I hope that my points have been relevant to the sittings motion. What is the Government's hurry? They are embarrassed by the complete lack of parliamentary business. Why do we need to rush the Bill through? I hope that there will be a spirit of consensus on some of the amendments, so why can we not have a detailed discussion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr said, Conservative Members should feel free to speak on issues that are not party political. The issues cross party lines, as does concern about people who will be affected by the legislation. My hon. Friend mentioned that we may rise for the summer recess on 10 July. There is no hurry over the Bill. It has gone through the other place. There is plenty of time for it to pass through the remaining stages and receive Royal Assent before 1 April next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the proposals for two sittings a week. It should be slowed down to one sitting a week so that we would have time for the wider discussions that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcomed the Second Reading debate which gave us the opportunity to debate community care in a wider context. I hope that we will be afforded the same opportunity in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a new Member, it seems to me that the Committee was called very quickly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) pointed out. It came on us all rather quickly, and the time for drafting amendments seemed to be short. I would welcome more time for debate and to consider further amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also have welcomed more time to have consulted other people and organisations about some of the issues. I would have liked to have talked to some voluntary organisations, particularly Help the Aged, Age Concern and the Council for Voluntary Service. I would also have welcomed the opportunity to talk to directors of social services and general practitioners. Sometimes, we overlook the role of GPs in implementing community care legislation. Other organisations that I would have liked to have had discussions with are the all-party organisations that have a specific interest in community care, as I have discovered since coming to the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee meets once a week, that will give us time to consult other organisations on their views so that we can reflect them properly in the Committee. I support one sitting a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, congratulate you on your appointment, Dame Janet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has a choice about whether to be rammed through without consideration, or to use the opportunity provided by the Bill to consider the issues more deeply. The implications of the changes in the patterns of community care in the months and years to come may mean that care will be provided by a wider range of bodies and institutions than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling that this is an Abbeyfield society Bill which also deals with a number of smaller voluntary organisations providing small units of care, but that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
main stream of community care is covered by other legislation. I anticipate that there will be changes in the range of organisations and institutions providing community care in the future and that many more elderly people will live in accommodation covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area of north Yorkshire, the social services committee has commissioned a firm of management consultants to investigate the merits and demerits of the council divesting itself of half its part III homes and placing them under new management to fulfil a new role. The most likely option under consideration is that the new management will be a voluntary, non-profitmaking organisation, and that the role and nature of the services provided in what are still part III homes will more closely resemble the Abbeyfield model, in which not social care but some back-up services, including communal meals, are provided. As a result, the Bill may affect many more elderly people than is projected at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that we should string out the Committee's proceedings. However, we would do better to meet less frequently over a longer period. I say that partly because we need to look at some of the wider implications of the Bill and partly because, as a new Member of Parliament, I am feeling my way and learning how the Committee process operates. I do not want to discover in a week that the Bill has been reported but that, because I did not understand the procedure, I had missed making a helpful contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members will be aware that York has a deep-rooted and ingrained voluntary sector. I have organised consultation exercises on Labour party community care policy documents that have involved mailing lists of more than 100 bodies. In considering the implications of the Bill, I want to be able to consult with and pick the brains of those bodies. I have visited one of the two Abbeyfield homes in York and I do not want to be unable to propose constructive changes to the Bill that would enhance the quality of care and life of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield mentioned my academic background. I have done some work on care for the elderly, but there are many people in my constituency—in the social policy research unit, the centre for health economics, the centre for housing studies and the university's department of social policy and social work—who know a great deal more about the issues. I should prefer to attend the Committee's proceedings well informed, rather than ill-informed. Our discussions should be serious and informed rather than rushed and hasty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Yorkshire county council recently published a policy to try to guard against the abuse of elderly people. It is a controversial policy because it makes the point that its carers, both paid—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given the hon. Gentleman considerable latitude as he is new.

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. I have stated the range of organisations from which I would want to take advice during the Committee's deliberations on the Bill. I hope that we can agree to meet once a week so that we sit over a longer period of time and therefore give new
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
members on both sides of the Committee the opportunity to take advice and to contribute to the debate in as informed a manner as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Tessa Jowell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. As a new Member of Parliament, I seek your guidance on whether it is possible for the Committee to invite evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I join my hon. Friends in supporting the case for an extended period of sittings. As my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) said, this is more than just a technical measure. It is an opportunity for us to consider the problems involved in implementing this complex and demanding Bill, which are being revealed in the work of local health authorities and voluntary organisations. If we are to support the work of people in the field and to allay the anxieties and apprehensions of carers and disabled people about the impact of the measure, we must ensure that our debate is full and well informed, not constrained by irrelevant considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friends in asking for an extended period for our debates. I was interested to hear that there had not been a discussion on community care in the Chamber for a year. Councils have had extended debates on the consequences of community care legislation and I should have welcomed the opportunity to discuss their views with council departments, health authorities, voluntary organisations and private organisations in Stockport. I would have liked to have fed those views, based on long experience, into the debate. For example, I would have liked to have talked to the director of housing because Stockport provides supported tenancies—group homes for the elderly. I would have liked to have known how the Bill and the financing arrangements would affect those homes, but unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to do so. Housing is important in the provision of community care. Unless council housing departments have the means to make the necessary adaptations to their buildings and to provide warden-controlled tenancies, it will be difficult to give elderly people the quality of life that they need in the community, particularly as the rising crime rate causes a great deal of anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My council has millions in the bank, but it cannot spend that money as it would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is falling into the same trap as other members of the Committee. She must address herself to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Dame Janet. I was trying to illustrate the problems that should be examined in making a proper contribution to the debate. Like other new Members, this is our first opportunity to take part in a Standing Committee and to have a say in community care issues. I am sorry if I have strayed from the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to talk to voluntary associations. They provide many workers who form the keystone of community care. I also wished to discuss transport facilities. Enormous problems have arisen in the ambulance service and voluntary agencies have to provide transport, but unfortunately I have not been able to do that. There are also problems in funding elderly people in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the private sector. The Bill enables local authorities to fund unregistered homes and other associations. The private sector has enormous problems with funding because of the level of the DSS grant. I should have liked to talk to homes in the private sector about their problems and future funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said earlier, the Bill is uncontentious. I hope that Conservative members of the Committee will contribute to the debate. As a councillor I am pleased to be involved in an ongoing debate. If Conservative Members do not wish to contribute, I hope that they will make a passing reference on our comments. We should like more time to outline difficulties that could arise if we do not make modifications to improve this and other aspects of the Bill. This may be our last opportunity to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular interest in welcoming the concept of community care because I was a social worker for 20 years before I became a Member of Parliament. At one time I worked with the elderly. I remember admitting an elderly man to part III accommodation in 1971—that was not during a Labour Administration—and being appalled that there was no choice because his wife had died and he had no one to look after him. I welcome the notion of community care and choice for elderly people because I have seen them being deprived of their dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to consult health authorities because throughout the country problems arise in their communications with local social services departments about budgets. Some hospitals have high on the agenda difficulties over trust status. As Members of Parliament we should have an overview of what is happening and consider how the system could be made to work better. We have a commitment to community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady again, but she is now discoursing on community care in general and that is not the purpose of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I apologise, Dame Janet. I was referring to the fact that our reason for wanting a proper, extended debate on this subject was not that we wish to be contentious. I was simply restating the values of community care and choice and dignity for the elderly. We welcome and respect those values because elderly people are not children and should not have decisions made about them irrespective of their views. There is nothing different in being 80 years old.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Lady could have been listening to me. I am sorry, but she must now resume her seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to tread that fine line between observing and not observing the rules. I am sure that you will pull me up rapidly, Dame Janet, if I fail to observe them properly. In the debate on the frequency with which we meet, the issues at stake are, first, whether we need the business to be completed with the utmost speed or whether there is time for a more relaxed timetable, and, secondly, whether there is an advantage to the Committee and to the eventual shape of the legislation in taking longer over it and considering more evidence, I think that, overwhelmingly, the answer to the first point is no, there is no need for undue haste. Obviously, we have to conclude the proceedings by 1 April
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
1993, but not by 10 or 17 July 1992 or whatever day the House rises. On the second point the answer is clearly yes: we ought to explore these matters fully. It is fortunate that the lacuna occurred because it has given us the opportunity to return to a subject of considerable concern elsewhere even if it does not take up a great deal of time in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) said, until less than a month ago I was the chair of social services in a large city. I had responsibility for not only the elderly but the adults whose care would be covered by the Bill. I had the unenviable reputation of having closed more local authority homes for elderly people than probably anyone else in sight—probably more than anyone else in the House. That was necessary: it was not possible to bring some of those homes up to the required standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities, despite their preparations, are apprehensive about 1 April 1993, primarily because the financial arrangements are still uncertain. Also, many points need clarification, and this is clearly one of them. We accept that we need to complete the passage of the Bill, otherwise existing arrangements that local authorities find satisfactory would have to end. Therefore it is right to make good the gap in the previous legislation. We want to take longer to consider the Bill because we want to be absolutely certain that once it is passed we will not discover more omissions that should have been dealt with. In the time available to us we should explore two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adult abuse has come on to the agenda as a result of usually tragic cases that show the vulnerability of the elderly people and of those who suffer from learning difficulties. Such people may be abused and exploited. We must ensure that any arrangements that we make do not create new loopholes for exploitation while closing others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when we consider unregistered accommodation, we must be careful about the conditions under which it exists, because it represents a possible loophole. There are issues that need to be explored with considerable care. The argument about time applies to the need for hon. Members who have no experience of such matters to take the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of what is essential in running accommodation for the elderly or those with learning difficulties. Although one accepts that hon. Members can gain only limited experience, it would nevertheless be beneficial. Considerable dangers exist in tackling unregistered accommodation. It is important to block existing loopholes, but, in doing so, let us not allow others to appear when we would prefer to explore and deal with them through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Liz Lynne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would make a plea for once a week. We should have a wider debate on the subject. The Bill is very specific. Perhaps we could reach a compromise by discussing the matter once a week but not spending a long time on it. If we had more time, I should like to discuss, for example, community health services going into residential accommodation. We could also discuss the shortfall in funding and whether the Government would maintain current income support levels or give more money to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. However much time we have, I remind members of the Committee that it is not possible to go outside the terms of the long title of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Lynne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Dame Janet. As I said, a compromise might be reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Stockport (Ms. Coffey), for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) and for Dulwich (Ms. Jowell) on their disciplined contributions to the debate. I also welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms. Lynne). The sittings debate will be short by any standards. I hope that the Minister has heard the reservations expressed by many hon. Members and that he will reassure us in a way that allows us to support the sittings motion. He can do that if he takes proper account of the points raised. In the issues covered by this short Bill, there is a fine line between care in the community and what I might describe as the "heavy end" of sheltered accommodation. This simple Bill could have enormous consequences. As my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr said, the Opposition fully support correcting the lacuna in the National Health Service and Care in the Community Bill. However, we need to be sure about the knock-on effect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the effect of the measure? At this point, I would seek guidance from a Welsh Office Minister about his assessment of the impact of the Bill in Wales. Inevitably, we are denied a response to that. Will the result of the measure be to expand this sort of provision well beyond the organisation, particularly the Abbeyfield society, which currently makes it available? If so, there are reasons to hasten slowly in our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of legislation are not always as intended. To illistrate the point with an example relevant to the Bill, food regulations are intended to protect the public. However, in residential homes, elderly volunteers and children from local schools are often involved in the provision of meals. Those children gain experience and provide a valuable feeling of home for elderly people. The residents themselves, in a therapeutic context and because they are in their own home, may also be involved. Food hygiene legislation that seeks to protect the public can set at risk those aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should ensure that there is no unintentional knock-on effect from the Bill. He should assure us that has been carefully considered by the Government and that he does not intend to rush the measure. The ordering of our debates must take such matters into account. Unless the Minister can reassure us on this point, we must take time to consider the Bill's impact on the budgets of social services departments. My inquiries suggest that directors of social services cannot assess the Bill's impact. Accommodation that could be described as an extreme end of sheltered accommodation should not be dealt with in a way that would lead to local authorities paying out money that is outwith the intentions of the original legislation. Local authorities welcome anything that gives them greater flexibility in meeting the requirements that have been placed upon them and therefore welcome the flexibility offered by the Bill. However, authorities must be careful; not to increase their financial reaponsibilities and expectations out of the same pot of money. That would happen if social services departments were expected to meet the care costs of the Abbeyfield society or other organisations affected by the Bill in respect of people who would not otherwise be in residential or nursing home care. The Minister could reassure us on the point if, in his
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
summing up, he told us that there was no danger of that happening and that the Government will keep a clear distinction between funding for the heavy end of sheltered accommodation and the use of such accommodation—very properly—for people who would otherwise be going into other forms of residential accommodation. We need to be sure that we do not leave any new gaps in filling the gap that the Bill seeks to fill. Some amendments raise issues about the operation and context of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are starting to debate the functions of the Bill. At this stage, we are dealing only with the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. My point is that by giving us reassurance on some of those points, the Minister will enable the Opposition enthusiastically to support the sittings motion. We have not so much objections to as reservations about the Bill. We want the Minister to make clear the context in which the Bill will apply. I hope that he will take the opportunity to do so. We are limited in debating the whole subject of care in the community because the Bill covers one narrow point. However, the Bill deals with the overlap between non-residential, residential and sheltered accommodation. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield sat on the Committee that considered the National Health Service and Community Care Bill, which you chaired, Dame Janet. We were all worried about the ways in which problems could arise and care in the community could become neglect in the community unless we ensured that we have the right context for all decisions. We raise points now in the hope that the Minister can reassure us. Hon. Members have raised important issues in this short debate. We wish to debate a variety of limited, but important, aspects when we consider the amendments. I hope that the Minister will reassure us so that we can move on to their constructive consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the interest taken in the Bill by Opposition Members, especially the clear commitment given by the hon. Member for Perry Barr of his party's support for the Bill and his commitment to make progress in Committee. It would not be appropriate, and possibly not in order, for me to repeat the wide-ranging speech that I made on Second Reading, but if the hon. Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) reads the record he will see that it dealt fully with the points that he makes. I deliberately ranged widely in that speech knowing that it was possible more easily to stay within the bounds of order on Second Reading than it will be in Committee. I know that you, Dame Janet, will keep a close eye on the scope of our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am as keen as any Opposition Member for matters to be fully aired. I welcome contributions from my hon. Friends whose well-known expertise in these matters yields nothing to that of Opposition Members. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Berkshire East (Mr. MacKay) shares my view. As the policy is bipartisan there is no reason for the Government to wish to stifle debate. I began to detect a faint sign of disarray on the Opposition Benches. The clear commitment to progress given by the hon. Member for Perry Barr did not seem to underly all the other contributions from his hon. Friends. Listening to the debate, people might have thought that the Bill had been sprung on the House. I remind the Committee that an identical measure was introduced in the previous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Parliament. It proceeded through the other place and was lost only at the last minute in the House just before the general election. The Government's intention to reintroduce a similar measure was well known. If Opposition Members had taken the amount of interest in these matters that they say they do, they should have known that the measure would come before the House in this form. There has been ample opportunity for discussion, visits and all the other reasons for delay that the Opposition have prayed in aid to take place during the past two and a half months. Only recently, my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) visited an Abbeyfield home in his constituency, no doubt with his Committee duties in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister share this bipartisan approach and tell the Committee when exactly the Bill would have come before the House if it were not for the Danish referendum result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that it would have come before the House before the summer recess, even if the recess is, happily, advanced. He appears to have more information on that than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that if Opposition Members are as cooperative on other measures as they are on this one, my hon. Friend the Member for Berkshire East will have no difficulty persuading his colleagues from the Whips Office to start the summer recess on 3 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been more than ample time for hon. Members to explore the issues in the Bill. I must say how charmed I was by the contribution from the hon. Member for Rochdale. After the Government sittings motion proposed two meetings a week, and the Opposition suggested one sitting a week, in the honoured tradition of her party, the hon. Lady suggested that there should be something in between.

	<p>It may be for the interest of the Committee if I explain that, although we move only one amendment at a time, when amendments are grouped debate is possible and perfectly in order on all or any of them. If we come to a vote on an amendment which is not the lead amendment, we

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
have to wait until it is reached and it is then moved formally. I hope that that short explanation will clarify matters which are sometimes bewildering to new Members.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. This is to seek further clarification. Some of the groups of amendments cover a wide, although related, range of topics. Is it the practice in Committee that members who wish to contribute on one or two different items do so in one hotch-potch contribution, or will we have opportunities to come back as the debate goes on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Provided that the Member can catch the eye of the Chairman, it is perfectly in order to come back more than once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been made clear in the debate on the sittings motion that the Bill deals with known organisations and situations which, at this stage, may not have been anticipated. The Bill will enable local authorities to make placements with organisations that do not exist at the moment. In discussion of the Bill, we will be anticipating situations that may arise which the Bill should cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make it clear at the outset that the amendments should not be interpreted as a reflection on any known organisation that will be affected by the Bill. I am sure that the Abbeyfield society, for one, understands that, but it needs to be stated and recorded. The amendments anticipate problems. They are also based to some extent on existing problems in organisations—other than the one that I have mentioned—such as private and voluntary homes and, to some extent, in the public sector. The amendments are wide-ranging and relevant to those groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 would introduce a specific agreement based on advice given in the social services inspectorate's document "Homes Are For Living In". The fourth principle in that document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each resident should have a written contract agreeing terms and conditions of residence and services to be provided."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would provide for that agreement to include a number of points. The notice period would be introduced because the position of paying residents in establishments such as those dealt with by the Bill is not clear in law. We know that they possess certain common law rights of occupation, but, for fairly obvious reasons, the people in such accommodation are often unable to exercise those rights. The legal position of such residents is significantly different in practice from that of people in local authority or private rented housing. A placement under the Bill may reduce or remove rights to residential security previously enjoyed by such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have encountered various instances in which people have been evicted, in effect, from care establishments. More frequently, they are moved down market to cheaper, less desirable accommodation or establishments. We hope that the agreement will overcome some of the current problems. I do not suggest that eviction is a major, everyday problem in every constituency. However, an elderly lady in my constituency was placed in a private care home for a short time while her family went abroad on holiday. Shortly after her arrival, the home decided that it was unable to cope with her condition. Instead of looking for alternative accommodation for my constituent, the home's management simply put her in a taxi and sent her to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
local police station. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that such action is unacceptable. An agreement such as we have described would overcome that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time ago, Sheffield's social services department publicised a report about a woman who had been dumped at the Royal Hallamshire hospital, after a private care home had found her to be too difficult to handle. Whatever one's views on private or public care, such unacceptable incidents should not occur. A clear agreement with the proper backing would overcome some of the problems that have been encountered. Indeed, the local authority in Sheffield was so worried about the evidence of such incidents that it threatened certain homes with deregistration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require a specific notice period, during which the residents or their representatives could consider the situation. Ideally, the agreement would be entered into with the local inspectorate. That would mean that the local authority would be aware of the circumstances of a person to whom notice is given. Not everyone has a representative—a carer or a family member—who can ensure that assistance is available when such difficulties arise. I accept that, because of the Bill's limitations, such a procedure cannot be included, but that would be the ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement would also ensure that financial arrangements are clear and that people entering an establishment would know what they are expected to pay and what they receive in return. Any additional charges over and above the basic charge would be made clear at the outset. The agreement would also make clear the nature of the accommodation being provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, the agreement would include a procedure by which residents are consulted before any changes are introduced in the services or accommodation that are provided. The document "Homes Are For Living In" describes the involvement of residents in all the decisions that affect their lives. In practice, however, that is often not true of homes in either the public or the private sector. The agreement should contain clear procedures describing how the process would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we feel strongly that, wherever possible, the agreement should allow residents to handle their financial affairs. That reflects statements made in various Government documents. People often become institutionalised as a result of the removal from them of the responsibility for handling their pensions and financial arrangements on admission into an establishment. They lose that little bit of independence by handing in then-pension book when a pension is often their only income. That is impractical. I accept that in some cases individuals are not mentally or physically capable of handling then-own financial affairs, but that is too often used as an excuse when people are able to handle their own affairs and would welcome the opportunity to do so. To see their income and to know where it is going keeps them aware of what is happening. This proposal reflects what the Government are saying, if not doing. It is common sense and entirely reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement should also include a clear complaints procedure. The social services inspectorate also suggests the need for such a procedure to include recourse to persons in authority outwith the home—for example, social services directors or councillors. The agreement covers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
matters on which I expect the Government's support because my points have been extracted, almost in their entirety, from Government documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 is about privacy—a sensitive issue, with which we should all be closely concerned. Over a period of years, a number of relevant reports have been considered, endorsed and, in some instances, written by the Government, yet in many care homes in both the public and private sectors there are still many glaring examples of the fact that individual privacy is not considered sensitively in the way in which people are handled and offered care. I shall mention a few reports that are of direct relevance in which privacy has been highlighted. I imagine that the Minister is familiar with all to them. Following the Registered Homes Act 1984, the Home Life document, published in 1984—the code of practice for registered homes—stresses strongly personal autonomy and privacy. The Wagner report, "A Postive Choice", which was published in 1988 and resulted in the caring in homes initiative and the Wagner development group, similarly laid great emphasis on privacy. In addition, "Certain Standards: inspection of the implementation of the 1984 Registered Homes Act", published by the Government in 1987, "Homes Are For Living In", published in 1989, and "Caring for quality: guidance on standards for residential homes for elderly people", published by the Government in 1990, all clearly underline the importance of privacy. Yet not long ago, in January 1991, a document entitled "Not Such Private Places" was published by an organisation called Counsel and Care. It is an indictment of how far we have to go in ensuring appropriate privacy and the proper treatment of people who end up in care or in nursing homes. This report was a study of privacy in private and voluntary residential and nursing homes, mainly in the London area, but I suspect that the conclusions also apply to homes elsewhere in the country and, in many instances, to public sector homes. The report highlights the need for us to address such serious issues, by means of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to read one or two extracts from the Counsel and Care report to emphasise the Opposition's concern about how far we still have to go in ensuring basic standards of decency in the treatment of people in care homes, whether public or private sector. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Moving from being alone to sleeping in the same room as a stranger, performing intimate tasks such as washing and dressing, and in some cases using a commode within sight and hearing of another is a huge breach of privacy. The information on how many homes provide only single rooms is therefore revealing in itself."</p></blockquote>
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"80 per cent. of homes expect a proportion of their residents to share a room … 24 per cent. of residential homes have only single rooms as opposed to a mere 10 per cent. of nursing homes. It seems that the more intensive care a home provides, the less priority is given to privacy."</p></blockquote>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those issues are of fundamental importance and support the Opposition's efforts to persuade the Government to amend the Bill. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only 14 per cent. of private homes provide only single rooms as compared to 41 per cent. in the voluntary sector."</p></blockquote>
It discusses in detail the issue of having to use a commode, effectively in public. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The indignity of having to use a commode in front of another person with whom you have no acquaintance cannot be overstated. It is not unusual for an elderly person to be so intimidated by this prospect that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
wetting the bed becomes a more attractive solution. Sadly our survey revealed that using a commode in a shared room is very much the norm in both residential and nursing home accommodation."</p></blockquote>
The report states that 70 per cent. of all types of homes expect older people to use commodes within the hearing of their room mates. Hon. Members will agree with me that that is completely unacceptable. The report comments that
	<br><blockquote><p>"80 per cent. of nursing homes expect residents to use commodes in shared rooms as compared to 67 per cent. in residential homes. The comparison between private and voluntary homes is also striking, with 77 per cent. of private homes expecting residents to use commodes in shared rooms as against 48 per cent. in the voluntary homes."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to state that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a large proportion of homes, 24 per cent., expect their residents to use commodes in shared rooms where no privacy curtains are available. An alarming number of residential homes, 30 per cent., appear to find this acceptable".</p></blockquote>
You are familiar with the Speaker's Chair, Dame Janet. I understand that in the old days, when there was only one Speaker, it was sometimes necessary for him to make use of a commode and a curtain was provided around the Speaker's Chair. That is going back a long time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not, in this day and age, afford people in care the basic privacy of a curtain when they are carrying out basic bodily functions, that is unacceptable, as I am sure that the Minister will agree. The question is, what do we do about it? On that we may differ. The Government have issued many worthy reports since 1984, but the report that was published only last year shows that not much progress has been made. Some people in the private, voluntary and public sectors need a boot in the appropriate place to remind them that we believe that present practice is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two other points about the report are relevant to the amendment. First,
	<br><blockquote><p>"47 per cent. of nursing homes do not provide locks on bathroom or toilet doors".</p></blockquote>
That is unacceptable. The argument is that people cannot manage to get out if the door is locked. I have visited numerous homes where there are locks that can be opened easily from the outside but avoid people bursting in on somebody who is performing a bodily function. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In two or three cases during our survey we have been shown occupied toilets and no apology is made to the residents concerned."</p></blockquote>
The report is commendable: it draws public attention to an appalling situation. Most members of the Committee are aware of the contents of the report. We have a duty to ensure that the measure will result in some improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to imply that those in the caring professions have complacently sat back and allowed the situation to continue. I commend the magazine "Care Weekly" which has launched campaigns to try to highlight the need for greater privacy. Our amendments hope to continue the work done by that publication and other organisations. I commend to anyone who has not seen it the pamphlet called "Action on Privacy" produced by "Care Weekly", which outlines the measures that should be taken by people in the caring professions. The Bill has a duty to assist that process as a matter of urgency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 refers to the need to identify the forms of restraint that will or might be used. I want to emphasise what I said at the outset when I introduced the amendment. The Bill provides for unforseen placements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
and unforeseen circumstances. We should anticipate that that might be an issue in some of the establishments into which individuals are placed as a result of the arrangements. Anyone who knows, or has worked with, people in care establishments will be aware that certain forms of restraint are occasionally—one hopes very occasionally—inevitable for the protection of the individuals restrained, and for the protection of other residents or of staff. Restraint is a sensitive and difficult issue and, as I am sure my colleagues would agree, needs to be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr said, the Committee is considering issues of general concern in community care. The issue of restraint needs to be flagged because at both national level and local level there is lack of guidance on the use of restraint within a care setting. It will leave people wide open to criticism about the way in which they have dealt with situations if we do not give at least some guidance on what we consider to be reasonable methods of restraint and the circumstances in which they should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, I commend the organisation Counsel and Care, which produced a report in January 1992 entitled "What If They Hurt Themselves?" It outlined some of the serious practical problems facing those who are subjected to what it described and, I am sure, we would also describe as unacceptable forms of restraint in a care setting. It also outlined some of the problems facing staff who have to deal with individuals who occasionally pose problems. The report is lengthy and makes several very important recommendations. I assume that the Minister is familiar with it. However, may I draw to his attention what it says about the need to clarify the law. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department of Health through the Social Services Inspectorate should convene discussions involving all relevant interests, including government law departments, to clarify the legal position of residents and staff in residential care and nursing homes for older people in relation to restraint. The resulting guidance, or if necessary legislation, should cover the following issues: The rights of residents to reasonable freedom of movement within and beyond the establishment in which they live, and how this right can be made explicit in contracts between the resident and the establishment; The right and/or duty of staff under certain circumstances to restrain and detain residents against their will; Limits to the use of drugs employed with the objective of restraining residents; Reasonable protection for staff and managers in situations in which residents in their care cause damage to themselves or others as a result of not being restrained."</p></blockquote>
Those expectations of Parliament are entirely reasonable. I hope that the Minister will take them, into account in the legislation. The amendment simply takes note of the fact that there should be some reasonable agreement on what forms of restraint are available within the establishments in which people may be placed under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 covers similar ground to amendment No. 15. We do not expect the statement proposed in the amendment to use the terminology "allegations of abuse". It would be offputting to a person seeking admission to an establishment to see, described in detail in the agreement, what would happen in the event of allegations of abuse. However, we do expect such a situation to be covered by a clear, written complaints procedure, which is described in principle 7 of the social services inspectorate document entitled "Homes Are For Living In". That takes account of an issue concerning which, in our opinion, the Government have talked but have done little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Amendment No. 19 requires the local authority, when placing a person under the provisions of the Bill, to be satisfied that the nursing and medical needs of that person are properly met. We are worried about the way in which nursing and medical needs are currently being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not long ago I received a complaint from a woman whose mother was in a private care home in a constituency adjacent to mine. The woman thought that a medical practitioner was administering drugs to her mother to restrain her behaviour in an unacceptable way—she used the words "doped up"—with the result that the mother was asleep for most of the time and had lost any sense of personal pride. My constituent was worried because the medical practitioner was not her mother's GP but a co-owner of the home in which her mother was resident. Rather than employ additional care staff, which would have been a cost to those who owned the home, the doctor was prescribing drugs to calm down the mother's behaviour. That worries me and it worried my constituent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make a sweeping statement, but there have been examples of practices in homes run by medical practitioners where an objective view of an individual resident's circumstances has not been taken. Treatment has been administered in a way that raises serious questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to make certain that medical surveillance of residents is undertaken by staff who have no connection with the home and that the residents' medical needs are met by those outside. Although we are restricted in listing all the details, that is the general purpose of the amendment. People who treat residents in homes should have no personal pecuniary interest in the running of the home that might affect the way in which residents are treated. From my knowledge of homes, I believe that the involvement of doctors and nurses who are independent of the home is a crucial factor in monitoring and evaluating the type of care made available in those homes because often they publicly blow the whistle when something is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aim of amendment is to explore the appropriateness of different levels of care now offered in private care homes and private nursing homes. I specify the private sector because of the different rates of income support for those in care homes and those in nursing homes. I have had parliamentary answers from the Department of Social Security that show that, since the Government introduced a significant difference between the amount of money payable as a supplement to the care costs for people in care homes and that for those in nursing homes, there has been a substantial and marked increase in the number of nursing home beds provided. Clearly, those in the private care home industry are cashing in on the additional public finance available to those who are deemed to need nursing care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that this is not strictly the Minister's responsibility but that of the DSS, but he is fairly knowledgeable on the issue and I hope that he can tell me what independent monitoring there is of the process of those moving from care homes to nursing homes at public expense. I can answer the question for him: it is none. That is scandalous. I have received letters from people in West Yorkshire whose relatives have been moved from care homes to nursing homes at the behest of the owner of the home to get more money for that person's care even when he or she did not need nursing care. There is no monitoring of whether a person needs nursing care or whether he or she is receiving it. Millions of pounds of public money is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
wasted, yet the Government are sitting back and doing nothing about it. The amendment points to the need to take account of the appropriate medical and nursing needs of the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the individuals concerned are pushed into a more physically dependent setting. We have no review check or assessment check on when a person moves from social care to nursing care. Often the change is made within the same establishment if it is jointly registered. I asked the DSS how many people had moved from social care to nursing care on the basis of income support claims in the last year available. It did not know. I also asked how many had moved back from nursing care supplement to social care supplement. It did not know that either. I suspect that it would not know because once people receive nursing care supplement they remain under that system. That is wrong and is not in the interests of the individuals concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would never question your selection Dame Janet, but if we had considered amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, which deal with assessment, review and reassessment, we could have examined this serious issue in much more detail. We put people into care and the system then forgets them. We should do something about it not only for the individuals involved but because of the amount of money that we are shunting into wasted expenditure in the private nursing care system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment stresses the need to check the appropriateness of an initial placement to the medical or nursing needs of anyone affected by the Bill. The Royal College of Nursing published in April a report entitled "A Scandal Waiting to Happen" on elderly people and nursing care in residential and nursing homes. The report is well researched and worth reading. It refers to residential care homes and says that there are numerous examples of admission into care of people whose needs could and should have been met at home. It identifies the lack of investment in services such as community nursing as a reason for people being pushed into care. The view of the Royal College of Nursing is that assessment will not cure the problem without proper public investment in community nursing, domiciliary care and the range of services that we discussed on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also refers to the totally inappropriate assessment of nursing needs on admission of people into care and nursing homes. The response to changing health and social needs after admission is completely inadequate. The issue would have been raised in the amendments to which I have just referred. When people are placed in care there should be a review procedure because often their circumstances change shortly after they have been admitted. Their home circumstances may change; it may be possible to rehabilitate them. The present system rewards those who move away from rehabilitation, but it does not reward those who make efforts to rehabilitate people to get them back into the community and into their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The report also states that there are clear shortcomings in the care of people who require nursing care in nursing homes. It says that the availability of qualified and knowledgeable nurses is inadequate. That is unacceptable. The report concludes that the survey leaves
	<br><blockquote><p>"an overwhelming inpression of a false divide between residential and nursing homes. It clearly highlights the fact that nursing needs of people in residential homes (and sometimes nursing homes) are not being met."</p></blockquote>
That false divide is an interesting point because it is also stressed by the British Association of Social Workers, which says that we should get rid of the divide between social and nursing care homes because it is a false divide and it leads to the problems such as I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion of the report by the Royal College of Nursing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The RCN fears that April 1993, and the full implementation of the NHS and Community Care proposals, will not provide a solution to the problems highlighted in this report. The RCN believes that elderly people in residential and nursing homes must have access to qualified nurses. Unless the recommendations contained within this report are acted upon, elderly people will continue to suffer until a major scandal forces change to occur."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 21 is self-explanatory. The principles listed in the amendment are those set out by the Government to underline practice in residential care. We have used the terms that they use—the six key principles that they have mentioned in various documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so much of the Committee's time, but the fact that you have not intervened, Dame Janet, shows that my comments have been relevant to the Bill. My hon. Friends and I do not make party political points about the issue. That is often said, but rarely meant. I mean it sincerely. The issues covered by the Bill are relevant to all, whatever our politics. There is common ground that should be tackled urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people in the private sector do not like me for some strange reason. I cannot understand that—I am always nice to them—but they sometimes believe that I am anti-private sector. The points that I have made apply, in most instances, to the public as well as the private sector. Opposition views are not simply anti-private sector propaganda. I gave an example of appalling lack of privacy where two old ladies were bathed side by side in a local authority home. Fundamentally, we are considering human rights issues. It is time to take seriously the human rights of those who are vulnerable and in care. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should consider whether the details contained in the amendments should be spelt out in the Bill. When the Minister introduced the Bill, he said that its purpose was to allow people in residential care to live as full and independent a life as possible. We would all sympathise with that aim. Do we need to spell out mechanisms in measures to ensure that people have full and independent lives, or can we take it for granted that those who are in the business of residential care make sure that people in their care are as happy and fulfilled as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great advantages in spelling out details of what we wish to secure. The amendments that protect the individual in residential care are wisely grouped together, as are those that protect the authority, with regard to organisations that provide residential care. Both groups of amendments deal with critical aspects of care of the individual. There would be an advantage in spelling out their details in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
I like to believe that in the homes for which, as chair of social services, I have been responsible, all the issues set out in the amendments are properly tackled and that the homes would achieve 100 per cent markings. I am not confident that they would, although the amendments embody the philosophy held by my local authority. It is important to set out not only ideals, but practical details, which, by being enshrined in legislation, will ensure that all those who run private and public residential establishments will take account of them. The amendments, for example, amendment No. 2, would provide knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as possible, people should know exactly what the contract is between themselves and the residential home. They will know about the arrangements for their care and have a say in any alteration of those arrangements. Some amendments deal with privacy, which is enormously important to elderly people, as it is to all of us. There is an inevitable loss of privacy in moving into residential accommodation. How do we retain the element of privacy that each of us needs? How do we make it possible for people to have privacy when they want it? The amendment spells that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequent amendments refer to important issues such as the nature of restraints that are to be allowed, dealing with allegations of abuse and how to meet people's nursing and medical needs. Those issues must be tackled by those responsible for people in their care. Those issues must be dealt with by residential homes, their proprietors or the voluntary society that runs the home and by the authority that makes the arrangements. One could argue that it should be left to the authority to ensure that those arrangements are in place. However, without the force of legislation, it is often difficult for authorities to do so. Those issues are better spelt out than left assumed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a wide range of facilities in the public and private sectors. There are model private sector establishments in my constituency and in Leeds as a whole. I could find others that do not have the same record. The Bill will be an issue in my constituency. There is much public pressure on my local authority to deal with a certain residential establishment which is not registrable. Legislation that made life easier for that establishment would worry many of my constituents. I will be able to return to that matter when we consider establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be aware that it is necessary to control what happens in certain establishments. An elderly person whom I know, a teacher in earlier days, thought that she would be better off in a private residential home than in a local authority setting. She went into a private residential home and found that she could not be cared for adequately without paying certain moneys to individual members of staff. That is wrong in any circumstances, but in that establishment it was a habit to keep a little pocket money to tip members of staff to ensure that one got one's cup of tea in the morning or had help getting dressed. That lady still had her faculties and promptly discharged herself. She subsequently applied to enter a public sector home and is still waiting for admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of other more extreme cases in my authority that led to action being taken. One home, for lighting in communal areas and passageways, used 8-watt light bulbs to cut the use of electricity. Such lighting is unacceptable. In another home, a client was locked in her room overnight because the establishment was not sure that the person in charge on night duty would be able to deal with her. Those
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
are examples of abuse, but we have to be careful to spell out what is essential in the operation of a residential establishment. The amendments would do that; they would introduce better safeguards for elderly residents and those with learning disabilities. The amendments should be accepted by those who wish to improve the system of residential care in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very surprised if the purposes of the amendments were not acceptable to the Government. The amendments describe the safeguards that we would want for ourselves and for any members of our families who were admitted to residential care. I suspect that, if there is any disagreement, it will be about why the safeguards are needed and the means by which they may be implemented. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is beyond question that people in residential care have the right to have their privacy safeguarded. They should be cared for in safe circumstances and information about the appropriate medical and social care for them should be available to them and their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why the amendments would be important improvements to the Bill is that the population of elderly people in residential care has changed dramatically in the past 10 years. Ten years ago, the average age on admission to residential care was about 70; it is now 80-plus. In many ways, that is a termendous tribute to community care and to the capacity of services beyond residential care to look after and support people in their own homes. Residential and nursing homes are caring for people who are much more frail, who may be confused and who require much personal, intimate care than was the case 10 years ago. It is because of the residents' increased vulnerability that we need to step up safeguards to protect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments represent a set of safeguards which echo the concerns of directors of social services. Shortly before the election, a director said to me, "It's not the children at risk who keep us awake at night, it is what might be happening to elderly people in residential care in the local authority's own homes and to the thousands of elderly residents who are cared for, often a long way from home, in private residential and nursing homes."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many ways in which the quality of care that is provided cannot be specified. However, there are ways in which the quality of service can be improved by systematic staff training and development. Important initiatives to improve the training of staff involved in residential care of elderly people have been undertaken, but there is tremendous concern about the inadequacies of training and access to training by staff in the private sector. Given that every elderly person is entitled to the highest quality of care of whatever sort, we must ensure that private sector provision for staff training is similar to that in the local authority sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some months before the election, I worked on six occasions with the night shift staff at a range of residential care homes. That experience taught me several things. I was struck by the aspirations of the staff and their frustration at being unable to put into practice what they knew the residents for whom they cared needed. That discrepancy had a number of causes. The staff felt that they needed to be trained to do more, but the glaring deficiency, especially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
in residential care homes, was the lack of easy access to community services. Local authorities are responsible for placing people in a range of establishments, and they are worried that the supporting services that can guarantee care at home are being cut just as the policy of care at home is beginning to develop momentum. The cuts in community health services have had a particularly devastating effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the amendments deal with the codification of entitlement and expectation. That must be balanced with the need to improve the quality and culture of residential care through training and more systematic development programmes. For many years, there has been apprehension about the quality of residential care. I pay tribute to the excellent work to improve the quality of residential care being done by the social services inspectorate and by some of the organisations to which my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield referred. Those bodies have described what needs to be done. We must create mechanisms to ensure that those good ideas and high expectations are delivered in practice. It is only by specifying what residents can expect, in a way that is understandable to residents, their relatives and the staff at the homes, that we can take one small step towards delivering those expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with the words of an elderly lady living in one of the homes in which I worked. I asked her what she thought of the home, and she paused before saying slowly, "Well, you get used to it, but I suppose you get used to anything." The Bill is an opportunity to do better than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Lynne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments. In relation to amendment No. 2, I hope that the Minister will give an assurance about financial arrangements for people when the Bill is passed. At present, some residents in nursing and residential accommodation do not receive their pocket money element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 deals with the entitlement to privacy. One of my constituents, a lady of 90, told me that she is now being looked after by a relative because she was dissatisfied with the three homes in her area at which she had resided. The amendment makes a point about eating alone. One of my constituent's complaints was that she wanted to eat alone but was denied that facility. She was allocated a table but did not get there on time, and as a punishment was put with residents who suffered from dementia, with its consequent problems. That was apparently the usual punishment for any resident who did not get to the table on time for meals. The amendments seeks assurances that such things will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 relates to restraints. I want assurances on the use of the Buxton chair—sometimes referred to as the naughty chair—which, I understand, is used in many authority homes. Some local councils have said that they will ban its use, but I want the Minister to make a statement on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old lady to whom I referred earlier said that she had witnessed someone being restrained in a Buxton chair. A table is put across it after the person is locked in so a visitor would not be aware that the old person could not get out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 refers to the complaints procedure. There have been problems in Rochdale and in other areas. I complained, through the proper channels, about two or three homes for elderly people in my constituency and relatives have also complained. The home owner was informed about who had complained. I did not mind about
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
that, but relatives are worried that if, say, the daughter or son of a resident is identified the elderly resident could be penalised and there might be further problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the matter of nursing medical needs, to which amendment No. 19 refers, with my local authority. Many people in nursing homes cannot get NHS services and unless the nursing home owner is prepared to provide back-up services—such as physiotherapy, which the residents' general practitioner may have prescribed—those services will not be available. NHS support services are not allowed to go to those homes. I hope that the Minister will clarify that issue and that the law will be changed when the Bill is enacted so that NHS support services can be provided in private nursing accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 21 would tie the above points together by ensuring that the principles are adhered to and monitored. I wholeheartedly support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about unregistered nursing homes, the procedures for establishing what is on offer there and how the homes can be inspected and monitored. Under the Bill, after due assessment of an elderly person local authorities can place that person in a home that is not registered and in which the inspection process is substantially different from that in a registered home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to unregistered nursing homes. I suspect that they would be illegal, as the Minister can confirm or deny. Nursing homes are the subject of legislation, which means that they must be registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I meant to say unregistered homes. The Bill enables payment by local authorities to be made to homes that have three or fewer people. I did not realise that I had referred to them as nursing homes. I am worried that the inspection process will be substantially different in those care establishments from that in registered homes, because homes with four or more residents must be registered and have an inspection procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In talking about improving the quality of community care, we should be looking at the whole aspect of care from the point of view of elderly people, rather than discussing whether they live in a care establishment with two, three or four other people. Individuals in smaller homes should have the same protection, with the same inspection of faculties, as those in larger homes. If the spirit of the Bill is to be enacted, that issue needs careful consideration. The inspection and monitoring of homes with three or fewer people should be exactly the same as that for homes where there are four or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems with inspection. Serious problems can arise in monitoring the facilities of registered homes. I shall give an example of a problem that can arise in nursing homes that are registered by the district health authority. The authority may wish to deregister a home because it has received complaints about the home and because the inspection unit was aware that matters were not right there. If the authority proceeds to deregistration, the nursing home quite rightly has the right of appeal. If the appeal is granted, the health authority can be held to account for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
That creates difficulties with inspection, because some district authorities might be reluctant to be as hard on homes regarding standards as they might otherwise be because they are worried that they may have to pay compensation that they can ill afford. It is important that inspection should be independent in all senses of the word. Will the Minister consider whether it is possible to rectify the problem that can arise with district health authority inspection of nursing homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for tabling this group of amendment is to try to ensure that homes that are not registered are subject to the same inspection and monitoring procedures as those that are. We are asking for detailed information on services and accommodation to be provided. That is very important because the local authority will be paying to ensure that the elderly person whom it places has the best possible quality of care. If we are to enact principles such as privacy, dignity and independence, it is important to know what standards of accommodation and facilities are provided to ensure, after the authority has carried out an assessment and decided that an elderly person needs residential care, that the home's standards will meet the assessment's recommendations and that the agreement can be properly upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that private homes are clear about the local authority's standards. One way of ensuring that is for the local authority to spell out the services that they must provide. It would then be difficult for local authorities to place people in particular homes because there was no set standard. It would be difficult for homes to understand why elderly people were not being placed with them and then to argue or appeal against such non-placements, so our proposal would protect both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is also important for the private sector because the cost of care relates to the capital investment in adapting care establishments. It is important that the cost of care is known. That is possible only if the standards of the local authority are known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately there have been disputes between private residential and private nursing homes and health authorities and social services departments over the grey area of expectations. In my constituency of Stockport, a 56-year-old disabled lady is about to be evicted from one of the nursing homes. The argument is over finance. The charges of care and extra charges have risen to the point where neither the lady who receives DSS benefit nor her relatives can pay them. Part of the problem is that the standards of care and provision in that home were not spelt out as clearly as they should have been; it was not clear whether they would meet her future needs. The home has suggested that I go and see it. I am sure that it is wonderful, but that is not the point. Adequate examination of each case is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot emphasise sufficiently the importance of homes giving detailed information in future. Homes with three or fewer people should give details of what accommodation is available, what records will be kept on a person's progress, what medical advice services are available, including provision for dental care, chiropody, physiotherapy and speech therapy and what training the carers will receive. Even if three or fewer people are in care, caring is no less of a professional activity. Training is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of sanitary facilities such as washbasins, baths and access in an emergency is important. Proper non-slip surfaces and hand-grab rails are needed. Privacy is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
important to maintain people's dignity. Wheelchair or hoist access must be provided. People may be admitted at one level of need, but their condition may rapidly deteriorate and they may require additional adaptations. I would not like people to have to be transferred somewhere else because the home to which they were admitted did not have the necessary adaptations for their deteriorating condition. Elderly people should not be passed from pillar to post. That would not meet the criteria of quality of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small details, which may seem insignificant, are important to preserve people's dignity. Toilet doors must be wide enough for wheelchair access and there should be sufficient room for the door to close and for a person to assist the person in the wheelchair to move from the wheelchair to the toilet. Handbasins should be provided, as well as adequate lighting, heating and ventilation. Individual appliances should be properly inspected and safe to use. They should conform to British standards. Electric lighting should be adequate and special lighting should be provided for people with impaired vision. It is sad that many elderly people suffer from impaired vision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be proper ventilation. The atmosphere should be fresh but not draughty. People should have access to a telephone. It is important for people to feel that they can pick up a telephone and talk to their relatives and receive incoming calls without having to ask if they can use a private telephone. Accommodation should have sufficient room and ceiling space and should maintain privacy. There should be separate sitting and day rooms. Elderly people should not have to stay in bedrooms, merely moving from their bed to a nearby chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furniture and equipment should be comfortable and safe and should use flame-retardant, non-toxic materials that conform to British standards. Many elderly people are afraid of fire because their limited movement makes them feel vulnerable. It is important that they, and we, should know that they are safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same considerations apply to bed materials. Beds need to be comfortable and high enough for elderly people to get in and out of. They should be able to sit on a bed with their feet comfortably on the floor. Surfaces should be capable of being cleaned easily and effectively. Carpets should have proper backing and a non-absorbent pile so that stains are not obvious. Carpet patterns should not be so glaring that elderly people with impaired vision feel that they are looking at obstacles when they see the pattern. All corridors should have handrails. There should be call systems in bedrooms and bathrooms so that people know that they can summon help if something should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kitchens should meet proper health standards, with separate areas for refrigeration, preparation of meat and disposal of food waste. Kitchens should be separate from residential areas. Meals should be balanced and nutritious and include high-fibre foods and fresh milk and fruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ensure high standards for linen, which should be changed often. Personal laundry should be clearly marked to show to whom it belongs. Some homes operate a communal laundry, which is an obnoxious practice. It may be convenient but it takes away people's individuality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can never be enough attention paid to the safe keeping of drugs and medicines, which should be clearly labelled and inspected to ensure that they are in the proper cupboards. Medicines for internal and external use should be kept in separate cupboards. Records should be kept of their administration. Fire safety should be included in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
measure. There should be adequate precautions against the risk of fire and adequate means of escape. Such arrangements should be made in consultation with the fire authority. Elderly people feel safer if they know that precautions have been taken and how they can escape if a fire occurs. Accident prevention should be considered. Floor coverings must be chosen to reduce accidents to a minimum. Clear records of individual residents should be kept. They should specify name, address, dates of admission and leaving, marital status, complaints and allegations of incidents that have been reported. Such records should be kept not in a scruffy folder but in a properly bound book. The same applies to information about complaints procedures. Amendment No. 2(f) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision for the procedure to be followed in the event of any complaint by residents about the accommodation."</p></blockquote>
It is important that there should be a clear procedure. I agree with the hon. Member for Rochdale that residents should feel able to complain without any come-back. Staff should also be able to complain. In a nursing home in my area, several of the staff were sacked after complaining about standards of care. That is appalling. The safeguard of elderly people in homes is that staff are often willing to ensure that proper standards are kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff have been sacked for complaining. That should be investigated at the highest level, because other care staff in the borough may be unwilling to speak out against unacceptable practices in case they are blacklisted and therefore will not be employed by any private home in the area. Such a predicament does not help quality of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statement giving details of the forms of restraint employed by staff."</p></blockquote>
Restraint is a negative way to control behaviour. Attention should be paid to positive ways of encouraging residents to express what they think. Much attention is rightly paid to details of accommodation. But the care that homes provide in, for example, encouraging elderly people to continue to pursue their interests, giving them time to talk about their difficulties and anxieties, is vital. Sadly, in private or public establishments, including hospitals, where that quality of care does not exist, behaviour tends to be controlled negatively through restraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 21 deals with the personal fulfilment of residents. We cannot overemphasise the importance of that point. There is nothing fundamentally different about old people. People do not suddenly change because they are 60 and develop needs that they share with everyone over 60 but with no one below that age. Old people are still people. They continue to experience the same problems as everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those problems are exacerbated by physical disability, increasing vulnerability, and the loss of friends and support systems. That especially affects people in residential homes, because they have been moved from a place where they have lived for a long time. Perhaps that increases their need for emotional care. However, they should always be regarded as people. That is why it is important to consider their personal interests and hobbies, and what they wish to do with the rest of their lives. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
should not be treated simply as objects to be cared for. They need consideration as well as physical care. They should be treated with dignity, as human beings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been helpful. I welcome the contributions, many of which went into detail about various anxieties. We all share concerns which are important to achieving high standards in residential care and the good quality of life that we all want people in residential care to enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the background to the new arrangements for community care, which are primarily designed to improve standards and quality. As hon. Members know, from April next year, local authorities will be required to make an assessment of individual needs for care and to plan a package of care accordingly. The contracts that local authorities place with providers will reflect care plans and specify the services that they are to provide to the resident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However well-meaning the amendments, it is not appropriate or sensible to try to enshrine in primary legislation fine details about services. The amendments deal with matters of good practice, which are more appropriate to guidance and practice material than legislation. It would not be right to fetter local authorities with detailed requirements of that sort. Indeed, as ideas about good practice tend to evolve, sometimes rapidly, it is possible that, by enshrining detailed material in legislation we might constrain the extent to which standards might otherwise be driven up in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other reasons for doubting whether primary legislation is the right vehicle for putting across that rather arbitrary selection of good ideas on good practice. In the first place, arrangements local authorities make under the terms of the Bill will be with only some of the thousands of registered care homes, unregistered homes, hostels, and Abbeyfield homes around the country. The number of contractual arrangements will grow over the years, but it is unlikely that there will even be arrangements with all homes in all the different groups. Therefore, the amendment would have only limited application. Particular requirements would be placed by law on some homes—because the local authority chooses to enter into a contract with them—but not on others, which might, in all other respects, be entirely similar. That would create a degree of confusion and it would mean that the regulatory system, which is founded on the Registered Homes Act 1984 would be weakened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that some of the provisions of the amendments could reasonably be included by local authorities in the contracting process when they are arranging to place people in establishments? Is he aware of the objection of many people in the private sector that the contracting process allows local authorities to specify far too much of what is required from the private sector? Is he aware of the resentment that already exists—wrongly, in my opinion—within the private sector about the processing of contracts so far?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of several concerns of the private sector, which certainly include the one mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. They also include the attitude of many local authorities, which continue, rather sadly, even in the social services, to pursue policies that seem to be based more on doctrine than on the interests of their clients.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Those matters can be addressed in the contractual arrangements between a local authority and the proprietor or manager of a home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Wakefield introduced the amendments, he acknowledged that the problems that the amendments are designed to address are not confined to the voluntary and private sectors; they extend also to local authority establishments—and their effect would be to introduce a form of discrimination in favour of local authority homes, which would work against the independent sector. I do not suppose that that was the hon. Gentleman's intention, but that would be the effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point relating to the homes covered by the Bill. But, if voluntary and private sector homes were subject to the provisions of the amendments, surely, under the arm's length inspection process operated by the local authorities, which must treat all homes on the same basis, the private and voluntary sector could insist that the local authority subject its homes to the same requirements, if any of them were sufficiently small, that is not an escape clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Parliament sets out guidelines, although the provisions of the Bill do not apply to local authority homes—because of the way in which the inspection process works and the way in which the system will operate from April 1993—local authorities would not be able to reject them and adopt lower standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite right. The amendments would impose statutory obligations on a certain group of homes, not including local authority homes. There would be no section under which independent sector establishments could insist on local authority homes meeting certain standards. They could certainly urge them to do so, but in respect of local authority homes we would be left to rely on precisely the requiremens in terms of good practice, guidance and so on, which I believe should apply across the board. The amendments would introduce a two-tier system, which would not be satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the two-tier system that the Minister mentioned already exists. The powers of a registration officer are limited in terms of part III accommodation. The present system discriminates against the private and independent sector. That is nonsense, but it is Government policy. I could not understand why the Government's position on the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 was to have arm's length inspection based in local authorities. The Opposition's position, which was opposite to what one might expect, was that there should be a commission, independent of local authorities, to ensure consistency of standards within the public and the private sectors. The Minister is contradicting his Government's policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in how the hon. Gentleman advances his argument. He appears to be saying that he is opposed to a two-tier system, having just introduced a series of amendments which would reinforce any unequal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to the amendments for two reasons: first, they go into too much detail—far more than is appropriate for primary legislation—and, secondly, they would not tackle the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
acknowledges exist in the local authority sector. It is not difficult to think of ways in which the Registered Homes Act 1984 could be improved. It has been in operation for seven years; things have moved on during that period, and it is to be expected that several changes for the better could be made. However, the Bill is not the right vehicle for those improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the most part I think that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would acknowledge that standards of residential care are extremely high. That is a tribute to the professionalism of the people involved and to the effectiveness of the existing regulations. The great merit of the Registered Homes Act is that it is not a detailed and prescriptive piece of legislation; it provides a framework which allows standards in residential care homes to be maintained at a satisfactory level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister invites us to agree that standards are universally high. My experience is that standards are extremely variable. The vast majority of homes are very good, but there are a small number of homes—they are primarily in the private sector but there are a few in the public sector—in which standards are unacceptably low. The reason for the variability is that informal or non-statutory codes of practice and the existing statutory inspection and registration procedures are not picking up the homes in which standards slide. That is because the statutory procedures require inspectors to inspect and measure those things that are relatively easy to measure—for example, room sizes, numbers of toilets, how drugs are regulated, and so on. They do not inspect what is at the heart of care: the relationship between human beings—the care: and the cared for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have noticed that recent interventions have been getting progressively longer. Interventions, by their nature, should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. I did not say that standards were universally high. Those were the hon. Gentleman's words, not mine. I said that standards were, for the most part, high. I believe that that is the case, although I acknowledge—we all have evidence of it—that there are exceptions, which we want urgently to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to deal with the matters referred to by the hon. Member for York through primary legislation. The relationship between carers and residents, for example, is essentially a matter of good practice. A Bill cannot contain everything which would govern that relationship, nor would it be sensible to try to include it. The right way is to use guidance material to emphasise good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope in the near future to set up a review of "Home Life", the code which was referred to earlier and which was produced some eight years ago and now clearly needs updating. I hope that, in carrying out that review it will be possible to take account of some of the points made in the debate.
