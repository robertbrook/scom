	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [3 December]:</i> No. 137, in page 3, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A)(a) The Secretary of State must give three months' notice of his intention to make an order made under subsection (1) above; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) such an order may only commence at the start of the financial year.'.—[	<i>Mr. Tony Lloyd.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. It may have been drawn to your attention that on Friday, the Secretary of State sent letters to certain directors of education claiming that they were exercising undue pressure on parents taking part in ballots to decide whether schools should apply for grant-maintained status. I shall not go into the details of that exercise in intimidation but I draw to your attention one paragraph in the letter that is relevant to the Bill. The letter sent to Cleveland challenges its claim that the county council
	<br><blockquote><p>"may only be allowed to sell its services to grant-maintained schools for two years".</p></blockquote>
The letter sent by the Department for Education states that the White Paper said that the services that could be provided would be clarified in clause 244. That clause places a time limit of two years from the time that the order is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall soon debate clauses to which clause 244 is relevant. Have you been notified of Government amendments to that clause, Sir John? The restrictions in the clause as drafted will be severe and it will not necessarily be possible to provide the services to grant-maintained schools implied in the DFE's letter. The Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education, who is not present, said in a letter dated November this year that local authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"may sell services to designated 'public bodies'"—</p></blockquote>
that is, grant-maintained schools—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but only if in so doing they are operating at the margin of capacity".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady but what she said cannot possibly be a point of order. These are matters that will be raised in the course of our debates. She should restrain herself until that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir John. I understand your difficulties, and I am sure that you understand the difficulties facing hon. Members who may wish to table amendments to the next chapter of the Bill. We need clarification of the position of local authorities in providing services to grant-maintained schools. The position outlined by Ministers is contradictory and those
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
who wish to table amendments are in difficulty. If Ministers are not willing to clarify the position relating to local authority services and the restriction that they operate "only at the margin" of their capacity the solution might be to take clause 244 earlier than scheduled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister heard what the hon. Lady said and we should leave it at that for the present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I appeal, through you, to the Minister and give an example of the importance of this issue. At least one school in Cheshire buys its pay roll services from Lincolnshire county council. Clause 244 would not allow a school in Cheshire to continue to buy its pay roll services off Lincolnshire after two years because the two authorities do not have a contiguous boundary. I appeal to you, Sir John, to use your authority to ask the Minister to consider seriously taking clause 244 earlier than is presently intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are all points that should be made in the course of our proceedings. We are still a long way from clause 244, but I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. We should now proceed with amendment No. 137.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with orders commencing at the start of the financial year. My authority of Cambridgeshire has pointed out that it causes administrative problems if schools opt out throughout the year. It is difficult for budgets and planning, and for arranging contracts for teachers and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read a relevant paragraph from the Cambridgeshire submission, in which the director of education stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Allowing schools to opt out at three different stages in a school year makes effective financial planning impossible: it would be better to arrange, as in the NHS, that schools should opt out in annual waves, timed to coincide with the start of the financial year."</p></blockquote>
I commend that suggestion to the Minister. Opposition Members have made it clear that we should prefer schools not to opt out. However, if one does, it is easier for the local education authority to cope with handing over a large chunk of aministration if it has to do so on an annual basis. Arranging opt outs in a series of waves, as happens in the national health service, would make the planning process simpler and easier to co-ordinate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Sir John. It is reassuring to see you presiding over the Committee again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, the amendment is unnecessary. The simple and straightforward reason is that the nature of the process—by which a school holds a ballot and presents proposals that are considered by the Secretary of State and are then subject to a period of objections—means that there is hardly an element of surprise when that school secures final approval and is able to fulfil the conditions of clause 7. That cannot happen suddenly or overnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, paragraph (b) of amendment No. 137 would mean that, given certain timings of the holding of a ballot and the submission of a proposal, there could be a possible delay of 14 or 15 months before the process is started. I am sure that the amendment was not tabled with mischevious intent but there are certain circumstances—I have not worked out the exact number of days that would be involved—in which, if a ballot were held in the early
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
part of the year and the process were finalised just after April, it would effectively be another 12 months before the Secretary of State could invoke the provisions of clause 7. That is an unreasonable and unacceptable delay in what would be a familiar process, in which the prevailing local circumstances would be well understood. Clause 248(4) provides for the Secretary of State to make different arrangements where it is necessary to take account of special circumstances. That allows a flexibility for local circumstances that members of the Committee should find reassuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The smooth and effective working of clause 7 is in the Secretary of State's interest. When we reach the final stage of the schools' proposals and their approval by the Secretary of State, he will wish to ensure the efficiency of the arrangements that invoke clause 7. It is unnecessary to include set deadlines of three months and the start of the financial year in the clause. They could delay the process unnecessarily and make it less workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the transitional stages are smooth and effective for local education authorities, as well as for individual schools. LEAs should, therefore, be able to effect financial planning and budgeting in a way that allows the efficient use of resources. How does the Minister intend to safeguard that practical interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the run-up to the final stages of the process, notice will be given of the probability that the threshold will be crossed. When the threshold is crossed, the Secretary of State will wish to be satisfied, when making the order to effect clause 7, that the transition will be smooth, to ensure that planning and the provision of places is effectively done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes I believe that the Opposition imagine that we are in confrontation. We are not. Ensuring that education provisions works as well as possible is the common ground and mutual interest of all parties. Although we differ about how that is to be achieved, given the principles of the Bill, which we approved on Second Reading, and the clauses that we have already considered, it is self-evidently in the interests of the Secretary of State, pupils and everyone who is involved in education to ensure that the important transitional provisions work as smoothly as possible. That is the ultimate safeguard against peremptory actions by a Secretary of State that would disrupt local provision of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary, and counterproductive, especially paragraph (b), which could delay the process unreasonably. The Committee should reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister with interest. We shall not press this technical amendment to a vote. The tone of the Minister's words is reassuring. I accept his desire for consensus. However, the Secretary of State's actions are more important than what is said in Committee. We anticipate them with anxiety. We must ensure that, in future, the Secretary of State operates in a way that is consistent with the Minister's assurances that the Secretary of State does not intend to disrupt LEAs or cause them problems. The debate will continue in the confines of the Committee and later, on the Floor of the House. The Minister's good intentions will be put to the test when the first LEA finds itself with a funding agency
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
about to come into operation. We shall watch with interest and concern to ensure that the Minister's words are fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 4, line 3, leave out '10' and insert '25'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled the amendment and selected 25 per cent, as the trigger point at which the Secretary of State should have the power to make an order, if he desires, so that the responsibility for providing school places in an LEA should be shared between the funding agency and the LEA. We have tabled the amendment to probe the Government's thinking about the choice of 10 per cent. as the trigger point. They have chosen 75 per cent. as the other trigger point—that at which the Secretary of State could issue an order to give the funding agency total responsibility for the provision of school places in an LEA area once that proportion of pupils was in grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be an argument for the symmetry of the arrangement: if 25 per cent. goes alongside the 75 per cent., the trigger point is equidistant from zero and 100 in each case. More importantly, we feel that 10 per cent. is too low a point at which to have the trigger mechanism operating at the behest of the Secretary of State. We realise that it is not a compulsory power that the Secretary of State has: he will use his discretion as to when he thinks that the 10 per cent. must come into operation. We wish to probe the 10 per cent. point because a number of its factors must be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know at what point in the year the 10 per cent, would come into operation: would it be as a result of the annual returns of form 7? Once the forms were in, the Secretary of State might study them. In an LEA in which more than 10 per cent. of the pupils were in grant-maintained schools—probably in the secondary sector as it is more likely to happen there, and has happened there already—would that be the set of figures on which the Secretary of State would make a decision? Would he wait until September, when the schools have done their own enumeration of the number of pupils in schools at that point? Would he use a September enumeration as confirmation of the form 7 returns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would the Secretary of State do if the number of pupils making up the 10 per cent. was on the margin? In the London borough of Lewisham LEA, one of the 12 schools constitutes 15 per cent. of the secondary school population. If one school out of 12 constituted more than 10 per cent. of pupils, would the Secretary of State be prepared to make an order to give the funding agency joint responsibility for providing school places? Would he restrict the order to the secondary sector, or would it apply to both the secondary and the primary sector? Does he intend to maintain a separation of the two sectors when making such orders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lewisham also has three secondary schools that are on the verge of constituting 10 per cent. of the pupil population. In the form 7 returns for January 1992, the secondary roll in Lewisham was 10,528. One school had 1,115 pupils, another had 1,008 and another had 1,099. In September 1992, the actual number in those schools was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
1,192, 1,131 and 1,199 respectively in a secondary school roll of 11,276. Each of those schools is at the margins of the 10 per cent. trigger point. The three schools experienced a reduction in numbers as the term went on: some of the pupils at 16-plus decided to leave school when they found jobs or places on a training course. On top of that, the overall numbers in Lewisham increased because places had been filled in other secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten per cent. is a low figure and in a small education authority, several secondary schools could have pupil numbers on the margins of 10 per cent. of the total pupil population. School populations fluctuate so that the pupil population of grant-maintained schools may be above and below the 10 per cent. mark during the year. We believe that a higher trigger point of 25 per cent. would be better. There would be less of an argument at the margins because there would be more pupils in the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear from the clause which secondary school pupils would count. Local authority schools, grant-maintained schools and voluntary-aided schools would clearly be counted, but would city technology colleges and sixth form colleges be included in the LEA figure—many comprehensive schools have sixth forms, but there are also many sixth form colleges? What about pupils of secondary school age who are in special schools? Which pupils will be included in the count, especially in the secondary sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What date will be used for the 10 per cent. trigger point? Will any other considerations be taken into account for the mechanism to be brought into action? I hope that the Minister will clarify the Department's thinking on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to place on record my support for the amendment. I am opposed to the Bill and would prefer no entry point for the funding authorities. However, the amendment would at least delay the point at which the funding authority would come into being. That would have two advantages. First, it would delay the division and chaos. That view has the support of many people outside the Committee, and even of some Conservative Members. It is interesting to reflect on the remarks of the hon. Member for Crosby (Sir M. Thornton) who is the chairman of the Select Committee on Education. He recently described the Bill as a
	<br><blockquote><p>"recipe for at best confusion and at worst chaos".</p></blockquote>
He therefore shares my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent press reports have quoted the chief education officer of Wandsworth, Donald Naismith. He is a frequent supporter of Government proposals and it is interesting to note that he recently announced his resignation. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government thinks that these reforms will last 25 years. I don't think they will last 25 months."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This sounds like a Second Reading speech. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now direct his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your direction, Sir John, but my point is that the amendment specifically defers the onset of phase 2, and thus delays the onset of the division and chaos that I believe will be created by the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to discuss why it is important to delay the onset of phase 2, so I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Sir John. It would give the Minister and his colleagues more time to be a little clearer about how phase 2 will operate. Over the weekend, I reviewed in detail the speeches made on Second Reading and in Committee. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
shall give two quotes that show the total confusion in the minds of Ministers. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be two bodies—the LEA and the funding agency—with parallel but not shared responsibilities."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 635.]</p></blockquote>
However on 1 December, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have no difficulty accepting the concept of shared responsibility".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 391.]</p></blockquote>
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two quotations illustrate Ministers' confusion about the operation of the two bodies and how they will co-exist. Delaying the onset of phase 2 will allow the confusion to be sorted out and clarify the position. It would also delay the time in which there will be duplication of effort and waste of resources. It would give the Minister time to reflect on his comment in our third sitting. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In other words, the duty of the FAs to secure sufficient school places need not, and should not, operate where it is economically more sensible for an LEA to make provision in that way."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 19 November 1992; c. 82.]</p></blockquote>
It would be more economical and efficient for the local education authority to continue to take responsibility for the provision of school places well beyond the 10 per cent. limit in the Bill. An extension of that limit, as the amendment proposes, would reduce the time in which there would be duplication and misuse of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have argued about the lack of resources and their misuse in the education system for some time. At our previous sitting, the Minister kindly referred to the integrity of my party's campaign in the last general election. I hope that the Minister will also reflect on the comments about the lack of resources in education made by the hon. Member for Crosby the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education. He spoke about the pressures on school budgets and, as 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> reported, he concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To be told that you have the freedom to choose is a sick joke when the only choice is between losing teachers or slashing an already reduced sum for capitation."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment, which would delay the onset of phase 2 and the confusion, chaos and division that it will create. It would delay, too, the onset of the duplication of effort and wasted resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes think that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) believes that if he says "chaos and confusion" often enough it will come about. It is a sad insight into his attitude—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman want to say it again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not constantly saying it; it is being said by large numbers of people, many of whom are traditional supporters of the Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party is rightly renowned for the freedom and flexibility that it gives its supporters to speak out on important matters. The Conservative party is the oldest party in continuous existence in the free world and has been endorsed four times in succession by the British electorate. One reason for its abiding resilience is that flexibility. It is puzzling that the hon. Gentleman, who masquerades under the label of Liberal, criticises that phenomenon. He is about to explain it to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the slightest. The label under which the Minister says that I masquerade is Liberal Democrat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes it even more puzzling. The hon. Gentleman seems to think that the free expression of a wide variety of views is to be deplored. I am much more relaxed about that and can take it in my stride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not for the first time, the hon. Member for Bath has let the cat out of the bag. He said that he supports the amendment simply because it will delay the date on which the funding agency for schools begins to operate. That is fine and I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman's integrity, as he has been open about his intention. However, neither he nor the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) have grasped that local education authorities will not lose their section 8 duties at the 10 per cent. threshold, nor at a 25 per cent. threshold. Those duties remain in the parallel regime that seems to puzzle and upset Opposition Members so much. I admit that we have been pushed by some of our colleagues to lower the threshold to 5 per cent., and I suppose it could be lowered to 0 per cent. if the argument were pursued further, although I doubt that Opposition Members would want that. However, the Government judged that the 10 per cent. level was right because, to keep faith with the schools that have balloted freely to leave the maintained sector, we must assure them that the new planning regime will be operational at a reasonably early, realistic stage. To pitch the level as high as possible to cause delay would be to risk not keeping faith with the parents who have chosen to take their schools out of the control of local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the Minister's use of the phrase "new planning regime", which would become operational at the 10 per cent. level. I can understand that when higher percentages are involved, but what powers are implied by instituting a new planning regime at 10 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gosh, I though that we had gone through this endlessly already, but apparently not. I was speaking of the parallel regime that so bothers Opposition Members. The hon. Gentleman, who has sat faithful and mostly awake through our many and long sittings, should understand that the essence of having the funding agency for schools lies in its ability to plan the provision of places in the grant-maintained sector alongside the continuing planning and provision of places in the LEA-maintained sector under the LEAs' continuing section 8 duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) has raised the point, because it is the reason why the amendment is unacceptable. In the words of the hon. Member for Bath, it would delay the implementation of the planning function of the funding agency for schools. Therefore, it might prejudice the effectiveness of the overall planning regime that we are trying to establish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am being a little obtuse this morning, but I want to get this matter crystal clear. Will the Minister confirm that the funding agency's role will be to plan which school next becomes grant-maintained? Will it plan the campaign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no; the hon. Gentleman is not on good form this morning. He knows that that is not the case and he is being a bit mischiveous, but I shall indulge him, briefly. Whether or not a school becomes grant-maintained is a matter to be decided only by parents at that school, through the balloting procedure. Whether or
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
not the funding agency for schools decides that a new grant-maintained school might be an appropriate way in which to provide the places needed in that area would be a matter for the funding agency under the regime of planning, submitting proposals for approval by the Secretary of State and then allowing time for objections, which the Committee has discussed several times. I hope that the regime is clear, but does the hon. Gentleman want to try again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. That has clarified matters, but I want to make sure that my understanding is absolutely correct. Will the Minister confirm that the funding agency for schools may plan an extra or a new school because it thinks that a number of parents exist who, although in a minority in the LEA schools, still want to move into the grant-maintained sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Planning would be based on the exchange of information that is described in clause 5, which we discussed earlier in our deliberations—it seems like 100 years ago. There will be free exchange of information about demography, numbers on rolls and the need for places. Due account of that will be taken by local education authorities, in their continuing planning function for the LEA-maintained sector, and by the funding agency for schools in the grant-maintained sector, which will grow at the rate at which parents ballot and schools decide to opt out. The planning process will be completed under the dual regime that clause 7 sets out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the threshold is delayed from 10 to 25 per cent., the planning process will not be available to the grant-maintained sector, which will float about, unplanned and uncontrolled. The hon. Member for Hemsworth generously said earlier in our proceedings that, once a school had freely balloted to become grant maintained, he wanted it to operate in the best possible way, in the interests of the pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that when the 10 per cent. threshold is reached, the funding agency can start to plan for new grant-maintained schools, when local education authorities control 90 per cent. of education provision? Will the responsibilities of LEAs and the funding agency be parallel and shared, or simply parallel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question is yes, the answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is, whatever turns him on. I shall not get hung up on semantics. I was impressed, as always, by the Secretary of State's words, which the hon. Member for Bath quoted. Whatever the Secretary of State says must be right. Perhaps I have expressed what he said differently. Perhaps the Opposition really struggle with the concept of a set of parallel responsibilities, which never meet, as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), who is a mathematician, pointed out. Sharing is a matter of interpretation and semantics. I shall not be seduced into participating in that argument. It would be futile, even if I had a dictionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the Minister's last point, what will happen when 75 per cent. of pupils are in the grant-maintained sector and 25 per cent. of pupils remain in the LEA sector? As I understand it, the funding agency for schools will be entirely responsible for planning in both sectors, even though some schools will have opted positively to stay in the LEA sector. Is it fair to pupils

	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
whose parents have opted for them to remain within the LEA for the funding agency to plan for them when LEAs will not plan for the 10 per cent. of schools that become grant maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is right for me to be drawn into a discussion about what happens after the 75 per cent. threshold is reached. Perhaps I can do that on another occasion. But we are discussing 10 or 25 per cent. I have a note about the hon. Lady's question, which I could read to the Committee, but I am cautious about order, as I know that you would expect me to be, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister does not want to get hung up on semantics; is he willing to get hung up on some arithmetic? At the 10 per cent. point, 10 per cent. of parents will have balloted for grant-maintained status. On average, the turn out for such ballots is 60 per cent. and about 60 per cent. of parents vote in favour. Therefore, 3·6 per cent. of the population could cause the funding agency to share responsibility with the LEA. Will the Minister reflect on the rights and views of the other 96·4 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that it is like the final seat in the Irish election, which determined who was to govern the country. In any democratic system there is always a cross-over point—I am sure that we should not get too worried about that. We all know about recounts in our system: it is theoretically possible that if there were a one-seat majority in the House of Commons, the last three of four people in a recount who gave rise to a seat changing hands could determine the Government of the entire country. I understand that, but if the hon. Gentleman is uncomfortable with that, he may wish to return to much wider constitutional issues. I do not think that it is a problem in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for pursuing him, albeit briefly, on the issue of semantics. It is inadequate for the Minister to say that he is not interested in semantics: we are debating a Bill with words on the page and we need to know what they mean. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to reflect on what he said only a few minutes ago—that if the Secretary of State said it, it must be right. In that context, will he reflect on two statements made by the Secretary of State on 9 November. He stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I expect collaboration between the LEA and the funding agency to ensure that there are sensible proposals to deal with the need for more school places."</p></blockquote>
In the next column, he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A little healthy competition will be no bad thing for some LEAs."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 634–5.]</p></blockquote>
Again, I am confused about the meaning of those two statements. The Minister obviously has a cracker of an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now in a position to help the Committee. People with dictionaries have come to my rescue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At stage 2, there is a shared responsibility exercised by parallel duties. Both the FAS and the LEAs have a shared responsibility for securing sufficient places. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I hope that Opposition Members are listening to me—they have been asking for the answer and I am now giving it to
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
them. I suggest that they might wait until tomorrow and reflect on my words in 	<i>Hansard,</i> because they are the definitive answer and, I hope, the final one to the questions that have been eating up Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FAS and the LEAs have separate, but parallel duties for achieving sufficient places. The LEA has the section 8 duty and the FAS has a similar, but different duty under paragraph 3 of schedule 2. I hope that that has laid to rest, once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, but I want to make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but I have been waiting patiently during the previous six or so interventions to make a point about the change of the trigger point from 10 to 25 per cent. About 15 minutes ago, before the round of interventions began, the Minister said that, once the 10 per cent. trigger mechanism came into operation, the funding agency would be responsible for planning school places alongside the LEA. Through the sharing of their information, they could make proposals for the creation of new schools. The funding agency could make a proposal for a grant-maintained school, which would have nothing to do with a parental ballot because it would be an entirely new school. Just under 90 per cent. of all pupils could be with the LEA and yet the funding agency could still propose a new school without a parental ballot. If there were a dispute between two bodies with parallel duties, but under different sections, the Secretary of State would have to make a judgment. Would he not be prejudiced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the fact that it is constitutionally impossible for the Secretary of State to be prejudiced—I shall pass over that—the hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. He is asking by implication for a ballot of parents of a new school. That is a little tricky. How can parents of a new school be balloted if the school does not exist and there are no pupils? That is patently impossible. Therefore, the procedure is as the hon. Gentleman outlined. A local education authority can propose to establish a new school without a ballot of parents because there are no parents, so a funding agency should similarly be able to do so. We must ensure proper and adequate provision of school places, whether by enlargements or new schools. To achieve that, the Bill gives the funding agency those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment because the delay that the hon. Member for Bath wants would also delay the establishment of proper school provision in the grant-maintained sector. That is unacceptable to me and, I hope, to my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has repeated the point that I made earlier, but which he avoided answering.

	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
He said that if 10 per cent. of pupils were in opt-out schools there would not be proper provision of places unless the funding agency were established. The same argument applies at the other end of the scale. If 75 per cent. of pupils were in grant-maintained schools, the 25 per cent. in LEA schools would not be properly planned for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not strictly true. The LEA would continue to be responsible for the 25 per cent. of places under its control, unless the LEA asked—as is possible under the Bill—to relinquish its responsibility. That is possible and even probable in a wide range of circumstances, but as long as schools have not balloted to leave the LEA sector, they will continue to be the responsibility of the LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, will the Minister explain what the 75 per cent. threshold will trigger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am being led astray. I shall answer very briefly because we shall certainly return to the point later—I am being given a message of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence is that the initiative and the primary responsibility for the provision of new places will pass to the funding agency for schools after the 75 per cent. threshold has been reached. The LEA will have an important residual responsibility for the provision within its sector, but it cannot propose the establishment of new schools. The key factor after the 75 per cent. threshold has been reached is that new school provision will become the province of the funding agency for schools. The LEA will still have responsibility for the provision of education in schools that have balloted not to become grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still confused. Will the Minister explain precisely what he means? I understood him to say earlier that in phase 2, any new schools would be under the funding agency for schools; they would be grant-maintained schools. I am uncertain about the change that takes place at the 75 per cent. trigger and about the difference between local education authority responsibility and funding agency responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In stage 1, the funding agency for schools will not be in operation and so could not provide new schools. In stage two, with the parallel regimes between 10 per cent. and 75 per cent., both the LEA and the funding agency for schools can make proposals for new schools. Those would then be subject to objections and go to the Secretary of State for final approval, if necessary. Under stage 3, only the funding agency for schools can make provision for, and open, new schools. The LEA will no longer be able to do so. I hope that that has helped the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, but I am trying desperately to bring this part of our proceedings to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the problem is that the 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. trigger levels seem arbitrary. The Minister has not offered a critical analysis of the reason for the inclusion in the Bill of those figures. Will the Minister explain why the 10 per cent. trigger allows the funding agency for schools to become involved in the provision of new school places, yet LEAs are taken out of the picture
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
altogether when the 75 per cent. level is reached, even though that means that the LEAs retain 25 per cent. of the responsibility? Why is the level 10 per cent. for the funding agency, and 25 per cent. for the LEAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we judge that to be about right. That is the whole point of this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay close attention to the Minister's desire to sit down soon, but I have one urgent question that needs to be answered in this debate. Will the Minister say exactly who counts as pupils in the secondary sector within an LEA region? If an LEA has a city technology college, will the students at that college count as secondary pupils? What about pupils undertaking special education in special schools and students at a sixth-form college?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my efforts to sit down I realise that I neglected to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions, so I shall do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Students at CTCs will not count, as, legally, those institutions are independent schools. The pupils at special schools will not count either, because more often than not they are drawn from a wide geographical area and so would lack the identify with the LEA planning area that one would normally expect. Finally, from April 1993, sixth-form colleges will be part of the further education sector rather than the school sector, so their students will not count as secondary pupils either. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have given—at unusual length—I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has come to that conclusion. There is a symmetry and a certain justice in the 25 per cent. and 75 per cent. trigger points. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) raised a point of natural justice about having faith with the parents who stay with the LEA after the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached. They should get the same treatment as that received by grant-maintained pupils and parents at the 10 per cent. level. If the Minister were to advocate that the second trigger point should be set at 90 per cent., we could agree that that figures showed a symmetry and a similarity of approach. However, the 10 per cent. level does not provide symmetry or natural justice, and we intend to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 4, line 3, after 'cent.', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'on the third Thursday of January in the year in which the order is made.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 180, in page 4, line 3, after 'cent.', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and likely to remain so until the first day of the following September.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised some of the issues relating to the amendment in the previous debate. The amendment would place in the Bill the specific time at which the trigger should be activated and thus avoid a dispute about how the Secretary of State uses his power. Annual return form 7 would be appropriate, although amendment No. 180 recognises that there may be variations by the following September. The Secretary of State would thus have some discretion to ensure that the numbers in the school on the form 7 return were not inflated the following September. If we must have the rather messy trigger arrangement, the form 7 return is the basis on which the Secretary of State should decide to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a couple of matters arising from the amendment? First, both the amendments insert a phrase immediately after the word "cent.". They cannot both be inserted at the same place. Secondly, amendment No. 180 includes the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to remain so until the first day of the following September".</p></blockquote>
Who is to judge whether that will be so? What criteria will be used in making such a judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is, first, to establish that form 7 should be used when the Secretary of State makes a judgment about the 10 per cent. trigger mechanism. Amendment No. 180 refers to the way in which school rolls can change. Sometimes, there are significant differences in the numbers at the beginning of the school term. Most schools do not begin the new school year on the first day of September. However, by that time, the heads of schools and local education authorities usually know the likely number of pupils for the first term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) intervened, I mentioned that the Secretary of State would have to use his discretion. If the amendment were accepted, an LEA that found that the returns for the likely school population in September differed significantly from form 7 returns would inform the Secretary of State. Such a discrepancy is not likely to happen often. The use of the form 7 returns is important. The Secretary of State must receive information that is factual, acknowledged and not the subject of dispute if a local authority is unhappy about when the 10 per cent. mechanism is triggered. Has the Department asked independent consultants to evaluate the reliability of the information in form 7 returns? As far as we know, the information is reliable. However, mistakes can be made, and a reassurance that the generally perceived view of form 7 reliability is valid would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our earlier debate on the 10 per cent. trigger mechanism showed its importance in activating the funding agency's parallel duty with the LEA for the provision of places in LEA areas. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that the operation of the system for appeals against the timing of the trigger mechanism will be soundly based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked a reasonable question to which the answer is yes, we anticipate using form 7 returns to calculate the 10 per cent. trigger point. I am uneasy about the amendments because, in writing into the Bill two precise dates, they would tie the hands of future Secretaries of State. For example, in future it might be judged reasonable to move away from form 7 data, or the January date. Flexibility is desirable. Although I am satisfied that form 7 information is as good as we are likely to get, I do not want to preclude holding a different view in the future. If, for example, we commission the work that the hon. Member for Bridgend reasonably suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are unnecessarily specific about the source and form of the information and the precise dates in the year on which the important judgment is to be made. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we would base the trigger point on the form 7 data. However, I ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider the wisdom of pinning down as precisely as the amendment does, in terms of absolute dates, the way in which that information is arrived at. All future Secretaries of State, who will be responsible for the operation of the system, will need to have the flexibility to ensure—through various means, including those suggested by the hon. Gentleman—the reliability and validity of the information that is available. For that reason, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am entirely happy with that reply. The Minister's argument could apply to any specification in any measure, so that any Secretary of State would have discretion about the way in which to operate. Given the existence of form 7, the annual return, it would have been desirable to include in the Bill the requirement for advice to be given about the system's operation.

I shall not divide the Committee on the amendment, but I remind the Minister that, although a recent ruling stated that 	<i>Hansard</i> may be quoted in court in order to ascertain what a Minister meant, some people in both Houses of Parliament consider that that would give judges too much power. The Minister has confirmed that he would be likely to use form 7 in making judgments about the 10 per cent. trigger point, but he also referred to the importance of the decision. While I shall withdraw the amendment, we shall seek further clarification on the matter and may return with a different proposal at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 4, line 3, after 'pupils', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'who are resident in the area and'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Commmittee will support the amendment, especially given what the Minister said in a previous debate about the way in which special schools take their pupils from a wide geographical area. The amendment would ensure that the decision about grant-maintained status and the trigger point are based on pupils who are resident in an LEA, rather than on pupils who attend school in an LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traditionally, local government is responsible, first and foremost, to its residents rather than to people who use the facilities that it provides. That is also true of schools. The LEA, under section 8 of the Education Act 1944, has a duty to provide sufficient schools for its area. That is the basis for the amendment. However, hon. Members will know that schools in LEA areas also contain pupils who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
come from other areas and boroughs. Established procedures exist by which the cost of educating those pupils can be recouped from their home authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require that the pupil count for the entry and exit points should be calculated from the figures for resident pupils attending grant-maintained schools, rather than from the figures for pupils attending local authority schools in general. The amendment is straightforward, in that the information required to make that calculation is already available—it is used to make the necessary financial transfers relating to recruitment and for the Department of the Environment to calculate the standard spending assessments, which are based on locally resident pupils. The Government already use that definition to calculate the SSA and to determine recruitment; it would therefore seem logical to use the same system when taking decisions about grant-maintained schools. There would be no practical problems in producing such information and calculating the percentage of pupils in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important for other reasons. I mentioned the London factor in previous debates. Without the amendment, the Bill's effect in London would be stark. My hon. friend the Member for Bridgend spoke earlier about Lewisham schools. Records show that nearly 20 per cent. of young people in Lewisham and the surrounding boroughs travel in and out of those boroughs to school. The amendment would discount those pupils who attend schools in boroughs other than those in which they live. The first responsibility of an LEA is to the people who live within its boundary. Pupils from outside the borough who are recruited to grant-maintained schools within its boundaries should not be taken into account. Two examples highlight a problem which I do not think the Secretary of State anticipated. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and rectify that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first example is drawn from Camden—I use data available from January this year—which had just over 10,000 pupils in its secondary schools. Of those pupils, 1,402 attended the Jewish free school; that is 14 per cent. of Camden secondary school pupils. However, only 54 pupils at the Jewish free school are resident in the borough of Camden. They represent only 3·9 per cent. of Camden's school population. The Jewish free school is the only Jewish secondary school in London and its pupils obviously come from a wide area. The logic of the Minister's answer to questions about special schools, should be applied to the Jewish free school in Camden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that if the Jewish free school decided to opt out, Camden would go above the 10 per cent. trigger point. Its planning responsibilities would therefore be shared with the funding agency. The London borough of Camden is happy to maintain the Jewish free school but it plays no part in the borough's planning for Camden pupils. I cannot believe that the Secretary of State intended it, but it would be wrong if, by opting out, the Jewish free school had such a pivotal effect on the education of the other children who are resident in Camden, only 54 of whom attend the Jewish free school. For that reason, we want the Committee to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
My second example is the London Oratory school, in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, which has already opted-out. It is the only grant-maintained school in that borough but, having opted out, it could trigger the mechanism as soon as the Bill becomes law. The London Oratory school educates 1,197 pupils, of whom 196 are resident in the borough. Twenty per cent. of the pupils taught in Hammersmith and Fulham attend that school, yet the 196 pupils represent only 3·74 per cent. of pupils resident in the borough. Again, we have a stark example of a school that is already grant-maintained: if the Bill is passed unamended, the trigger would take place immediately in Hammersmith and Fulham without the other parents or the other 5,000 pupils having any say in the fact that the LEA's responsibility would be shared with the funding agency. That cannot be right. Those people who are resident in Hammersmith and Fulham and who decide who represents them, will have no say in the way in which the schools are structured and funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Minister or the Secretary of State intended that outcome because I know that they are constantly telling us that they want to give parents more choice and more say in what is happening. The parents of Hammersmith and Fulham and the parents of Camden will have no say if the Bill is passed unamended because a tiny, tiny percentage—much less than the 10 per cent. trigger that we talked about earlier—of pupils at those schools are resident in the borough and their parents pay for the facilities that the borough provides. It cannot be right or fair that they should be forced into a situation over which they have absolutely no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment because it is worded in such a way as to prevent so few people having so much control over such a wide variety of education within each of our boroughs, whether it is because a large number of pupils like those in Lewisham and other boroughs in south London travel in and out of boroughs to schools, whether it is like the Jewish free school in Camden, which offers a specialised education and which clearly has to take pupils from a wide area, or whether, where we already have a grant-maintained school, the trigger would take place without any say from local parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will support the amendment to make the Bill reflect what the Minister himself has said should be the case, in terms of special schools. On that basis, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be pleased to know that I shall not accuse him of causing chaos and confusion as a result of the clause, but think that there is a certain obfuscation of what we want to do. Therefore, I think that it is important that we study what we want from our local schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old board schools grew out of the community. The community set them up for two purposes: first, to improve the performances of the students that were there, and secondly, to qualify their area to ensure that sufficient people were capable of carrying out the required tasks in a community. Essentially, the residents of the area should have control. The Minister was debating the point with the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey); it is entirely laudable that they do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The residents in the area require education for their children. Their Members of Parliament and local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
councillors are responsible to them and at elections they express their views about the education that they want for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each school within the state system has a different ethos according to where it is located; Yorkshire schools tend to have more in common with Devon and Cornish schools than with London schools because west Yorkshire, apart from Leeds and Bradford, is made up of free-standing towns and villages, as are Devon and Cornwall. Even within those areas the ethos in each school is different, and rightly so. It reflects the pockets of people who have settled in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want neighbourhood schools; they are bad and often difficult to control. I crossed swords with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Sheffield who forced the children of Grimethorpe to move from one school to another because it was nearer, even though the children wanted to stay at the school to which they had been allocated. I found that deplorable. I do not want children to be told to which school they should go. However, it would be wrong if a minority of parents from outside the catchment area were to dictate the policies of the school. It may be the flagship of the area, and if it functions well it lifts people out of the Slough of Despond and makes them look to the stars. It provides ideals and in many cases it provides particular skills for the area. That is especially important for students who do not wish to pursue an academic career. It would be wrong if people from Harrogate were to determine what happens in Featherstone. We must include a qualification in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last school that I taught at was St. Wilfrid's Roman Catholic school in north Featherstone. Featherstone is extremely proud of all that it does: it is part of the community, yet few children from Featherstone are educated there. I can recall the number of local children educated at the school for the last year that I was there because I carried out a survey; it was 21 out of 1,200 pupils. The school's relationship with the urban district council—as it was before the Minister's right hon. Friend disorganised local government—and now with the town council is important. The present governors—even though I have departed—would not wish to change its character, despite the fact that it takes pupils from outside the catchment area of the Wakefield metropolitan district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we leave the clause as it stands, it will be a case of the tail wagging the dog. I am sure that the Secretary of State and the Minister do not intend that. They support parental involvement in an area. That is behind the Government's philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would strengthen that power sufficiently so that it is not only locally rooted but stretches out branches and leaves to birds from foreign climes. If migratory birds were to take over a tree, its nature would be radically changed. Similarly, if we allow parents from outside a district to take over a school, its nature would be altered. That would damage a delicate plant. Democracy and culture are delicate entities, which should be cherished. They are not cherished when outsiders are permitted to control them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, "foreign" parents are separated from resident parents, because the "foreign" parents' LEA must be approached for funding. In some ways, I regret that the relationship between a school and extra-district children is
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
tenuous. Children from north Yorkshire who come into Wakefield metropolitan district are better placed to use Wakefield's services than the support services of north Yorkshire, which would be very expensive. Yet in some circumstances, the parents of north Yorkshire could decide what is to happen in Wakefield metropolitan district. The parents, who come into the heart of Wakefield would consult and influence the authority in Wakefield rather than the north Yorkshire LEA, or some of the splendid Conservative councillors of north Yorkshire. That would be wrong. The amendment would prevent that by including a mechanism in the Bill that would be easy to operate. It would examine the needs of parents in an area. The Minister is aware of the outcry that occurs when children are refused entry to their local school because it is full—it is often full of children from outside the area. The Minister should consider the grass roots, the desire of parents within an area and not that of parents outside the area. The amendment would provide home rule for each school. That would be preferable to the Minister or "foreign" parents imposing a solution. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the sense of the amendment and support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of our criticisms of the Bill, especially clause 7, is that it does away with the good practice that has been built into education since 1944. I shall not rehearse the Second Reading because you, Sir John, and Mr. Martin have made a point about that several times, and did so on at least six occasions during my second speech to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill undermines local democratic accountability, but the amendment would retain the link between the local community and the parents who live in LEA areas. If clause 7 were to be amended in the way that amendment No. 145 proposes, it would state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of an order under subsection (l)(a) above, not less than 10 per cent. of the pupils who are resident in the area and for whom education is provided in county, voluntary and grant-maintained schools in the area are registered pupils at grant-maintained schools".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is sensible and I hope that the Government will accept it. We know that the Government are unwilling to accept any Opposition suggestions, but no doubt, the Minister is listening to this debate to discover if we can convince him of the efficacy of the amendment. I am sure that the amendment's reasonableness will persuade the Minister to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practices of both local government and central Government recognise the need for locally determined provisions in our communities. Local government is elected to represent everyone in a community. The Government recognise that when SSAs are calculated. It is not clear why Wandsworth and Westminster do far better than other local authorities, but, by and large, SSA calculations are based on home-based populations. The total number of people living in Cheshire, my local authority, or within the boundaries of Warrington borough council plays a large part in the calculation of the funding of local government. The funding element for education is drawn up by the Department of the Environment in consultation with the Department for Education and is based on home school populations. Amendment No. 145 would build the concept of the home school population into clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
The argument for the amendment is supported by good education practice. Currently, if parents in my constituency of Warrington, South decided that they wanted their child to cross the boundary and go to school in the metropolitan borough of Trafford, Cheshire county council would have to pay an appropriate sum for each such pupil to Trafford metropolitan borough. The concept of home school populations already exists in education funding and, through section 8 of the Education Act 1944, in the schools that children attend. The LEAs have a duty to provide education in their areas, and must pay, on an individual basis, for every pupil who goes to school outside the boundaries of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for supporting the amendment may be circuitous but I hope that it will convince the Minister. Cheshire and Trafford provide a good example of geographically close LEAs in which there is a good deal of cross-boundary education. A school in my constituency has many pupils whose parents live in the borough of Trafford. Those parents will be given the opportunity to ballot if the school decides to go for grant-maintained status. That will mean that parents from outside Cheshire will have a say in removing a school from the Cheshire LEA. Those parents will interfere in the processes of local government in an adjacent LEA where they cannot vote in local elections. The amendment would ensure that children from outside an LEA who go to a school that has decided to opt out from that LEA would not be included in the 10 per cent. of the school population which is the trigger point for the introduction of the funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Opposition have declared our prejudices about clause 7 already. We are not happy with the effect that it will have on LEAs. However, it would be doubly damaging if parents other than those of the home school population were to be involved in the count that produces the 10 per cent. threshold at which the funding agency for schools is introduced and to which the Minister has accepted no amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A grant-maintained school in an LEA may wish to change its status and become selective. That school may then be attractive to parents outside the area. Its admissions criteria would be based on the scores in an intelligence test. It would not be appropriate for parents and pupils from outside the LEA to take part in the democratic process. If the amendment were accepted, those pupils would not be counted in the 10 per cent. figure required before the funding agency for schools is established in the LEA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pupil count also relates to the exit clause: the point at which the funding agency will take over responsibility for providing sufficient school places in the local authority area. Prejudices exist and have been demonstrated during our discussions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth said, we want a safeguard in the Bill to introduce natural justice into the process. The amendment would provide that because it would require the school count to be based on pupils who live in the LEA area. It is a straightforward safeguard that does no "violence"—a word I have come to understand as it applies to the Government—to the impact of clause 7 or to the intentions of the Bill. It would retain local accountability in the provision of sufficient school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
I hope that the Minister accepts the amendment. That would be a paradox: I do not expect him to accept any amendments. Perhaps he will astonish us all by showing that the Government are listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) did not want to be unfair, but I have accepted several amendments already and I have made it clear that I am willing to do so again if I am persuaded. Opposition Members will have to do a wee bit better than they have up till now, despite the fact that the hon. Member for Hemsworth was in turn arboreal, ornithological, xenophobic and radical. That did not surprise me, radix being in tune with the aforementioned words, but I was still not persuaded by his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problem as Opposition Members have described it, but I suggest that it is looked at in a different way. The number of pupils in schools is the logical connection between ballots for grant-maintained status and the trigger point. That is an important consideration. The hon. Member for Bridgend argued earlier that the calculation should be based on form 7 returns, which counts the pupils in schools. The Bill is consistent with that approach, which was so eloquently advocated by the hon. Member for Warrington, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed earlier that pupils in special schools would not be included in the school population to determine whether the 10 per cent. threshold has been reached because those pupils would probably come from a wider area than the LEA. Opposition Members are merely applying the logic that the Minister wisely used earlier, so he should accept our point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a clever debating point—I would expect no less from the hon. Gentleman—but the parallel is unfair. There is a world of difference between the nature of special schools, the distance that many pupils travel to them, the scatter of pupils and special schools, and the relatively short distances, albeit occasionally across LEA boundaries, that pupils travel to attend ordinary, mainstream schools. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is not valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach in the Bill is consistent with the basis on which balloting takes place in schools. That is consistent with the count done for form 7 every January, which will affect the percentage of pupils. The percentage will swing in different ways in different authorities and circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the problems that the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) mentioned. The mechanism for which the Bill provides will occasionally cause difficulties, but they are not great enough for us to overturn the basis on which we intend to operate, by accepting their suggestion of residency as a primary qualification. The consistent basis that we have selected for balloting—form 7 and so on—is well understood and well established. I understand the Opposition's claim that they are trying to make the provision more workable. However, the approach set out in the Bill is more consistent and workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister admit that where a 10 per cent. trigger point affects only one secondary school, which is able to accept children from a wide area beyond the LEA boundary, most pupils of that school would come

	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
from outside the LEA and it could be that only 5 per cent. of parents in the area vote? Would the Secretary of State take account of those circumstances when deciding whether the trigger mechanism should operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I accept his analysis and I am sure that the circumstances he describes will arise, but we must accommodate that. If we change the basis for the mechanism, there will be a different set of anomalies. The matter boils down to a choice of anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the Bill is phrased deliberately grants the Secretary of State some discretion about the threshold, the way in which it is crossed and the circumstances that surround it. The Bill states that the Secretary of State "may" rather than "will" take action. I cannot go further and say that the Secretary of State would have to take account of the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described when deciding to make the order. He would be guided, but the hon. Gentleman invites me to go a crucial stage further. I am reluctant to do so because the mechanism in the Bill is based on well-understood ground rules, even if it gives rise to the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister an example. The debate is not hypothetical; it applies to schools that have recently attempted to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to Trinity school in the city of Manchester, a non-selective Church of England secondary school. It is a popular establishment because it achieves high standards and because it is not far from the boundary between Manchester and Trafford. Many parents in Trafford, which retains a selective system, prefer to send their children to a non-selective school; they choose Trinity, too, because it a Church school. For those reasons, a large proportion of Trinity's pupils live outside the city of Manchester. Trinity was the first school in Manchester that attempted to opt-out, but the ballot went against the proposal. If it had opted out, it would have taken the whole of the city of Manchester a long way towards the 10 per cent. trigger mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a hypothetical debate; we are discussing real issues, which would apply especially on the Manchester-Trafford boundary because of the different systems of education in the two boroughs. There is cross-boundary traffic to Trinity and to other schools in the area. Two of my children, like other pupils who are Trafford residents, go to another non-selective school in Manchester. It would be unfair if the Manchester schools were undermined by Trafford residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely accept what the hon. Gentleman says. As I told him, I would have to accept what happens in those circumstances. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is right to say that one school would take the whole of Manchester a significant way towards the trigger mechanism. The argument can be turned on its head by saying that if there were residential rules, there would also be anomalies. If I am to be as consistent about the basis for balloting and about the form 7 returns as I wish to be, I must accept the anomalies. I cannot bend and twist every way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he is being consistent; he used the words "well understood ground rules". The Government have used the phrase "parental choice" to support the concept of the Bill. Parents choose to opt out
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
of the control of their LEA. The Minister has accepted that parents from outside the LEA might tip the balance in favour of an application for grant-maintained status. Those parents may cause a funding agency for schools to be set up in an LEA where they do not live. That cannot be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what will happen. Parents who choose to send their children to a particular school, as in the example given by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd), may vote for the school to leave the control of the LEA. Those are the circumstances, whatever the connotations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was churlish of me to complain, as I confessed that two of my children attend schools outside my LEA. However, my other two children attend schools in my LEA and if the Minister abolished selective education in Trafford, I might be prepared to compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is wrong is that the funding agency would be set up to consider school places on the basis of the Manchester population but it would have been brought into existence by people for whom it would not plan. That is what is so illogical about the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede all those problems, but I do not want to get too bogged down in the issue of boundaries, bearing in mind the effect of the Greenwich judgment, for example, and the mobility of parents, which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister admit that our amendment could be extremely helpful to the present Secretary of State for Education, and future ones? He expressed anxiety about their duties in relation to earlier amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East mentioned two examples, the Jewish free school in Camden and the London Oratory school in Hammersmith and Fulham. In those cases, 3·9 per cent. and 3·7 per cent. of the parents, respectively, resided within the LEA boundaries. Does the Minister accept that it is one thing for a school and its parents to opt for maintained status, but it is quite another for the funding agency to become involved in education planning and provision in an LEA area when the decision is taken by such a minuscule proportion of parents in that LEA area? The Minister has conceded half the argument by saying that these matters would be considered. It would be much more effective if he were willing to include them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. I am reluctant to change the basis on which this aspect of the Bill has been structured because of some spectacular but not necessarily representative examples given to the Committee this morning. Anomalies and examples can always be found to suit a purpose, but I am reluctant to overturn the basis of the calculation in the way suggested by Opposition Members. I am especially unwilling to change the form 7 process, which the hon. Member for Bridgend has just defended, to deal with anomalies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfair to say that the Opposition have produced one or two dramatic examples.

	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
grant-maintained schools already represent more than 10 per cent. of pupils. Does he mean that those parents, when the Bill is enacted, will have no say, no control and no representation through their LEA? Will the responsibility be shared immediately with the funding agency? That is the effect of the clause as drafted. Those parents have paid their local taxes and elected their local representatives. They believe that their LEA controls and drives the policy for their local schools. Is the Minister going to tell those parents that their representation in education cannot continue because one grant-maintained school has exceeded the 10 per cent. limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are going back over the same old ground. The parallel regime begins when the 10 per cent. threshold is reached. The schools that remain with the LEA will continue to be handled by the LEA. The grant-maintained sector will be dealt with by the funding agency. The hon. Lady's excitement is unnecessary. The dramatic picture tht she has painted will not come about.

Friend the Member for Lewisham, East referred should be taken more seriously by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would have powers in so far as they balloted to remain with their LEA; its duties under section 8 of the Education Act 1944 would continue in the parallel regime that we have described ad nauseam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for being so generous—he is obviously in a good mood. Again, he said, "their LEA", but in this case it is not their LEA, but the neighbouring one. He should come to terms with that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said as much about the amendment as I decently can. I suggest that the Committee reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has adequately shown us that the Bill is full of confusion and anomalies. We have clauses that not only further reduce parental choices, but reduce democracy. Further chaos looms on the horizon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will reduce local accountability and, most importantly, it will reduce the essential relationship between parents and the local democratic system that runs the school. The Minister is overlooking the fact that, in many communities, parents have built up their schools over many years. They have planned and worked together to develop those schools, by sending their children there. Communities often have great pride in their local schools, whether they are primary or secondary schools or further education colleges. The schools belong to the local community and the parents jealously guard their independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rejected amendment No. 89 which, in its good sense, would have pushed the 10 per cent. threshold forward. We must work on the 10 per cent. figure because that is when the funding authority and the LEA will start to share parallel duties—the Government have taken two weeks to create that construction of words. That is an essential difference in the way in which education is planned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall exercise the Minister's mind a little more with some arithmetic. I gave him some a moment ago—approximately 60 per cent. of parents voted in ballots and approximately 60 per cent. voted in favour. I pointed out that 60 per cent. of 60 per cent. of 10 per cent. is 3·6 per cent. In some LEAs, as many as 20 per cent. of children live outside the area to which they are sent, so we must include 80 per cent. to the previous figure to represent the parents who live in the area and who can vote. There is now 80 per cent. of 60 per cent. of 60 per cent. of 10 per cent., which I calculate as 2·88 per cent., which is the proportion of parents in an area who decide on whether they will share the funding responsibility of the LEA with the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to confuse the Committee with too much arithmetic, so I hope that Members will bear with me. It is conceivable that only 50 per cent. of parents would turn out to a ballot and then only 50 per cent.—or 51 per cent.—would vote for the school to go grant maintained. There could be 80 per cent. of 50 per cent. of 50 per cent. of 10 per cent., which makes 2 per cent. So as little as 2 per cent. of parents in a particular area could decide whether responsibility is shared with the funding agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It took me a number of attempts to obtain O-level maths. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport tell us whether, using his calculations, it could be as little as 1 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend wishes instruction in GCSE mathematics I would be happy to oblige. I have helped many people over the years—successfully, if I may say so. If there were only a 25 per cent. turnout in the ballot, 25 per cent. of 50 per cent. of 80 per cent. of 10 per cent. is 1 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to make a similar analysis of an LEA after an election if the control of the authority depended on the close outcome in one council seat in one small ward? A small number of electors in a small ward in a large authority could determine the control of the authority and all its future policies. What does the hon. Gentleman think of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be making a case for proportional representation. If so, on the basis of the votes cast in the election, only 42 per cent. of the Committee would be Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not so. Ireland boasts—if that is the right word—a particular form of proportional representation. In the recent general election in Ireland, the outcome of one seat could have determined the Government. So the same applies to the much vaunted proportional representation system. I would be interested to know if the hon. Gentleman favours such a system—I suspect that the hon. Member for Bath does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To use the Minister's words, I think that he is getting unnecessarily excited about this matter. We are having an interesting tour around Europe's proportional representation systems. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the question."] I am sure that if we take that matter further, Sir John, you will draw me back into line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an analogy. Whatever his views on the proportional representation system in Ireland, at least all the electors were Irish citizens and lived in Ireland. We are trying to distinguish between those who live inside and outside the LEA area, so his anology is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for highlighting our essential point. In local council elections, people cannot wander around the authority deciding where to cast their votes. Only by a neat construction of the law did we allow people living abroad to vote—they had a disproportionate effect on the result in some constituencies. Only this Government would support such undemocratic principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs work together well. They share responsibility; one authority may pay money for pupils to attend schools in another area. If the amendment were not carried, that scope for co-operation could easily break down, especially if one authority thought that the number of pupils it was receiving from another area would trigger the 10 per cent. mechanism and remove its sole power to run the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point. The Minister said that occasional anomalies should not change the purpose of the Bill, but such existing occasional anomalies could get worse. Our amendment would not change the Bill radically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have used our experience in our constituencies in tabling the amendment, because we can envisage problems. We are trying to convey them to the Minister before he crashes into them when the Bill is enacted. We have ample evidence of Government error: the introduction of the national curriculum; the problems caused by standard assessment tasks. The English cuirriculum and SATs for 14-year-olds are now causing problems, as well as the changes to the GCSE. If the Government had listened to the Opposition, parents and LEAs, they would not have made such grievous errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we should not take dramatic examples, but the ridiculous anomalies that will affect many LEAs will be dramatic when they are aggregated. The Minister said that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East should not get bogged down in such matters, but we should get bogged down in local accountability and democracy. Local democracy is being swept away for the Government's convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
The Government ignore the views of parents. The amendment would re-establish the rights of individual parents to make decisions that are pertinent to their area and it would remove the right of parents from one area to influence matters that affect another area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two brief points to support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is unaware of the difficulties that the wording of the Bill could cause. Last Tuesday, the Committee discussed what would trigger the 10 per cent. mechanism. I asked the Minister whether a school could become grant maintained if the majority of its pupils did not live in the area. The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"yes, where appropriate. I doubt whether the exact circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described would apply."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 343.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister was obviously unaware of the circumstances that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East mentioned earlier. During a lengthier consultation period, such problems could have been discussed and resolved before they were included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will deny parental choice. The Conservative party wishes to continue to promote itself as the party of parental preference, but the clause will work against the interests of parents in many LEA areas. What has happened in Camden, and Hammersmith and Fulham represent clear examples of how few people who live in a local authority area have a say in the involvement of the funding agency in strategic planning for their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information that could implement the amendment is freely available. There are no practical reasons for rejecting the amendment. The Government object to it in principle. The Opposition are worried that the Government put bureaucratic convenience before the views of parents. The Minister says that the examples that my hon. Friend provided are one-offs, or exceptions. There is some strength in that argument; the examples given earlier arose because the Inner London education authority was abolished and new LEAs, with new boundaries, were imposed. Children now move across those artificial boundaries which did not exist under ILEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that if the Bill, when enacted, lasts for 25 or 50 years, as the Secretary of State said, it will be affected by the Government's intention to reorganise the county structure. They want unitary education authorities within the county system. If that happens, the traditional flow of pupils will be impaired by the imposition of artificial boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my hon. Friend refers, rightly, to the specifics of the former ILEA, the problem does not apply only to London. Whatever the arguments about selection, where a selective system is retained, there is cross-boundary traffic in both directions. In north Trafford, the LEA has resisted the idea of a complete secondary system for Roman Catholic pupils. There is a secondary modern school in north Trafford for Roman Catholic pupils, but no grammar school. By definition, therefore, pupils from north Trafford have to travel to school in south Trafford or Manchester. It is not only a London phenomenon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend says. I was trying to stress that such examples are not as stark as those in the old ILEA area. Those of us who represent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
metropolitan areas know that there is a lot of cross-boundary traffic, which we support, as it allows parents greater choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the old ILEA area, new educational boundaries have been imposed on the traditional routes and flows of pupils. That will happen more frequently with the introduction of unitary authorities to the existing shire counties. Many schools will be in a similar situation to that of the London Oratory and the Jewish free school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This reasonable amendment would tackle an existing problem. Whatever the outcome, it will not be perfect because an administrative solution will be imposed whatever the views of parents. The amendment would improve clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in a representative democracy, one qualification for the franchise is residence? The amendment would extend that concept of democracy to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government talk about schools opting out of LEA control. If the amendment is not accepted, parents who live outside an LEA area will take the decision on whether the funding agency will be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Hammersmith and Fulham, the parents who voted for the London Oratory school to opt out of LEA control did not also vote to opt into the warm embrace of the funding agency, as it was not even a twinkle in the Minister's eye at that time. If the amendment is not accepted, a funding agency will be set up in Hammersmith and Fulham, although no one voted on that. For those reasons, I support this very reasonable and practical amendment. Most Opposition Members find it difficult to understand why the Minister cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I was deeply disappointed with the Minister's response. At the beginning of the debate on this amendment, I had hoped that the Minister would take the opportunity to tidy up the Bill in a way that was consistent with his arguments. He said earlier that special schools would not be subject to clause 7 because of the wide geographical area that they cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to see why the Minister cannot accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend has just described as a reasonable and practical amendment, which would affect especially those areas in which a significant number of pupils cross LEA boundaries for their school education. The amendment would discount those pupils who are recruited into one area from another by a grant-maintained school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend and began to think of my own area. Only last week, the eight district councils in my area opted to become unitary authorities which means that they will be LEAs in their own right. I worked out the implications, and discovered that children would have to cross borders to virtually every district authority. Some children in my area of Durham would want to go to Sedgefield, others to Chester-le-Street or Easington, and there would be similar traffic in the opposite direction. It is a recipe for absolute chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may make snide comments, but the matter becomes more chaotic the closer it is examined. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
eight district councils in my area have become unitary authorities, how many district councils in the whole country will choose the same path? There will be hundreds of anomalies such as those that have been described in Lewisham and Camden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend. The problem will not affect London alone, although I used examples from London because of the changes wrought to the educational boundaries by the abolition of ILEA. The examples that I gave are stark and dramatic, but the amendment is not. As my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) has pointed out, the problem will affect the metropolitan areas and the counties, if they are to be reorganised into unitary education authorities. The Minister spoke about occasional anomalies, but they will snowball into showers of anomalies. There will be hundreds of them, just as there were with the poll tax. The Government had to backtrack on that tax when they discovered that there were more than the odd one or two problems with it and that people were excited about its effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the Minister's vocabulary because I am astonished at his laid-back attitude. The Government purport to give choice to people, especially parents. They talk about subsidiarity but remove the choice of parents in LEAs by not accepting the amendment. I am absolutely astonished at the Minister's complacency and at his response to this reasonable and practical amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially disappointed because the Minister said that he recognised the argument. He said that he acknowledged the difficulty and that it would cause problems from time to time. The amendment offers him an opportunity to get rid of those anomalies and difficulties today by accepting the difference that this simple, straightforward proposal would make to the Bill. As one of my hon. Friends has said, the amendment does not change the spirit or philosophy of the Bill. It merely makes the Bill more reasonable and practical by giving back to local parents the right to decide how education in their area should be provided. I fail to understand why the Minister cannot accept it with good grace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport gave a number of pertinent examples. I shall not attempt to copy his arithmetic—I take his word for that—but he showed how 1 per cent. of parents in an area can make the decisions for all schools and pupils in that area. That cannot be right. It is not fair. As my hon. Friend said, people do not go from ward to ward choosing which they wish to vote in so that they can affect the formation of the council. The ward electorate is based on residence. That is the philosophy of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem affects London very directly now. It extends beyond Lewisham, where 20 per cent. of pupils travel across the borough's boundaries to get to school. It affects boroughs such as Islington and Wandsworth, where the number of pupils going out of the borough to school aroused fears that the LEA in each area could not cope. I am disappointed that the Minister did not respond to the two specific examples that I gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with me and with my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend that schools that have already become grant maintained were not able to consider the implications of the introduction of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
funding agency for schools, as that was not part of the deal that they made? Would it not be a solution to the problem if the Minister were to say that, although he could not accept the amendment, he would consent to advise the Secretary of State that a major problem in the Bill has been identified? I hope that the Minister will say that he will consider what has been said in the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: those schools that have opted for grant-maintained status already did not know that this quango, the funding agency for schools, would be set up. One must speculate about whether parents would have decided as they did had they known about the bureaucratic nightmare that will ensue if the Bill is passed unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply disappointed with the Minister's response. Not only is the clause undemocratic, it is in effect taxation without representation. It is an example of political spite, because the Minister does not accept that LEAs should provide education for pupils and parents in their areas. I hope that the Committee will support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
