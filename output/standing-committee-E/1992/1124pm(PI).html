</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning I expressed my wish to see established a democratic Parliament in Wales that would take on the proposed strategic functions of the funding council for Wales. Such a Parliament does not exist, so the purpose of my amendments is to provide some degree of democratic accountability, albeit indirect—I emphasise "some degree" because it would not provide the democratic accountability currently provided by local authorities. Such accountability will give some substance to the appellation "council" for the Welsh version of the English agency; otherwise the term is meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable that the membership of the council should be determined by the Secretary of State for Wales. If that is to be, I am afraid that the selection will reflect the political values of the Conservative party in Wales, which won less than 30 per cent. of the vote in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the Minister is so keen on parent power, he should allow parents to elect the council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point although I would have to redraft the amendment. My amendment would provide for county councillors to be members of the funding council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are abolishing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that raises another interesting point, which I was hoping that someone would bring up. I shall come to it later. However, I trust that councils will exist even after the reorganisation of local government. Whether they are called county councils, district councils
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
or unitary councils, councillors will serve on them and I believe that when their turn comes they should be represented on the funding council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable for the council to be made up of people who reflect the values of the Conservative party in Wales, which these days is regarded with widespread hostility; much stronger hostility than even six months ago and certainly than many years ago. The council appointed by the Secretary of State for Wales will contain many prominent members of the Conservative party, including, no doubt, former Welsh Office Ministers and unsuccessful Conservative candidates—there are many of them in Wales. If we need confirmation of my fears we only have to look at the lists published this week of the members of self-governing national health service trusts. A series of appointments to those bodies can only be explained by the loyalty of certain individuals to the Conservative party. That is an unacceptable way in which to set up a body that will have a profound effect on the organisation of education in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I quoted from the evidence of the Welsh joint education committee. That body also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Joint Committee sees no justification for yet further centralisation of powers and decisonmaking by the Secretary of State for Wales. It views with deep concern for the future health of the democratic process within Wales, the creation of yet further nominated no-elected bodies".</p></blockquote>
The phrase "deep concern" is certainly no exaggeration. On Second Reading, I said that the removal of democratic accountability will lead, inevitably, to greater insensitivity on the part of public servants, who currently must be constantly aware of the options of elected members and who may become increasingly arrogant and heedless of public opinion without elected members breathing down their necks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that eight members of the funding council would be county councillors. An alteration to that figure after the local government reorganisation would have to be discussed, but that difficulty demonstrates how unreasonable it is to introduce the Bill ahead of local government reorganisation. Those councillors would reflect the views of their councils and therefore of their electors. They would provide a channel of direct communication about circumstances and priorities in their areas. They would also provide a link with the local bureaucracies that will spring up once the funding council is established and begins to gain in importance. The amendment also allows for the co-option of members. It recognises that there is a useful role for people with professional qualifications and experience who can be selected according to their expertise in and experience of aspects of educational provision such as special needs, school inspection and finance. The amendment does not change the Bill's conditions for membership, although I can see great merit in the other amendments in this batch which do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is a less than satisfactory way in which to represent democratic opinion, but it is less unsatisfactory than the Bill, which seriously undermines the democratic process. Its far-reaching effects can only be imagined now. The amendment would reduce the damage and make the creation of the funding council less unsatisfactory. I commend it to the Committee, along with
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
the other amendments in this group that are compatible with the structure of the council that I have described in amendments Nos. 39, 42 and 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) said. I wish to draw attention to amendment No. 65, which would ensure that the schools funding council would include members from the categories that it lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendment for several reasons. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North said, in Wales, we are tired of appointees on public bodies who owe too much allegiance to one political cause, which no one supports. We also believe that the long-standing Welsh convention of consensus on appointments to public bodies has been abandoned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that we feel that equally keenly in Yorkshire? Although 80 per cent. of people in my part of Yorkshire vote Labour, 0 per cent. of the members of local health authorities are Labour supporters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not respond to that irrelevant intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dare, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, we are fearful, not simply because another quango is to be set up, but because it is likely to be stuffed with appointees who belong to one party. I shall not list previous well-known examples of such quangos. Some have become public scandals. The Public Accounts Committee and the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs are considering those matters. Yesterday, in Cardiff the Select Committee was told that people who wish to become members of public bodies have to fill in a form. Difficulties arise because the forms are, occasionally, filled in after the appointment has been made. Consensus has been abandoned throughout Wales, from the north to the south. That predicament will become worse as a result of clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North we do not support the establishment of a schools funding council for Wales. However, if it is to exist, its members should represent a cross-section of people, who have served not only the education community but the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh joint education committee is highly distinguished. Its recent 82 per cent. A-level pass rate showed that, in eight subjects, it surpassed many English boards, including the Oxford and Cambridge ones. It has served the people of Wales well in providing advisory and other education services, including Welsh-medium education. The new schools funding council should, by right and by law, include representatives from the WJEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the general election, in this very Room, we debated the establishment of councils for higher and further education in England and Wales. The longstanding convention that such bodies should include representatives of teaching or non-teaching staff, parents, and those who are elected by the people of Wales to serve them on educational matters, was again dismissed by the Government. Until the Welsh Office begins to mend its ways with regard to public bodies in Wales, we will be offered nothing short of a rotten and corrupt system, which gets worse by the month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's assertion that non-departmental public bodies are packed with what the hon. Gentleman called Conservative supporters if not worse. The hon. Gentleman should look at the membership of the Further Education Funding Council and tell me whether they are Conservatives, Labour supporters or members of any other party. Consider Jeff Cocks, principal of Pontypridd technical college, Dr. Ken Thomas, formerly dean of Hatfield polytechnic and member of Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools in south-west England, and Dr. John Walters, Open university, Cardiff. Is the body packed with Conservatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that all 1,000 appointments in Wales were Conservatives. I doubt that 1,000 Conservatives could be found who would fit the bill. When the Minister refers to funding councils and other public bodies in Wales, he should refer to the most important—those that spend millions of pounds of public money. The Minister knows as well as I do that the chairman of the Land Authority for Wales and of the Cardiff Bay development corporation is the former Conservative candidate—God bless him—in Blaenau Gwent and Ebbw Vale. He takes home £67,000 at the same time, but that is another matter. He is obviously a Conservative, placed by a Conservative Secretary of State. The former Member for Cardiff, Central and Minister at the Welsh office has just been appointed chairman of the South Glamorgan health authority. Those positions are of great importance in Wales; millions of pounds are spent by supporters of the Minister's party. I am not saying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to get away with this. Would he call Lord Brooks—former agent to Lord Callaghan when he was a Member of Parliament representing a Cardiff constituency—a Conservative? Lord Brooks is a member of the Cardiff Bay development corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know he is. I suspect that his presence on that body has tempered some of the silly things that it might have done. That is not the point. The point is that the consensus across the board in Wales on getting people from different political parties involved in the governance of Wales has been abandoned. There are rotten examples of obvious placemen and women in positions of great significance in the running of Welsh life. Last week, as the Minister is aware, someone on the South Glamorgan health authority had to resign because of implications about her connections with the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fine if the Conservative party held a majority of support in Wales, although even then there is some doubt about it. However, that is not the case: more than 80 per cent. of people in Wales rejected the Conservatives yet here they are, running health authorities, land authorities, Cardiff Bay, education authorities and so on. They propose yet another agency and unless the Bill specifies what sort of people should be members there will be no safeguard of democratic conditions in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more the Minister tries to defend the appointments to public bodies in Wales, the less notice the people there will take of him. Only when he agrees to a proper
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
consensus and across-the-board appointments to public bodies will the people of Wales accept what he says. The Government are not likely to accept amendment No. 65, but unless change is forthcoming, there will be much trouble in the months ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North seriously asking the Committee to consider reinstating the stranglehold exercised by councillors, as members of those schools local education authority, by appointing those very people to the funding council? Is that a serious proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's language is regrettable. To speak of democratic control as a stranglehold is disgraceful. I do not know whether he has attended meetings of county councils or education authorities and heard the debates that take place and the constant interaction between officials and councillors. The democratic process goes wrong, but to call it a stranglehold is a disgraceful distortion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where has the hon. Gentleman lived for the past 50 years? Some members of the Committee represent constituencies in south Wales whose education authorities are infamous for the manner in which they select teaching staff. I would go as far as to say that those authorities are so notorious for selecting card-carrying members of the Labour party that they have become almost a model for Monklands district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North is concerned about the democratic process, and democratic accountability. We all are, which is why the people who really matter in this context—the parents—will be able to choose whether to let their schools remain part of an LEA or to take grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is so eager for parents to have that choice, is he demanding that more than 50 per cent. of parents vote in favour of opting out rathern than the minority, as at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us consider the way in which housing ballots are arranged. The vote is carried if all who did not vote in that ballot are included with those who voted yes and the result is equivalent to more than 50 per cent. of the potential electorate. It is perfectly simple. In this instance—indeed, it has happened—it is possible for fewer than 50 per cent. of parents to vote, with a majority in favour of 1 per cent. with the result that the school opts out despite the fact that the majority of parents are not in favour of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a seminar, not an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to leave matters as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North that the democratic process is one in which parents would have a say, as opposed to the current system. If the hon. Gentleman genuinely believes that education authorities are doing so well by Welsh schools, will he comment on the fact that Welsh LEAs have underspent on their capital spending for the past three fiscal years and have reallocated funds elsewhere. They do not seem to set the priority that they should for schools in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will still be some LEA schools left with the grant-maintained schools, so there will be choice. In the event of all schools becoming grant maintained, clearly the point has been proven. I find the comments of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak about the LEAs and the fact that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North wants to create one national LEA as opposed to the existing eight. Earlier this morning, we heard that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) is happy that his LEA is prepared to ostracise a GM school and advocate that schools within its area should not even play sports with it. The LEAs try to persuade, cajole and even frighten parents who are interested in exploring the possibility of applying for grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to two amendments—or, more accurately, three because although one amendment is about one subject, it takes two amendments to cover the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 63 and 62 increase the range of the membership of the funding council from eight to 12 people, to 10 to 14 people. Amendment No. 40 sets out qualities and experiences that we think those who become members of the funding council in Wales should have. The slight increase in the size of the membership is necessary to give the Secretary of State more flexibility in appointing people with more specific experience than the general requirement referred to in the Bill. The Secretary of State wants people with educational experience who have
	<br><blockquote><p>"shown capacity in the provision of primary or secondary education or to have held, and to have shown capacity in, any position carrying responsibility for the provision of such education".</p></blockquote>
Among the other interests that should be included, one in particular should be part of the Bill. For a number of reasons, there is a need to include a specific reference to people who have shown a capacity in, and who have recent experience of, special needs education. It is all well and good to speak of the need for people who have mainstream experience of, and expertise in, primary and secondary education, but we also need people with experience of dealing with such children.

My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said that when the Government introduced the
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
Bill which became the Education Reform Act 1988, it was virtually impossible to find a reference to special needs education. As a result of the promptings of my hon. Friend and others on the Committee, the Government realised their mistake and introduced provisions for children with special needs. That Act also introduced the national curriculum and standard assessment tasks. In this Bill, particularly in part III, the Government have at least recognised special needs education and the need to provide it for statemented children. In part III, the Government improve things for children likely to qualify for a statement by speeding up the process, giving parents more choice and having a new, more effective appeals system. We shall discuss that and the improvements that we can make to the Government's regional efforts to take account of the Audit Commission report's revelations, later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are children who will not qualify for a statement but have special education needs. The landmark Warnock report, which was followed by the Education Act 1981, which began to deal with this problem, estimated that while 2 per cent. of children may have such learning difficulties that they need a statement specifying what help they should get, 18 per cent. would need some learning support. Therefore, the fact that people with expertise in special needs education, let alone the others who should be considered for inclusion, will not be members of the funding council in Wales is a glaring omission. The Bill gives no statutory protection to children who may have a learning difficulty but do not have a statement. I would be happy for the Minister of State to contradict me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall use the example of hearing impairment. I make no apology for discussing this issue now and shall probably do so on a further 365 occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey by the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf shows that three LEAs in Wales—the three Glamorgan LEAs, in fact—are pioneers in the provision of services for deaf children. I am not an expert in what is happening in other parts of England and Wales, but I venture to say that those three authorities offer some of the best provision that can be found. They employ 67 teachers with responsibility for helping children with hearing problems. By English standards, the authorities are relatively small, but there are 550 children in their areas whose hearing problems are so severe that they have a statement specifying the help that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the figures for South Glamorgan, but the other two LEAs have a further 408 children who do not have a statement but who require regular help with their hearing problems. That might consist of weekly, fortnightly or monthly visits and help from the hearing impaired service. It is probable that the total for the three counties of children who do not have a statement but who need regular special help would be more than 600. However, the hearing impaired service is non-statutory. That means that the three Glamorgan authorities do not have to provide it, but they offer a special level of help that stops short of requiring a statement for children with hearing problems. It could be argued that many parents would seek statements for those children if the hearing advisory service were not maintained at such a high level, that would ensure statutory help, but the fact remains that there are about 600 children without statements who get a high level of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next figure that I shall give the Committee really took me aback when I first heard it. In those three areas, nearly 10,000 children receive non-statutory help at a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
lower level from the hearing impaired services to enable them to make the most of their education. The three authorities supply a badly needed service that is beyond the call of duty, but they do so under the threat of being capped under the poll tax or, from next year, the council tax rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman proceeds, I wish to reply to his earlier challenge on statutory protection for those with special educational needs but no statement. I draw his attention to clause 144 which imposes a duty on governing bodies to "use their best endeavours" to provide suitable education for children with special educational needs irrespective of whether they are statemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was aware of the provision requiring governors to use special endeavours to provide help for children who do not have statements. I have received representations from a wide range of organisations with an interest in this area. They remain sceptical about whether "best endeavours" is a strong enough statutory duty to provide what those children need. We are considering tabling an amendment to rephrase that provision to require the duty to be as strong as it is for a child who has a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that because of the difficulties that LEAs now have in providing for children with special needs, parents are under pressure to press for a statement, regardless of whether their child needs to be statemented, because they feel that that is the only way in which their child will get the necessary resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I want to deal with next. Local authorities are under heavy pressure to keep their finances under control. One of the ways of doing so is to reduce services that they do not have a statutory duty to provide. That is affecting the provision of education for hearing impaired children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is developing into a debate about special needs provision. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his comments to the membership of the funding council. That is all that is bothering me at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely point out that one of the amendments would require the membership of the funding council to include at least one person, if not more, with experience of special needs education. I am seeking to show the importance of such a provision by explaining what is happening in one sphere of special needs education. I want to take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) about the pressures on local authorities that provide those non-statutory services. The three counties to which I referred provide a service well beyond the call of duty because they provide for 49 children who are not yet at school; they are being helped in preparation for their school careers. Even those three authorities have had to reduce their service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mid Glamorgan, much to their credit and even though it is threatened with capping, has not reduced its service in the past four years. It has kept its 29 teachers and support staff for hearing impaired children. But West Glamorgan has had to cut its service: three teachers have been lost. In South Glamorgan two teachers have been lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
Services are being reduced and LEAs are under financial pressure to cut their non-statutory services so those children's needs are not being met. That leads parents to ask for a statement, which they think will guarantee the necessary support. The school psychological service and the health service then have to decide whether a statement is needed. The cost will be greater. If the funding council includes people who have special needs expertise, it will save the Government money. We hope to strengthen other obligations to children with special needs who do not have statements. I look forward to a sympathetic and positive response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always sympathetic towards proposals for children with special educational needs. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman of the Bill's provisions, which we shall discuss later, for children with special educational needs. Those provisions cover many points made by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the composition of the funding authorities extensively when we considered clause 1. The difference between the provisions for the composition of the funding agency for schools in England and for that of the schools funding council for Wales is in numbers: 10 to 15 for England; eight to 12 for Wales. That reflects the smaller scale of the operation in Wales. Such a difference in size exists in the Further Education Funding Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of the funding agency for schools in England and the schools funding council for Wales will essentially be the same: primarily, the calculation and distribution of grants to grant-maintained schools. We shall look for members with the qualities and attributes that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Schools described when we debated the issue in the context of clause 1. The parameters of the choices of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State are outlined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it would be convenient if we could appoint members with the experience outlined in the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). We shall want to consider carefully the qualities and experience that each member can bring to the work of the council, but it would be wrong to prescribe on the face of the Bill the qualifications listed by the hon. Gentleman and thus restrict the Secretary of State's flexibility in being able to put together a balanced team to ensure that the council undertakes its work as efficiently and effectively as possible. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) stressed that there should be flexibility in the appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the difficulties that the Minister fears if too many specific categories of members are included in the Bill. The Bill provides for children who have statements but makes less certain provision for those who do not. In England and Wales more than 1 million children have special needs. It would not have been asking too much to specify that the funding council for Wales should contain one person with knowledge of special neeeds education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill makes clear, we have children with special needs very much in mind. We have set the necessary parameters for making appointments to the funding agency in England and the funding council for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
Wales. Of course, we shall bear in mind all the special interests involved, but it would be a mistake to start specifying any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I shall make one specification for the funding council for Wales. We shall look to appoint members whose qualities and experience relate to the different educational, economic and social circumstances of Wales. Indeed, we have done that for other funding councils for Wales such as that for further and higher education. Therefore, I give the Committee the assurance that we shall look to appoint to the council members who are able to reflect the distinctive nature of Wales. However, I stress, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State stressed, that we shall not appoint people who are representatives of particular vested interests. I am sure that those appointed will have special experience in particular sectors, such as those mentioned in the debate, but they will not be appointed as representatives of particular interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman feels that it is important that those appointed should have special interests and experience, would it not be sensible to include that in the Bill so that we could be certain that those appointed have such expertise? I take the point about representation and I think that we agree on that. Therefore, I do not understand the reason for the Minister's objection to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very simple. Once one begins on that track, one never ends or, if one does, it is with an enormous body of people on the council. Within the special parameters set out in the Bill, we can obviously take special interests into account when making appointments, but the Committee will have to trust us on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel the need to press the point about children with special needs. If the Minister examines the amendments and the categories that are included in them, he will see that amendment No. 49 relates specifically to the needs of children in the classroom. The others relate to expertise in education matters, but not specifically to what happens to children in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the major difference between the special needs interest and the others that are categorised in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I appreciate the Minister's sympathetic response about taking care of children with special needs, it would be so much better if it were a statutory obligation written into the provision on funding council membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go much of the way with the hon. Gentleman. I have expressed my profound concern about children with special educational needs. However, I beg to differ from the hon. Gentleman in that I do not think that the way in which appointments are made to the funding agency or the funding council for Wales is the proper way to represent the type of expertise required. Let the hon. Gentleman not forget that both the agency and the council have powers to form committees. Possibly it would be in such a forum that they would wish people to give special advice to the sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister's comments about specifying categories of people in the Bill. He said that once one begins specifying
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
categories there is no end to it. It strike me that in Wales there are no children who have shown capacity in industrial, commercial or financial matters, but that there are many children with special needs. Why are industrial, commercial and financial matters specified in the Bill when special needs are not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware from debates so far in this Committee that the Government are deeply concerned with resources for schools and management of schools. Clause 1(3)(b), which applies both to the agency and to Wales, and which mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters or the practice of any profession",</p></blockquote>
of course enables the bodies to contain people with expertise in financial resourcing and management of schools. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it true that those persons may have financial expertise, but not appropriate financial expertise, because such expertise is directed towards specifics and therefore is not necessarily suited to the specific in this case—which happens to be some sort of difficulty in learning? They would not know what materials to buy, even though they knew how to buy them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That again is something to be left to the Secretary of State making the appointment. Surely he will seek people with relevant expertise of the kind specified in the Bill. Indeed, we have been reasonably successful in finding such people for other bodies concerned with education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North would pack the schools funding council for Wales with representatives of the county councils in Wales—in other words, representatives of the local education authorities, from whose grasp the grant-maintained schools have opted out. I cannot believe that he is serious about the proposition. Does the hon. Member think that such appointments would inspire confidence in the grant-maintained schools sector, among parents who have decided against local authority control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is casting aspersions on the role of elected county council representatives. Is the Minister saying that that estimable body, the Welsh joint education committee, has been a failure because, as he put it, it is packed with LEA representatives; or would he be prepared to say that that committee has made, and is continuing to make, a valuable contribution to educational life in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Welsh joint education committee was established by statutory instrument. It has 118 members, 84 of whom are county councillors who appoint 34 others. The WJEC operates through five departments or committees and does valuable work, but it is very diffuse. It is a political consultative body. We have heard that the WJEC supplies information to Opposition members of the Committee. It is a co-ordination agency, an examination board, a provider of initial and in-service training, a promoter of Welsh language education generally and of Welsh language curriculum materials and a development and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
research agency too. Although it is a local authority body, only about 15 per cent. of its financing is paid for by the local authorities; 75 per cent. comes from examination fees and contributions from the Welsh Office. We are entitled to consider some of the activities and to make better arrangements if we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members seem to have difficulty with the democratic dimension of grant-maintained schools and with the schools funding council for Wales. The hon. Member for Bridgend said earlier that the Government had no mandate to introduce this Bill in Wales. I am astonished by what he said as he is sitting in the United Kingdom Parliament. This is not a Welsh assembly and the hon. Gentleman is a Shadow spokesman for education throughout England and Wales. He speaks for Leeds as well as for Bridgend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have that ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman claims to have that ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. These are wider issues than those in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected, Sir John. I wanted to clarify the matter of the democratic dimension. The democratic dimension of the schools funding council is clear: it is a non-departmental public body, not the first by any means. The NDPBs were created in abundance by the previous Labour Government and I shall not go into details of the appointments that they made. The democratic lines of accountability are clear: the funding council is appointed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, who is accountable to this House. The schools funding council will have responsibilities for the grant-maintained sector in Wales. For the benefit of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North, I stress that grant-maintained schools have opted out of local education authority control. I cannot envisage them having any confidence in an over-arching body, as the schools funding council would be if it were packed with local authority representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is such an attractive proposition for parents to be able to opt out of local authority control, why is it a one-off special offer? How will the same right—to choose who should govern the schools—be given to future generations of parents? If democracy and the right of parents to choose is so important, I fail to understand why the whole future of the schools will be decided in one ballot. What proposals will the Government make to ensure that future generations of parents have the same choice—to decide whether to seek grant-maintained status or to stay within the local education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is inviting the Minister to stray out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear your strictures in mind, Sir John. That point was, in fact, made earlier today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited the schools in Wales where parents have decided in favour of grant-maintained status. Decisions taken by parents in those localities are taken on behalf of the community. There is no doubt in my mind that the people of Brynmawr, Cwmcarn and those involved in the Bishop Vaughan school in west Glamorgan are very proud to have gained independent status for their schools. However, we cannot forget the petty and vindictive actions
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
of Gwent county council in respect of Cwmcarn school. That is another argument against putting local authority representatives on the funding council for Wales. I am sure that no school seeking grant-maintained status would have any confidence in a body of local authority representatives whose hostility to the concept allowed it to sink as low as Gwent did when Cwmcarn was seeking grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make the point that the schools funding council will not be a surrogate LEA. There is no question of the council acquiring the bureaucracy and trappings of a local education authority. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have control of its annual budget and its activities will be carefully prescribed in regulations and guidelines. We shall seek to appoint people on the basis of their skills, experience and potential contribution to the work of the council. They will not represent any particular organisation or vested interest. They will, however, represent and safeguard the interests of pupils in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to some of the points made in the debate. We have been concerned with two main issues—the need for democratic accountability and the need for the funding council's members to represent areas of expertise and experience that will be useful to it in carrying out its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what has been said, my fear remains—and has even been strengthened by the tone of remarks from Conservative Members—that the need for democratic accountability and for the membership to represent the important areas of expertise are unlikely to be satisfied if the Secretary of State is entirely responsible for appointing the council members. Bitter experience shows that selection of members for Government quangos takes place on the basis of considerations other than suitability for appointment. I could give examples of recent appointments that illustrate that. The consideration that often directs decisions is what the Government regard as the right political ideology—"right" is the right word in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the amendments would place some limitation on the discretion of the Secretary of State. My amendment would place a total limitation by removing from him the power of appointment. All the amendments are in the same spirit of preventing the Secretary of State from having too much discretion, on the basis that such discretion has often been abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention some points raised by the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards). We observed with interest his obvious intense hostility towards local government. His use of words such as "stranglehold" suggests that he wishes local democracy to be smashed. It is reasonable for me to use such language now in response to his emotive language. If he believes that local government has exerted a stranglehold on the education service, I take it that he would have the same opinion of the powers of local government in other areas and that he would also want to smash democratic control of that activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they do not vote Tory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We are afraid that because democracy does not work in Wales for the purpose of the Tory Government, democracy itself has to be removed. I am serious about that, not merely making a rhetorical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
Such hostility was evident in the remarks of the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West on councillor membership to the funding council for Wales. I believe that the people whom county councils would appoint to the funding council would be responsible, experienced and full of ability. There are many able people on our county councils. I should be prepared to listen to proposals to encourage more able people to take up local government membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has yet again challenged the manner in which people are appointed to non-departmental bodies. Is he satisfied with the manner in which people were appointed to the Welsh Language Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to discuss now whether each member of that board is a suitable appointment. There are people involved in Welsh language activity who could be useful members of that board. However, I have in mind the appointment in the past few days of the new chairman of the Ceredigion NHS trust. He is a well-known Tory who has little qualification for the post to which he has been appointed. Other examples could be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West made great play of parental choice, which I am in favour of strengthening. It is important that parents have greater influence on school activities and that they have greater access to schools. I was a teacher for 32 years and saw great progress in that regard. When I started teaching there were no parent-teacher meetings and there were no parent governors. Schools are now infinitely more open. There is no need to go to the lengths proposed in the White Paper to enhance parental choice or influence; there are other ways in which to do that. Local management of schools has strengthened the powers of discretion of governing bodies, which now include parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman suggested that parental choice is the one-off decision as to whether a school becomes grant-maintained was a substitute for democratic control of the strategic function of local authorities, which is to pass to the schools funding council. The division of power between the local education authority and the governors is a matter for debate, with room for manoeuvre on both sides. The key question is whether there should be accountability in relation to the great powers associated with the strategic function of funding that are to be given to the funding council. Clause 72 describes the extensive powers that the funding council will have in connection with special purpose grants. They include the power to give special grants for educational purposes of any description, and to make any provision, educational or otherwise,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which appears to the funding authority to be required for meeting any special needs of the population of the area served by the schools in question".</p></blockquote>
Those extensive powers, which until now resided with the local authority, are to be passed to the schools funding council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding council will also have the power to close schools, to change the nature of existing schools or to open new schools. Only the Secretary of State for Wales will have greater powers. Only he will be able to bypass his own quango and propose the closure of schools if he is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
satisfied that the schools funding council intends to do so. Given that such enormous strategic powers are to be vested in the schools funding council, it is essential that it should be democratically accountable to some degree and that there should be some means to limit the Secretary of State's discretion as to its membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we vote on the amendment—and I assure the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North that Labour Members will support him in a Division—I wish to pick up a couple of points made by the Minister of State. First, he was singularly ungenerous towards the local authority in Gwent. It is the only county in Wales that has survived in its present form since the 16th century. It has done a tremendous job in educating young men and women from our valleys, from Newport and from the rural parts of what was Monmouthshire. The right hon. Gentleman does himself no service by running down the work of the Gwent authority in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments reveal the Government's principles on local government. While there is choice between non-elected and elected bodies making decisions in Wales and because the Government cannot win Parliamentary or local government seats, their answer is to abolish local government. If they do not abolish it, they will take away its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked of the Labour Government, in their day, appointing socialists to various bodies in Wales—of course that happened. The Opposition are not upholding that all appointees should be of one party. We do not think that such enormous power should lie in the hands of any Secretary of State, whether he be a Conservative or Labour one. The big difference between then and now is that the Labour Government were not running down local government at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a democratic deficit in Wales now: most of the important decision making is to be done by the public bodies. The higher education funding council is as similar to that which the Minister proposes. The chairman—Sir Idris Pearce—is a well-known Conservative and stood as a Conservative candidate some years ago. Another member, Dr. Ann Robinson, is a well-known Conservative candidate for the European Parliament. She has tried to gain south-east Wales for the Conservatives—a bit difficult, but she did her best. Mr. Michael Griffith is another member and, I am told, a supporter of the Conservative party. I am not saying that some of those people should not be members of that council, but I think that it should reflect a balance of views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the Minister's remarks have suggested that there should be consensus on the establishment of the councils and their membership. We do not trust the Government over the membership of the schools funding council for Wales on the basis of experience. We believe that we must press this matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, may I draw to the attention of hon. Members the fact that in my provisional selection of amendments, amendments Nos. 68 and 78 have been transposed, and will be called in reverse order. I have additionally selected amendment No. 71 which was tabled by the hon. Member for Bath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 1</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>THE FUNDING AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 146, line 33, leave out 'such salaries or fees' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'a salary equivalent to a qualified teachers' salary grade'.</p></blockquote>
Many members of the Committee, and many people outside the House, are unhappy that the Bill gives considerable additional powers to the Secretary of State for Education. These are over and above the hundreds of additional powers that he gained from the Education Act 1988 and subsequent education Acts. The amendment would limit one of the proposed new powers relating to the determination of salaries or fees of members of funding authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Opposition Members are unhappy about new quangos being established. We are equally unhappy that the Government have refused to consider our reasonable amendment relating to membership of those quangos. We should be even more unhappy if excessively large salaries or fees were given to quango members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quangos establish an additional layer of bureaucracy which will often duplicate the work of LEAs. Many of us are anxious about the cost of this additional, unnecessary bureaucratic layer. It will cost money that should go to already underfunded schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
On the basis of the Secretary of State's speech on Second Reading, I might be forgiven for thinking that the right hon. Gentleman would have us believe that all the money received from saving by the removal of surplus places would go to the remaining schools. That is not the case, as can be seen from the "Financial effects of the Bill" which, on page xvi states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The extent of the funding authorities' responsibilities, and hence their running costs, will depend directly on the number of grant-maintained schools. It is expected that the costs of the funding authorities will be offset over time by savings in the running costs of the Department for Education and the Welsh Office and the central administration costs of Local Education Authorities, as well as savings from the removal of surplus places at their instigation."</p></blockquote>
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from that that the Government anticipate that some of the savings achieved from the removal of surplus places will be needed to pay for the additional tier of bureaucracy. Given that it is the wish of Labour Members to ensure that we minimise the cost of that additional and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, I propose the amendment, which will limit at least part of that potential bureaucratic expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other quangos established by the Government, such as the national health service trusts, non-executive directors receive salaries or fees of £5,000 per annum. In return for that, they are required, once the trust is up and running, to attend very few meetings each year. Ministers may point to what is happening with similar bodies in education and argue that the payments on them are not excessive. I understand that members of the Higher Education Funding Council and the Further Education Funding Council receive an honorarium of about £4,000 per annum. In the case of the FEFC, a member is required to attend approximately 10 to 12 meetings a year. Those meetings may last a day or only part of a day. Even allowing for the additional duties that will be required by members of the FEFC, they will receive the equivalent of £200 or £250 per person per day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast that unfavourably with the remuneration that councillors serving on our local education authorities receive. For the foreseeable future, those councillors will have responsibilities well in excess of those likely to be borne by members of the funding authorities. A level of remuneration similar to that of FEFC and HEFC members would more than allow for the level of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that light, it may seem that my amendment is especially generous. At present, the standard scale for teachers ranges from £11,184 to £18,837 a year. Taken pro rata, given the part-time work that members of the funding authority will carry out, my amendment provides considerable scope for the level of remuneration. It is not excessive and neither so low as to deter people from joining the funding authorities. However, the amendment would constrain the Secretary of State in such a way that very high levels of remuneration—which would take money away from schools that so desperately need as much as possible—would not be paid to members of the funding authorities. Therefore, I hope that the amendment will receive support from both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the intentions of the amendment tabled by the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
those intentions. I fear that if he interprets the amendment strictly according to its wording he will simply argue that it would not be wise to pay as much as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a salary equivalent to a qualified teachers' salary grade".</p></blockquote>
The essence of the hon. Member's proposal is to achieve reasonable, but not unreasonably high, remuneration for members of a funding authority. Even a scale 1 teacher's salary would be higher than amounts paid to any current member, other than the chairman, of the further and higher education funding councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that the scale itself provides the full-time rate. I clearly stated that the calculation would be based on the pro rata part-time rate, just as those scales are used to determine salaries of other people, such as supply teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is essentially our point. It would be unsatisfactory for the Minister simply to give a legalistic response. If he spent his time at breakfast this morning constructing such a defence, I hope that he will tear it up and argue on the merits of the case made by the hon. Member for Bath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a reasonable man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the Minister is usually a reasonable man and, plainly, we look for one of his more reasonable responses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath was right to point out, and we know this from the previous debate relating to Wales, that such public bodies are packed with Tory placemen and women. We do not want tempting financial carrots to be dangled simply to buy the future services of those whom the Tory party wishes to ensnare in its political nets. Therefore, we need the Minister to explain fully the Secretary of State's current thoughts on funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule, if it remains unamended, would give considerable licence to the Secretary of State. He may choose whom he wishes to appoint to the authority and may determine their rates of pay. The public must be confident that people are appointed to the authority because of their relative expertise and that any remineration is simply sufficient to attract people of the required quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise with the Minister a specific point about the salaries that will be paid under the Bill's provisions. I refer the Minister to the European Community directive which touches on the transfer of collective agreements. The Minister was formerly a Member of the European Parliament and was probably there in the late 1970s and early 1980s when that directive went through. Perhaps I may help the Minister by specifying what it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the consequences of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 was a court case that involved the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education when some lecturers' employment was transferred to the responsibility of a new employer. The court held that under the Act, the new employer was responsible for maintaining the terms and conditions of the lecturers. A transfer to a different employer could not be used, as it has been in privatised companies, as a way of depressing salaries or other employment costs. Anxiety exists that one of the impacts of the opting-out system will be to weaken teachers' contracts of employment in opted-out schools. That was deemed to be illegal in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
case of further education. Would the Minister deem it to be illegal if an opted out school altered the terms and conditions of teachers? The Minister should place the Government's view on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are pushing your luck: that is not in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to cover that point, because it will affect many people. Salaries are of interest not only to the funding authorities but to those whose salaries may come within their ambit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Salaries are a live issue. I am told that some Departments are panicking. I am trying to detect whether the Minister shows signs of panic or even knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is more used to loins than panic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath made an important point. The Opposition expect remuneration for members of the funding authorities to be in line with what is necessary to attract competent and talented people. The Minister should comment on that. It might be helpful to compare remuneration for members of the schools funding authorities with that for the equivalent body for further education. Have any levels of remuneration been established? What sort of people does the Minister hope to attract by the proposed salary? What sort of attendance burden will be placed upon members of the funding authorities? The number of meetings will determine the remuneration that is necessary to attract people to the funding authorities. We support the principle of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with those who have said that they believe the Minister to be a reasonable man and, therefore, expect him to accept the rationale of the amendment. I have heard so many compliments paid to the Minister that I am beginning to believe that he will be sanctified one day, perhaps as "St. Eric, or Little by Little". However, I wish to help the Minister. The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out 'such salaries or fees' and insert</p></blockquote>
'a salary equivalent to a qualified teachers' salary grade'." For the sake of the Minister's Welsh colleague, perhaps I should put that into simple language. The hon. Gentleman wants the money that members of the authority get to be roughly the same as is paid to teachers who have gone through university and qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not entirely agree with that. The Minister might, instead of considering a teacher's grade, consider a county councillor's. He might consider the type of fees paid to those who are on local authorities directing education, who are to be replaced by this body. He might consider what the chairman or chairwoman of an education authority is paid and allocate that to whoever is to be chairman or president—or whatever term is used—of the new bodies. The people who work part time might equally receive exactly the same as county or district councillors who work on education bodies. I make that as a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill states that fees will be forthcoming, we can already see the light in some people's eyes. Indeed, I saw the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) tripping and skipping down the corridor today singing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
"Falling in Love Again" with the light, perhaps of a chairmanship, in his eyes. It was a joy to behold. But I do not think that he should have that sort of reward held out to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be reasonable to set the fees at exactly the same level as those of a county or district councillor serving on an education committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can recall a contribution from the hon. Member for Hemsworth some time ago when he referred to his experience and length of service on local authorities. I know that he served on them some years ago in the days when the only remuneration—I do not use the word in its correct sense, but he will understand—that a councillor received was expenses. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the quality of a councillor then was at least as good as that of councillor now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was a councillor the quality was clearly very high indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased that the hon. Gentleman appreciated my singing earlier and that he could at least identify the song, which is, I suspect, more than we on the Conservative Benches could do if he were the soloist. But could he, for my benefit, say how long ago it was that he was a member of a local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Singing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily—dancing would have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am not straying, Sir John, from the topic, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that my last local authority service was in 1978. In 1979 I departed to oppose the Minister in the European Parliament. It has been my lifelong aim to oppose him, because that is the way to get somewhere near what is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who work on local education authorities now receive very little remuneration. People joining the new bodies should do so not because of a lust for money, but because of devotion to public service. That is very important. It would not be very good to give them the pay of a teacher. Teachers' pay is not good and it will be worse now that the Government have frozen it. I appreciate why my hon. Friend tabled the amendment relating to a qualified teacher's salary grade. It would continually bring to the notice of the people who rule them how poorly teachers are paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of the many misguided remarks made without knowledge of what teachers do, that takes the biscuit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will think about the apparent complete lack of knowledge of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We must take into account the number of things that teachers do out of work hours, when considering teachers' wages and
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
the commensurate amount the funding agency will receive. They meet parents, raise money for text books, handle SATs and make sure that the Government have not, overnight, changed the national curriculum—which they do with regularity, especially for English. They also have to reorganise syllabuses because of Government mistakes in the national curriculum and spend their summer holiday making sure that pupils get of the best. That is a hard job for which teachers are underremunerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the son and father of teachers, I agree with that. I also agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about the value of the work. I cannot understand why he supports the amendment when the hon. Member for Bath said that the job may be part time. In that case, to which teaching grade would the hon. Gentleman attach such pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clearly stated. If the pay were based on a teacher's salary, I would use that of one starting in the profession. However, it should be based on the pay scale of a county or a district councillor; then people would do the job simply for the love of it. I fear that the funding agency will be a remote body making occasional comment and concentrating its main work elsewhere. It will, quite properly, make money in industry, finance and the banks—wherever the Secretary of State chooses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman properly referred to remuneration for teachers. I also believe that teachers deserve reasonable remuneration and therefore approve of the substantial pay increases that they have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 23 October, I questioned my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on this and he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We estimate that average teachers' pay at 1 April 1992 was £20,630. This represents an increase of 273 per cent. in cash terms since 1979 or a real terms increase over that period of 46 per cent."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 October 1992; Vol. 212, column 	<i>448.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I believe that that substantial pay increase is entirely deserved. I also believe, as the hon. Gentleman does, that the overwhelming majority of the nation's teachers are dedicated to the children in their charge and to their profession. Teachers have received a considerable increase in pay, which I hope he will welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing to my attention the increase in teachers' salaries in that time. The average age of teachers has risen considerably and we must take that important factor into account.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman cares to translate it into Latin or Greek he will discover that it remains neuter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Minister gives a more or less precise account—I do not ask for the exact penny or ha'penny—of how much he intends to give to the people who work on the body, including those in charge. Will it be more or less in line with that paid to county councillors, to teachers or to the chairmen of water authorities? I think we should be told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few probing comments on the theme explored by my hon. Friend in relation to what

	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
may happen in Wales when the funding council is established. Thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, I have some figures relating to remuneration for the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and for the Further Education Funding Council for Wales. Both are relevant to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two important differences between the HEFC and the FEFC and the schools funding council for Wales. One is that those involved in higher and further education in Wales did not, unlike the parents of school pupils in Wales, have the chance to vote on whether they wanted to become incorporated, independent bodies.

The chairman of the HEFC has a remuneration of £10,500; members of the board receive £2,000 apiece. The chairman of the FEFC receives £18,500 and board members £2,000 each. It is highly likely that, if the schools funding council is created by order soon after the Bill is enacted, there will be fewer grant-maintained schools in Wales than there are colleges of the university of Wales and of the new university of Glamorgan. Even if we waited a further year, I am confident that there would be fewer grant-maintained schools in Wales than there are colleges funded by the FEFC. I would therefore be interested to know what level of remuneration is being considered for members of the schools funding council in Wales. We should also like to know what will happen in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Therefore, we lose the fees option if we accept the amendment. I shall return to that in a moment, but I advise the Committee that we should not lose the option of payment on a fees basis for the purposes of this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to give the hon. Gentleman that answer in a moment, when I get some assistance, as I cannot tell him off the top of my head.

It is all very well for Opposition Members to say what they would have liked the amendment to say, or what it could or might have said—the hon. Member for Bath, who tabled the amendment, even said that he might have meant something else. I have to deal with the amendment as it is written. When it uses the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"a salary equivalent to a qualified teacher's salary grade",</p></blockquote>
we are in difficulty. The relevant salary grades go from £11,184 to £18,837. In addition, two-thirds of teachers receive an incentive allowance, so that the scale for qualified teaches goes from £11,184 per annum to £29,754 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
What are we to make of that? The amendment states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a salary equivalent to a qualified teacher's salary grade"</p></blockquote>
will be payable. That payment will not be on a pro rata basis, nor will it take account of part-time work. So are we talking about £11,000 or nearly £30,000? We do not know. That is not a satisfactory way in which to proceed. However, in a sense all that is by the by. There are a number of reasons why these positions will not be salaried. First, the body will not emerge for a year. We do not know in detail how many schools it will cover. We anticipate that it will cover well over 500 schools, but the figure may be 1,000 or even 1,500. However, we think that the agency may be set up with part-time members, but we cannot answer the reasonable question of Opposition Members as to what that part-time involvement will be. It could be one a day or week, or more. For that reason, we envisage that the agency's members will receive remuneration on a fee basis. The difficulty is that the amendment precludes the payment of fees, so it would not be a satisfactory way in which to proceed if we wish to retain that option. In the interests of open Government I remind the Committee that the recommended daily fees—the Treasury rates as of September 1992—for members of bodies such as the funding agency for schools is £153 per day plus travel and subsistence. I have lost touch with what Members of the European Parliament get, but the two Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I left before you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman left at the same time as I did. The hon. Member for Bridgend went on to serve with great distinction for a further term in the European Parliament, enjoying all the benefits and emoluments that went with it. I do not think that it would be fruitful. I shall not go down the route of making odious or invidious comparisons with the fee scale that I mentioned with those of either the European Parliament or county councils because the funding agency for schools is an entirely different body that will do a completely different job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the type of people who will be members. Given that we wish to attract people of the type mentioned in the Bill, from experience I think that that fee scale would be more than adequate and about right to attract the sort of people whom we want. We shall not attempt to relate it to some salary scale unquantified, as the amendment proposes. We do not want to preclude or exclude the possibility of a fee basis for payment; we want to proceed on the basis that I have suggested. I have just been told that the five research councils, the Further Education Funding Council and the Higher Education Funding Council are paid on a fee or honorarium basis, so there is an equivalent or parallel to which we could look for guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motivation behind the amendment was entirely misplaced. There is no risk or danger of the Secretary of State wanting to pay vast salaries to lure people into becoming members of the agency. My right hon. Friend will wish to attract people who have a desire to do this work and who will be highly motivated and he will be able to offer them the scale of fees that I mentioned as reasonable reward or compensation. That seems entirely straightforward and at one with past practice for such bodies. We have been able to attract the right people and it will be possible to continue on that basis.

	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
The amendment is unnecessary for those reasons, not merely because it is defective. It would not operate as the hon. Gentleman intended. His fear that vast salaries will be paid to members of the agency is completely unfounded. The agency will operate on the basis that I outlined, which, on reflection, members of the Committee will consider reasonable. That is why I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I respond to the Minister's remarks, may I comment on the contribution from the hon.

I understood him to say that teachers' salaries have been frozen. I believe that to be incorrect. My understanding is that teachers have been advised that their salaries will not increase beyond 1·5 per cent. If we assume that Government estimates of inflation are well in excess of 1·5 per cent., instead of salaries being frozen, teachers will suffer a cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to place on record the fact that teachers' salaries, rather than increasing or being frozen, are likely to suffer a cut in real terms as a result of Government policy. I am genuinely grateful for some of the Minister's comments. He has helped members of the Committee to have a better understanding of how the Government intend members of the funding authorities to be remunerated. He has also given us a small glimpse of their likely period of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not attempt to defend the Minister's legalistic points. We have gained some valuable information. Many hon. Members will want to digest that information and we may return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 147, leave out lines 23 to 31 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'8—(1) the funding authorities shall establish committees to operate in the regions of England and Wales, and any other committees deemed necessary.
	<ol>
	<li>Such committees may include persons who are not members of the authority, and if the committee is to operate in a specified region shall include persons with experience of educational provision in that Region and other members who could be regarded as representative of that region.</li>
	<li>The number of the members of a committee established under this paragraph, and the terms of which they are to hold and vacate office, shall be fixed by the authority.</li>
	<li>Each committee established under this paragraph shall publish an annual report.</li>
	<li>The authority shall keep under review the structure of the committees established by them under this paragraph and the scope of each such committee's activities.'</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 32, in page 147, line 23, after 'authority', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall establish not less than seven regional committees and'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is less controversial, so I hope that it will not entail legal complications. While not limiting the number of additional committees that the authorities may establish, the amendment would ensure that they include committees to operate in the regions of England and Wales. It would also ensure that membership of such committees includes persons with experience of educational provision in the region and persons who could be regarded as representative of the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee and many people outside have expressed considerable concern about the centralisation of education provision implied by the Bill. The proposal to establish a single, remote, undemocratic bureaucracy for England and for Wales has, as we have already heard, brought forth criticism from many individuals and organisations. The Association of County Councils and the London Boroughs Association, which are generally sympathetic to the Government, are not at one with the Government on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will note, Sir John, that I have not referred to the comments of the Conservative Education Association, so as to avoid Conservative Members jumping up to say that in that context "Conservate" does not mean Conservative and that they can use the word whenever it suits them. However, hon. Members may be interested to hear the views of Mr. Martin Easteal, who has been appointed to oversee the Government's local council reorganisation programme. He is the chief executive of the Local Government Commission. Less than a fortnight ago he described the funding authority for schools as "a second best solution" that is likely to lead to centralisation of the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Easteal is reported in the 13 November issue of 	<i>Education</i> as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have set up quangos of this kind before and I can't think that it is any better than a second best solution. One observes that these bodies become centralising influences over a period of time."</p></blockquote>
Like Mr. Martin Easteal and the many others who have criticised the Bill, I fail to see how a remote bureaucracy can be sensitive to the needs of the different regions and localities that make up England and Wales. How can such bodies easily take account of local circumstances and the views of local communities? How can a single, central office of each of the funding authorities have the detailed local knowledge necessary to exercise the functions given to them by the Secretary of State? How can such a remote body develop an ongoing relationship with the individual communities that it is intended to serve?

The amendment, through the proposed regional committees and by means of representation, would partly redress those anxieties. Even so, it will be second best to the preferred option of leaving responsibility with the democratic and locally accountable LEAs, albeit with increased delegation of power and responsibility to individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will be no surprise to Conservative Members. The Government suggested an almost identical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
proposal for another new quango, the FEFC for England. Schedule 1, paragraph 9, page 72 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be established for each region of England determined by the Secretry of State a committee of the Further Education Funding Council for England to advise the council".</p></blockquote>
I accept that there is a difference between this and the previous amendment. This amendment does not prescribe the purpose of the proposed regional committees. That is clearly covered in paragraph (9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the FEFC, the role of the committees is merely advisory. I would like the regional committees, which I hope will be established for the funding authorities, to exercise far greater influence than merely providing advice to the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, to ensure all-party support for the amendment, I have not prescribed the function of the regional committees. I have left the decision about what those functions will be as it is in paragraph (9) of the schedule—to the funding authority or to those who have been delegated authority by members of the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government accept regional committees for the FEFC for England, I genuinely fail to understand why they appear to be unwilling to do so for the funding authorities. I hope that the Minister will say that that is not the case. The FEFC exercises a remit over a smaller number of educational establishments than the number for which the funding authorities will be responsible, assuming that the Government's desire is that all 24,000 schools will be in the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the note released after this year's annual statement, the FEFC will next year have responsibility for a budget of £2·5 billion. Let us take the 1991–92 schools budget figure and, for the sake of argument, increase it by 5 per cent.—as a comparable figure is not available—over the two years from 1991–92. The comparable figure for the schools sector would be £14£2 billion instead of £2·5 billion for the FEFC sector. The FEFC, with its regional committees, deal with fewer institutions and considerably less money. Yet the Government seem to be unwilling to accept the vital importance of regional committees for bodies that deal with far more institutions and a budget that is nearly six times larger. I fail to comprehend why regional committees are considered appropriate for the Further Education Funding Council, but not for the funding authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like people outside the Committee, I am concerned about the remote nature of the proposed funding authorities. We believe that it will be impossible for a remote, undemocratic, unelected body adequately to serve the needs of what the Government hope will be a growing body of grant-maintained schools. We should be looking for ways to improve the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no reference to regions in the original.
