	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Grant regulations in respect of maintenance grants—
	<ol>
	<li>shall include provision for taking into account, in the case of each school required to be covered by the grant regulations in any financial year, the numbers and ages of registered pupils at that school on such date or dates as may be determined by or under the grant regulations in relation to that year;</li>
	<li>may include provision for taking into account any other factors affecting the needs of individual schools which are subject to variation from school to school (including, in particular, the number of registered pupils at a school who have special educational needs and the nature of the special educational provision required to be made for them); and</li>

</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 538, in clause 72, page 43, line 16, after 'grant', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that expenditure is for a similar purpose, and at the same level, as expenditure in local education authority maintained schools which is supported by grant from central government.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 540, in clause 73, page 43, line 27, after 'bodies', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the aggregate sum disbursed by the funding authority to grant maintained schools within any local education authority area in any financial year as a proportion of total capital expenditure approved for all the maintained schools within that local education authority's area does not exceed the proportion of grant maintained schools as a proportion of all maintained schools within the same local education authority area.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 71 and 72 deal with the type of grants available to grant-maintained schools. The purpose of the amendments is to find out how the system of maintenance and special purpose grants will work in schools. The Government are obviously not aware of the great controversy that has surrounded the funding of grant-maintained schools, especially the question whether their additional costs are a true reflection of the costs that the local authority would normally bear for the schools in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
The evidence suggests that if a large number of secondary schools had already opted out and the rest were to follow in fairly quick succession, local authorities—such as Hillingdon and Havering—could find that the money allocated to them for education purposes through the standard spending assessment was insufficient to cover the funding for grant-maintained schools and for the schools that remained under LEA control. The Bill should provide that the funding for grant-maintained schools fairly reflects that for LEA schools and that any additional money GM schools receive truly reflects the costs that the LEA would normally have borne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled amendment No. 566 to probe the Government on special educational needs. The Government's consultation document on the common funding formula examines the problems and suggests ways in which they might be overcome. There is still a strong feeling, however, that the schools that have already become grant maintained will not lose out in the future, because of the way in which they were initially funded. They were given a clear, short-term bribe of additional expenditure considerably in excess of what they needed to cover the local authority costs. The few schools that became grant maintained in the initial wave will be funded in a more favourable way than schools that became grant maintained later and schools in the local authority sector. From memory, I believe that a first wave school—perhaps a London borough comprehensive—will spend £100,000 more than a similar school in the second wave. There will be similar advantage to a school in the third wave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always said that the grant-maintained system depended on bribes that were excessive and that would have to be tapered off as more schools became grant maintained. If there is to be parity and justice in funding schools, whether they are grant maintained or not, there should be no financial benefit—additional funds given to a grant-maintained school should reflect what that school cost the local authority, which would no longer be responsible for it. We hope to explore that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to discuss special educational needs. The funding issue ought to be clear in one respect: we want existing best practice to be enshrined in legislation if a child has a statement that is written precisely and is made under the terms of later clauses. There would then be an almost automatic financial implication to supply what the statement provides for. If a statement applies to a child with special educational needs, it ought not to matter whether the child is in a grant-maintained or a local authority-maintained school—funding would be automatically available. Provision may be made under the common funding formula for payment to be made automatically from a special, set-aside fund. I would not be happy with a provision based on averages, with a school receiving an amount of money because it has had a historic role. A specific and clearly identified amount ought to be made available for children with statements, if only because the parents of such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
children and those involved in their education would want to be sure that that provision was being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wider issue of children who may not have a statement is more difficult to tackle. Many children with severe problems do not have statements. In a comprehensive school, perhaps 18 per cent. of pupils will require additional educational support which will not be covered by a simple capitation allowance. I hope that the Minister will tell us in detail how the formula will allow for that, as much thought must be given to the funding of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems on both sides of the fence. It could be argued that schools may be keen to establish a special educational need, which may require a statement, in order to get the extra funding and the use of that money in the school may become blurred. Children may be excluded because of problems caused by their behaviour. Additional support may be needed to prevent their exclusion, so that they may continue their education in a mainstream environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in many organisations working on special educational needs are worried by those matters. There is special anxiety that children without statements may be squeezed in grant-maintained schools that want their national curriculum test results to show them in the best light. Already, there is some evidence of an increase in exclusions in some schools. It is not a general problem, but it might become so if schools feel that they must show the best results in published league tables. They may come under pressure to drop pupils who are a little awkward and whose learning problems mean that they do not adapt quickly in normal lessons. Alternatively, schools may seek additional funding for smaller classes for such pupils. If 18 per cent. of a school's population must be taught in smaller classes, the sums of money involved across the country as a whole could be considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Education Act 1944 and the Education Reform Act 1988, local education authorities and schools—whether maintained or grant maintained—are obliged to provide in the best way that they can for all pupils so that all of them have equal acess to the national curriculum. For that to happen for some children, we would need smaller classes than can be found in most comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One problem that may arise for children who do not have statements but who are among the 18 per cent. with special needs is that opted-out schools may face budgetary pressures that will cause them to press the LEA to statement those children. The opted-out schools may ask why they should pay from their budgets if they can force the LEA to pay because it has to maintain the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The knock-on effect is that statements will become more vague. There are already some examples in my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
constituency in which the LEA would not specify the amount of non-teaching support that a child required. A child may require 10 or 15 hours of such support, but that is not specified in the statement; it refers only to access to support. The results of the increased pressure on LEAs through the statementing process will be that grant-maintained schools will have many more than the 2 per cent. of children with statements and children will lose out as the statements become more vague, because the LEA will not be able to fund them properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for spending some time on what could become a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is the Government's intention, based on the Audit Commission and HMI report on special education, that a statement will be clear, precise and show the educational and non-educational needs of a child. If that can be achieved to the satisfaction of the parents, the office of standards in education, the LEA and the Audit Commission, the first of the dangers to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) referred should not occur. Statements should be written to cover the needs of the child and should not be based on what money is available for that child. If that is not the Government's intention, the children will not receive a fair deal from the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reports and what has been said about welfare suggest that the Government want to ensure that a child who has severe learning problems will receive, through a statement, the proper provision for his needs. That process should not be shackled or limited in any way by questions of finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the important question of the financing of maintained and grant-maintained schools. It cannot be a cash-limited operation and I hope that the Government will say that cash limits will not be imposed for children with statements. Of course, there is an overall limit on educational spending, but that raises questions about provision for other children and, especially, those with special needs that are not deemed to be sufficiently serious for there to be a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering the issue in the context of a system of assessment for children which means that there will be a clear record of achievement. By the time a child goes to a comprehensive school, his or her special educational needs—whether or not the child is statemented—should be very clear. Therefore, parents who feel that the school is not making sufficient provision for their child along the lines set out by the education Acts, should have the same recourse to appeals or, ultimately, to the law. We should get a clear statement from the Government on the way in which they think that provision will be made for children with special needs and whether they intend to issue specific guidelines when a child does not have a statement, but still requires special help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>895</span>
If conditions remain the same, there will be moves—particularly in grant-maintained schools—to exert pressures, which could result in more children being excluded. Some provisions in the Bill relate to the ability of an LEA to send a child to a particular school, although governors will have the right to appeal: that may be a way to prevent too many exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding is important for children who are not statemented but who have special needs that may require the provision of equipment. Do the Government intend to make specific provision to allow grant-maintained schools to buy equipment that may be needed, for example, by a child who has a slight hearing impairment or by a child who needs specific equipment because of a physical disability? Will there be a banded system, in which the child will be categorised and the school will receive a certain sum of money, depending on the number of children in specific categories, but without statements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important—perhaps the most important one that we shall have to resolve. There is a severe danger that the Government may be tempted to maintain something akin to the additional expenditure that is currently provided for grant-maintained schools—the schools think of that as a short-term bribe, which will perpetuate injustice. Alternatively, because of financial pressures, the Government will be forced to bring the two systems closer together. Therefore, the original perceived advantages of the extra funding will quickly disappear. We hope that the Government will study the issue seriously and tell us how they hope to maintain fairness between grant-maintained schools and LEA schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than being a snowball rolling down a hillside, about to turn into an avalanche, the grant-maintained movement is stuttering along. A few schools will make applications but there is good evidence that most are rejecting grant-maintained status. Such provision will not prove to be a huge problem but, in fairness to all schools, the Government must resolve it. I hope that they will make it clear that future spending on grant-maintained and local authority-maintained schools will include fair and sufficient provision for children with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For some of the reasons outlined by my hon. Friends, the amendments are significant for children with special education needs. They also relate to the issue of the age-weighted pupil amount that is given through a local management of schools funding formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for returning to an issue debated by the Committee when we considered earlier amendments—the funding of grant-maintained schools. We wish to establish a clear link between the levels of funding in a local education authority and those that will be received by a grant-maintained school within its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>896</span>
The amendments are significant because they provide the Minister with an opportunity to clarify the Government's thinking on the funding of grant-maintained schools. Just before Christmas, the Government published their consultation paper on the financial arrangements for such schools but it raised more questions than it answered. As a result, those schools that are considering opting out of local authority responsibility or care do not know what they are voting for because they do not know the funding arrangements on offer from the Government. I hope that the Minister will clarify what they will be voting for, for the benefit of parents. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear the Minister saying that there is no chance that he will provide that clarification, so the message to parents is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the simple reason that, while we are still consulting, I cannot pre-empt the results of that consultation. Given all that was said by Opposition Members, they would be shocked and horrified if I attempted to do so. I hope that Opposition Members will understand that, as we are consulting, on next year's arrangements for grant-maintained schools and the common funding formula, it would be inappropriate, and the Committee would not be the right place, for me to provide the details that the hon. Gentleman requested. That would be for another time and another place. I am sure that he understands that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's refusal to clarify the Government's funding intentions adds to the chaos and confusion about grant-maintained schools. His message is clear—he cannot give parents who may be considering voting on grant-maintained status any idea of the funding arrangements for such schools. That is a terrible admission from the Minister who has responsibility for schools, yet the same Minister is piloting through a Bill that encourages schools to achieve grant-maintained status. It would have been far better if the consultation had been completed before the Bill came before Parliament, but the Government were in such a rush to push through the Bill that consultation is still taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know the Government's intentions on funding because we have seen what has happened over the past two or three years to the schools that have achieved grant-maintained status. Let us consider the early schools that achieved such status, specifically in relation to the annual maintenance grant, with which the amendments deal. The first group of schools to achieve grant-maintained status—those that opted out before April 1991—were given a generous deal—a cash-protected, central, annual maintenance grant at either the 1990–91 level, or the 1991–92 level, whichever was greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second wave of schools, which opted out between April 1991 and April 1992, were cash protected for their central, annual maintenance grant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>897</span>
at the 1991–92 level, even if that was lower than the 1990–91 level. Those schools had no choice; the generous deal was not on the table for them. So, the treatment of the second wave was slightly less generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture for the third wave was even worse. For schools that opted out after April 1992 and were in the first 15 per cent. of schools within their local authority area to do so, their annual maintenance grant was tied to 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bad news for schools in the fourth category—those that opted out after April 1992 but were not in the first 15 per cent. to do so—was that their central, annual maintenance grant was based on the actual level of delegation in their local education authority area, which could have been more or less than the 15 per cent., but with no protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally, generous amounts of cash were on offer, but there are now four different categories of grant-maintained school within a local authority area. The way in which the criteria for those categories were arrived at may seem abstract and dry, so a real example may be of benefit to the Committee. It comes from an outer London borough and shows that a school in the first wave of schools to opt out received a central, annual maintenance grant of £320,000. A similar school opting out today would receive only £220,000—£100,000 less than it would have received had they been in the first wave of schools to opt out. Therefore, the generous amounts on offer just two or three years ago are no longer available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman's remarks, which confirm a long-held view of mine that the principal attraction of grant-maintained status is not the additional funding that schools attract, but the greater freedom that they enjoy. My argument is underlined by what the hon. Gentleman says. He states clearly that the funding available to grant-maintained schools has decreased, yet the number of schools applying for grant-maintained status has increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, especially as the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to paint a picture to show that the Government are moving away from their position of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>898</span>
18 months ago, when they proclaimed—as the Prime Minister did in correspondence—that the grant-maintained sector would receive preferential treatment. The Government are silent about future funding arrangements, because grant-maintained schools will receive a decreasing amount of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wishes to be fair. For the record, we have not been silent. We have been so eloquent that we produce consultation papers regularly. We shall choose the best way forward through consultation. We are not prepared to pre-empt the consultation and outline future arrangements simply to satisfy the Opposition or the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will find it difficult to satisfy the whole Committee. However, I am worried that the Minister's explanation will not satisfy parents who are considering whether to vote for grant-maintained status. How will parents vote? Will they vote for the greater independence that, according to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, grant-maintained status will provide? If that is why they should vote to opt out, the Government should state that. The Government have also claimed that opting out will lead to financial benefits and additional resources. The intervention of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was important because of his chairmanship of the Conservative Back-Bench education committee. Does he claim that there will be no extra resources for grant-maintained schools? The emphasis of the debate must shift to greater delegation and freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts words in my mouth. I stressed the importance of the greater freedom that grant-maintained schools enjoy. I said that that, not possible additional funding, is the principal, but not the only attraction of grant-maintained status. If my hon. Friend the Minister had answered the question that he was asked, he would have been accused of pre-empting the consultation process. The Opposition would have been the first to make such an accusation. The hon.

Government. Almost certainly, the Chancellor will announce in the Budget a public sector borrowing requirement of some £50 billion. In the light of that, how will additional resources be made available for grant-maintained schools? We are worried about the matter because, as the previous Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), now the Home Secretary, said as more schools achieve grant-maintained status—at that time, fewer than 200 schools had—less money would be made available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Secretary of State made a bid to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for, as part of the autumn spending round, additional sums to be made available to the grant-maintained school sector. When the settlement was finally reached, the Chief Secretary refused that bid. Effectively, the Minister is in such an uncomfortable position because of the dead hand of the Treasury. He cannot give guarantees about the future funding arrangements for grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two years ago, the Government were boasting about the bribes that were available to schools to opt out.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's important intervention has dealt with the key issue. The debate and agenda on the grant-maintained sector has now changed. Whatever the fine words of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, when considering the ballot many parents would have voted on the basis that they thought that their schools would receive additional money. Furthermore, much of the publicity issued by those arguing for grant-maintained status concentrates on the additional resources that they believe will be made available to their schools as a result of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message from the Minister is clear: there can be no such guarantees. The Treasury is making it plain that additional public expenditure is not available. The grant-maintained schools initiative will no longer be pushed foward by financial incentives. The Government are looking at other ways in which that can be done. The reason why is clear and that is recognised by the Government. Labour, Conservative and Liberal LEAs overspend on their standard spending assessment. The Government have laid down what they should be spending on education, and what they believe should be an appropriate level of spending to deliver a quality service. The Department of the Environment figures show that two thirds of LEAs ignore the scriptures of central Government and overspend by more than £500 million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a code use by the Government to describe local authorities that meet local needs. However, that creates a problem for public expenditure generally. Such local authorities spend over £500 million more than the Government would like them to spend. The crux of the Government's problem in coming forward with a common funding formula is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said, they cannot satisfy the Treasury. The Treasury is clearly saying that no additional resources will be made available.

The agenda has moved dramatically. It is no longer a question of grant-maintained schools having additional money. the amendment would ensure that they will at least be funded at the level of local education authority schools. We shall safeguard that. The worry is that if the link with the local authority expenditure is broken, as the Minister said, things could worsen for grant-maintained schools. What a change in the debate. It is no longer a question of extra money, as we heard this afternoon; it is doubtful that those schools will keep what they would otherwise get under local education authorities. If the Government refuse to accept the amendments, the link will be broken, and grant-maintained schools will be less generously funded. Indeed, the Government have to break the link because they cannot afford to fund those schools at the present level—it would mean an extra £524 million a year of extra public expenditure. That is bad news for those schools; they will be funded at a reduced rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the total for distribution to GM schools will be based upon the Standard Spending Assessment… But there will be a link to local authority budgets as necessary…".</p></blockquote>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper talks about a common funding formula based on the standard spending assessment, and the link with historic local authority spending. The Minister has said to the Committee that the link with local authority spending will be broken. Once that link is broken, we shall have to rely on the standing spending assessment. Reliance on the standing spending assessment alone will mean cuts—massive cuts of over £500 million in two thirds of local education authorities. The amendments would ensure that the link is maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the standing spending assessment has become a Government totem. We reject that. We know that such centrally determined levels will be determined not by the Minister but by his colleagues at No. 11 Downing Street—the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Educational considerations will be out of the window and the decision will be determined by the Government's financial problems. We make no apology for safeguarding, with the amendments, the schools in most education authorities that would be worse off if they achieved grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not interesting to observe how the debate has changed? The goodies are no longer on offer. It is the end of the gravy train for grant-maintained schools. We are now debating an amendment that would protect the present funding levels of grant-maintained schools. The Government's rejection of the amendments clearly signals that the link referred to by the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight), in relation to the consultation document, will not exist. The link cannot be guaranteed. The message is stark, plain and clear that the Government cannot fund those schools in the way that they are funded at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate, including interventions from the Minister and his colleagues, has been important. Those interventions revealed that no additional resources are available. It is time that the Government came clean about their funding arrangements for grant-maintained schools. The message for parents who are considering voting on opting out is "Wait and see". The Government do not yet know what the funding arrangements will be. Why on earth should parents vote for grant-maintained status when they also do not know what they will be voting for? The amendments would clarify the position, which is why we commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are vital because the law owes an essential duty to parents to ensure that there is equity and fairness in the distribution of resources between schools—whether it is between GM schools or between GM schools and LEA schools. The amendment would enshrine that principle of fair
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>902</span>
funding in the Bill. I am sure that even Conservative Members want all parents and pupils to be given the same treatment and do not want parents and pupils in different schools to be treated differently just as a result of the school that the pupils attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disparity between schools will lead to local jealousies, a lack of local co-operation and local suspicions, which will degenerate into an unhealthy atmosphere. In many schools in the LEA sector, there is evidence of shared facilities, shared ideas and the cross-fertilisation of ideas. In my area, there is an excellent sharing of sixth forms. If there were large disparities in the way that funds were allocated between one sector of schools and another, many such arrangements would rapidly break down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to some matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and to the fact that problems are already occurring within the GM sector, in which there is disparity between the funding for one school and another. I shall suggest how the Government's figures do not add up to enable parents to make rational decisions in such matters. I shall refer to an outer London authority that has often been described as a flagship authority—I believe that one Minister used that term. Shortly, 76 per cent. of schools in the secondary sector of that authority will have opted out. That gives us a glimpse into the future, which may help parents when they are considering whether their schools should opt out. That view down the road may reveal the calamities that befell the people who went before them, because that familiar twin-headed hydra—chaos and confusion—is looming on the horizon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not pre-empt the outcome of the consultation, and the Minister rightly declined to do so. However, one of the proposals was that grant-maintained schools should maintain their 1992–93 budgets, on top of which they would receive 14 per cent. of the local authority budget. Applying that formula to the out-of-London borough that I mentioned would mean that the 76 per cent. of its secondary schools that had become grant maintained by April would have their funding maintained at the previous level. Yet that authority must make budget cuts of nearly £15 million, of which between £6 million and £8 million must be made in the education budget. Does that mean that the LEA schools—including those which may subsequently become grant maintained—would have to share a budget total that had been reduced by £8 million? My point is that cuts will hurt both LEA schools and those that are not yet grant maintained. I am sure that that area's parents will be mindful of that when they consider ballots for grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know how Ministers will react when it becomes clear that the consultation papers propose that extra funding be given to grant-maintained schools. Where will the money come from if other schools opt out? Will the Minister find another pot of money? Will he go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and say, "I know there's a recession
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>903</span>
and there are a few difficulties with the Budget, but do you think you can find a few million pounds more? I've got a problem: I won't be able to fund new GM schools at the same level as the ones that opted out a year or so ago." I should be interested to hear that conversation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Erewash raised an important point, upon which my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend also touched, about the cash grant available to fund GM schools. Within the authority that I described, one school opted out in the first tranche. It has a protected central cash grant of 17 per cent. Only 13.9 per cent. of that local authority's grant is not delegated. That school receives £65,000 a year more than if it had not become grant maintained. How do other GM schools react to that? Because it was in the first tranche, that school appears highly favoured in terms of the grant that it receives which, presumably, will remain high. If one school receives more and the budget aggregate is not increased, we can only assume that other schools will get less. The message for parents in that area will be that schools that opt out from now on will receive less money. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth confirmed that parents should no longer consider the financial aspects of going grant maintained. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister needs to answer the question. There is already disparity between grant-maintained schools. The future looks bleak unless the Minister can announce that considerably more money will be available for education. This matter must be resolved. Some authorities—outer London authorities that have been described by Conservative Members as flagship authorities—will be in a serious position. They have been described as going down a financial black hole. The Minister must tackle these problems urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend strongly amendment No. 566 not only because it secures fair resources and funding for schools but because it will give parents confidence in local education authorities and in the legislation. It will also ensure that the Government do not get into the financial chaos and confusion that will inevitably ensue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few points. First, let me relate experience in Cambridgeshire, where many schools have opted for grant-maintained status and the consequent effect on LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools are funded by an annual maintenance grant when they first assume that status. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said that there are a number of methods of funding, which depend upon the time the school opted out of local authority control. Whatever method is used, it is important that the Government accept that there should not be a disincentive to LEAs to delegate the maximum amount from the budget for schools that are under LEA management. I shall give an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>904</span>
At present, 85 per cent. is the minimum amount of a potential school's budget that it can delegate under local management. A number of LEAs in my area in the south-east and east of England delegate a great deal more. I understand that Hertfordshire proposes to delegate 92 per cent. of potential school budget in the coming financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the circumstances in which a school gets an add-on of, say, 14 or 15 per cent. when more than 85 per cent. is delegated under local management. In Hertfordshire, 92 per cent. of the potential school's budget is already with the LEA-maintained school. When it becomes grant maintained, the school will receive an additional 15 per cent. of the 92 per cent. Therefore it receives 106 per cent. However, where an authority delegates only the minimum 85 per cent. an opted-out school will receive that percentage plus 15 per cent. of 85 per cent., which totals only 98 per cent. of the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cannot be right. It will result in a disincentive for LEAs to delegate more than the minimum 85 per cent. It will mean that LEAs which do what the Government asked—generally Conservative-controlled authorities—will be increasingly penalised because they delegate a greater amount than the Government specify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition accept that grant-maintained schools will not benefit from the economies of scale from which LEA-maintained schools benefit. It is not so easy for grant-maintained schools to benefit from the central purchasing systems by which schools receive equipment and so on at large discounts. We accept that and realise that such purchases will be more expensive for grant-maintained schools. However, I understand that a proportion of the extra budget that they are now being allocated is accounted for by money to cope with that expense, and I am worried that that money has been taken from the central, local education authority budget. Other schools have less money to spend, simply because grant-maintained schools do not take account of such economies of scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A most apt remark, which I should like to be remembered in all schools were applications for grant-maintained status are contemplated, was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only free cheese is on a mousetrap."</p></blockquote>
I, like other hon. Members, read the paper on the common funding formula very carefully over Christmas. Some of us have peculiar ways of spending Christmas, but it was an important paper and I am sure that all Opposition Members read it carefully. It occurred to me that "common funding formula" is rather a misnomer, because the formula is not common to grant-maintained and local education authority schools. We should be trying to ensure a level playing field and parity of finance and expenditure between the two sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to end by describing the effects on schools in my constituency of the very low standard
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>905</span>
spending assessment in Cambridgeshire and the squeeze on central funding. Many schools in Cambridgeshire have opted out. That is not the case in Cambridge, but the resulting squeeze on local education authority finance has affected many schools in my constituency. One economy has been made by the local education authority by not increasing spending on special educational needs as the number of statemented children in the authority has increased. That has had a devastating effect on the amount of support in the classroom for children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parent came to one of my surgeries about 10 days ago with her five-year-old son, Robert. He had a statement, which she brought for me to read. It said that he needed a high level of adult input. He has learning difficulties and I believe that it is difficult to keep his attention. In an ordinary classroom situation he would, I think, without support, find it difficult to learn. There is also a danger that he would distract the teacher's attention from the other children in the class. That is why the statement stipulated that he should have a high level of adult input.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the cuts made by the local education authority, related to the squeeze on central funds, it has been possible to allocate Robert only 12 and a half hours of learning support assistance. The school to which he has been allocated, Priory infants school in Cambridge, has decided that it cannot, therefore, give this child, who has reached statutory school age, more than 12 and a half hours of schooling a week. The local education authority can give him only so many hours of the adult support that he so desperately needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is news today that capping limits will be raised, so Cambridgeshire local education authority may be able to spend additional money by charging council tax payers more. Some of the problems may be alleviated, but the Government should recognise that the squeeze on local authority spending is causing hardship and great difficulty in the Conservative heartlands where they would expect to gain most support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition consider it important that there should be a level playing field not only for grant-maintained schools, so that they may be sure of their long-term funding, but for the local education authority sector, which should not be squeezed out of existence. I am sure that the Committee will agree that the amendment is a fair way of achieving that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate as funding is an important aspect of running any school. It is not the only factor—in many respects educational performance is more important. Although I would not disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth that funding is not the crucial reason for acquiring grant-maintained status, it would be wrong to ignore the fact that it is a factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>906</span>
Many schools which have successfully managed their financial affairs under the local management of schools have wondered why a percentage of their funding—often 15 per cent., although earlier it was more and in some areas less—has been held back by the local education authority in order to provide some services direct to the school. Given their success in running their own budgets, they have asked why they should not go the whole hog and have control of all the funds. For some schools that has been important; for others, the desire to have greater control in the broadest sense has been a key factor, particularly in areas where they have had less faith in their LEA, or in cases where schools positively want to manage their own affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a good principle that schools should have full control of their finances. LMS has shown that that enables them to make more effective use of that money. Few would dispute that LMS has been a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate some Opposition members of the Committee, especially the hon. Member for Wallsend, have tried to muddy the waters and create uncertainty where uncertainty does not need to exist. They are so scared that schools will decide to opt out in droves that they want to create great uncertainty about funding. I concede that there is too much inertia in the education system. The more uncertainty Opposition members can create, the more they hope to prevent schools from taking the decision to opt out after a democratic vote by parents in favour of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend said that it was the end of the gravy train. What an appalling statement—as though schools opted out only to get on to the gravy train. Given that money is held back by he LEA—rightly, for services that it provides—a school that opts out of LEA control must be entitled to more funding than it would have received if it had remained under LEA control. The suggestion that if a school opts out it will not receive any extra funding is wrong, deliberately misleading and should be firmly quashed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the current basis of funding causes some difficulties for LEAs. If some funds are held centrally and, one by one, schools opt out the savings the LEA can make as the schools opt out do not necessarily coincide with the rate of withdrawal of funds. However, some LEAs protest too much and they should make far more determined efforts to reduce their central bureaucracy in order to get their costs more in line with the finances available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend about the tendency of LEAs to protest too much if they are forced to make changes as a result of a significant number of their schools becoming grant maintained. For example, in some LEAs the majority of those who are trained as teachers do not teach regularly in the classroom. Equally in other LEAs, a majority of the people employed by the education department are not teachers or connected with teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know LEAs, especially some that are Labour controlled, in which the efficiency of the LEA is not taken for granted as it needs to be if one automatically assumes that they will be in difficulties as their available expenditure is reduced as more schools become grant maintained. Some LEAs view the grant-maintained process as a way in which to reorganise themselves in order to provide greater efficiency on behalf of the ratepayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that more money being devolved to schools by whatever means—through the local management of schools or through schools going the whole hog and opting out—leads to better value for money because schools know which services they want to buy. I accept my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider the funding of grant-maintained schools. That is why I welcome the consultation document, which is important. It is not a black and white document because it recognises some of the difficulties of having an equitable basis for funding. Some people ask why we do not simply fund all the schools according to SSAs. That would be a wonderful trap in which to fall because, as has rightly been pointed out, some LEAs already spend above SSA. That would prevent a tranche of schools from opting out, which would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a system that treats schools fairly. The consultation document puts forward proposals that attempt to ensure a reasonable basis for funding. I look forward to seeing the response to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is seductive. I hope that I have not misread it or misinterpreted it, particularly paragraph (c). It puts the case for a formal link with LEA expenditure, regardless of how that expenditure alters. There is difficulty with that because some LEAs increase spending and some decrease it. We need to examine that carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>908</span>
What should impinge on or alter a grant-maintained school's funding? It would be better to wait for the results of the consultation than to jump to conclusions about what is the right basis for funding. I want to repeat the important point that convinced me to speak. Labour Members were suggesting that a school would be worse off financially if it opted out of LEA control. That is totally and utterly wrong—I reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government attribute some of the supposed successes of grant-maintained schools to the increase in their resources as a result of their new status. Those increases include a share of the former LEA's central costs. The status enjoyed by schools that have opted out has also been derived from their enhanced capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's figures show that the capital works programme in grant-maintained schools totalled more than twice as much per pupil than in LEA schools. The 1991–92 figures are £231 compared to £109. For the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) to say that there has not been a gravy train is beyond belief—if that is not a gravy train. I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In August 1991, the Prime Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have made no secret of the fact that grant-maintained schools get preferential treatment in allocating grants to capital expenditure."</p></blockquote>
In their policy rhetoric, the Government have constantly obscured the amounts of public money devoted to grant-maintained schools' capital grants. It was only in 1988 that the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), who was then Secretary of State, commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our policy of financial neutrality towards grant maintained schools is the same in respect of capital expenditure".</p></blockquote>
That clearly was not the case. Bribery has been an important feature of schools opting out since the process began after the Education Reform Act 1988. Given the existence of a national curriculum, national assessment and the proposal for a national funding agency, the time has come for national guaranteed levels of funding for all schools, not just grant-maintained schools. I have stated that previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have a national curriculum, a national assessment and a proposal for a national funding agency, so the time has come for guaranteed levels of funding for all schools, including those in the grant-maintained and local education authority sectors. The White Paper's proposal for a common funding formula based on standard spending assessments, with the more detailed consultation that followed, avoids any commitment to a national formula. If it is implemented, it will cause severe problems. In particular, I regard it as a threat to primary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, in arriving at their solution to all secondary schools in an LEA becoming grant maintained, have neglected to consider the knock-on effect for the many LEA primary schools remaining. Local education authorities, deprived of their role as provider to secondary schools and relieved of the requirement to maintain an education committee, their profile will inevitably be reduced. Primary schools, however, have traditionally relied more on LEA support services than have secondary schools, particularly since the imposition of the national curriculum and related assessment. They will continue to do so for some time. Significant reductions in LEA services to schools will result in primary schools being disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, many LEAs have been able to use their discretion to protect small primary schools from the anomalies of formula finding, principally through the provision of small school subsidies. With LEAs deprived of their role as strategic providers of school budgets and their high profile in determining the future of local education, non-grant-maintained primary schools have no assurances that they will not lose out once a common formula funding replaces an LEA budget. In 	<i>The Guardian</i> on 17 March 1992, the previous Secretary of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"most local authorities will directly manage some primary schools for a long time to come".</p></blockquote>
If that is still to be believed, LEA primary schools are to be made extremely vulnerable by the common funding formula proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much this afternoon and in previous debates about the standing spending assessment. The Government must be aware that, by using the SSA to determine the formula for distribution of funds to grant-maintained schools, they will have to face problems with schools in LEAs that spend in excess of their SSAs. The Government have found it impossible to reconcile their policies to squeeze LEA spending and to offer bribes to individual schools to become grant maintained. They face the potential embarrassment of imposing a CFF lower than a local education authority's current expenditure, which penalises existing "flagship" grant-maintained schools. Even if a reduction in their funding is not an immediate result of the establishment of a CFF but is phased in over two or three years, the immediate attraction of grant-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>910</span>
maintained status will have been extinguished. The Government cannot achieve parity between all schools without making some demand on public expenditure, unless they are prepared to betray the first supporters of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to be regretted that repeated calls for the Government to publish their criteria for determining SSAs have remained unheeded. If those criteria were published, that would at least provide the clean state on which the proposed consultation with LEAs and grant-maintained schools on the application of the common funding formula should be based. It would also enable national comparisons to be made for the purposes of consistency and cohesion and would facilitate the identification of the objective differences between schools, which should then be taken into account in devising a formula. The proposed 	<i>ad hoc</i> application of the common funding formula, LEA by LEA, is a recipe for acrimony and fragmentation and is unlikely to facilitate the parity between all schools which public expenditure demands and which is a necessity.

You might think, Sir John, that I am going slightly away from the amendment, but I am trying to address the issue from a different angle. We need a national common formula to fund our schools and then the problems of the present formula funding will disappear. The news that specific and capital grants are to be kept under review is not illuminating for the grant-maintained status proposal. Many schools that, after the general election, were considering opting out will now have to consider their position seriously. The bribery which occurred before the general election was a significant factor in schools in causing schools to want to opt out. Because of the Government's proposals in their consultation document, many schools will have to reconsider their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence in the clause of an undertaking to establish a national minimum level of funding for education is a grave mistake. The proposal amounts to a piecemeal, but none the less deliberate, augmentation of the Government's control over the education service and a muffling of the obvious demands of parents and teachers on the public expenditure purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new draft circular "A Common Funding Formula for Grant Maintained Schools" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for (pupils who have) the severest educational needs (with statements) … the LEA will be responsible for funding the necessary provision additional to that which the school is resourced to provide."</p></blockquote>
The Government also envisage that the proposed common funding formula for grant-maintained schools in the document should include a specific allowance for additional educational needs for non-statemented pupils. The document envisages a return to a crude free school meals proxy indicator with just one other factor, ethnic groups. Many authorities are now developing sensitive special needs audits for

their local management of schools non-statemented special educational needs funding, which would be put in jeopardy by the crude measurement of free school meals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LEA statement for an individual pupil will not carry additional resources for knock-on effects of admission. In particular, the recent report, "Within Reach", commissioned from Coopers and Lybrand by the Spastics Society and the National Union of Teachers, to which I previously referred, identifies the cost of improving access to schools for pupils with special educational needs. The report concludes that there are significant initial costs involved in the integration of pupils with physical and sensory disabilities in the key area of premises conversion. The report states that, once the initial costs have been met, the
	<br><blockquote><p>"costs of progressing integration are not... particularly high."</p></blockquote>
Grants to individual schools should take account of the need to allow for additional resources for pupils with special educational needs, with or without statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be specific about the particular special needs of non-statemented pupils because they might be missed by the crude measures envisaged in the Government's consultative document. The Audit Commission and HMI report on special education provision recognised that funding inadequacies have existed since the 1981 Act came into force and have been complicated further by the 1988 Act. There has also been a failure to allocate specific resources to pupils with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have adopted some of the principal recommendations in the report. However, one key recommendation has been ignored:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Changes are required to give LEAs an incentive to implement the 1981 Act. Funding mechanisms could be devised to create incentives for LEAs to succeed in meeting the needs of the least able pupils."</p></blockquote>
The Government are committed to considering pump-priming for pupils with special educational needs in Wales. Why just in Wales; why not in England? We all want schools to provide high-quality education for all pupils with special educational needs, whether or not they are statemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem that underlies the debate can be put simply. Clause 71 will enable the funding of grant-maintained schools to be carried out by the funding agency for schools. It deliberately does not set out any detailed funding formula—that would be unwise. If hon. Members give the matter a moment's thought, they will realise that that makes sense. Circumstances change, so to try to pin down detailed funding arrangements in the Bill would not be productive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have missed the point of the amendment. I hope that he did not. The point is very clear. The amendment would not require detail; it would require a statement of principle that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>912</span>
grant-maintained sector will be funded at least at the level of LEA schools. I hope that the Minister will endorse the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not endorse the amendment, partly because it would not even achieve the objective that the hon. Gentleman desires, and also because it is so vague as to be meaningless. The amendment does not carry the argument forward effectively, so I believe that the Committee will reject it.

My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East made my speech for me, and an excellent speech it was, too. He said in his characteristically thoughtful and knowledgable way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Those are two traits which I am rarely accused of having; that is why I said that about my hon. Friend. He put his finger on the point: during a period of consultation it would be unwise for the Committee to leap to premature conclusions, however tempted Opposition Members may be. They have the privilege of opposition, of which they are taking full advantage to make vague, unspecified, open-ended promises to almost anyone that they can target. We understand that that is what opposition is about. Fortunately, the Opposition are usually rumbled and people do not believe them. That has happened four times in succession and I have every reason to believe that it will happen again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has reinforced our arguments. He says that the Labour party wishes to maintain levels of spending on schools—tax and spend is the description that he would normally use. The Government say "No, we can't do that." We have a £50 billion public sector borrowing requirement: the Minister must detest the thought of that, given his political track record. He insists that spending must be reduced. The amendments make the point that the money is not there. The Minister has confirmed that by making the accusation—as the Government do—that Labour is the spending party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fought an election on that issue only a few months ago and we know the result. I am quite relaxed about that; the hon. Gentleman is obviously still hurting. I understand that and sympathise with him, but I shall not rehearse that whole argument—we shall do that in four years' time and rerun the whole thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was intriguing that, as often happens in the Committee, Labour Members tried to have it not just two ways but every which way. The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) accused us of running a gravy train and—kindly—repeated the promise made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that we shall favour grant-maintained schools in our capital allocation. The hon. Gentleman talked about the "bribery" of grant-maintained schools. He reinforced a long-standing suspicion that the Government are rather in favour of grant-maintained schools and would like to help them along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets too excited, may I say that his comments should be set against the arguments of some of his colleagues that grant-maintained schools are about to suffer horribly in the future? I ask Labour Members to have a discussion before the next sitting of the Committee and to decide which accusation they want to make, because they cannot make both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not had the benefit of long experience in local government. If he had, he would be aware of the difference between revenue and capital spending. The clause is nothing to do with capital spending; it concerns revenue. The consultation documents issued before Christmas deal only with revenue. We are addressing the matter of revenue in the clause. What can the Minister tell parents of children in schools that are considering voting on opting out about revenue? Would he advise them to wait? Should not his advice be that, because of the uncertainty created by the Government's inaction, there should be no more ballots on opting out while the Government consult?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall choose what I say to parents; the hon. Gentleman need not write my script for me. Quite simply, the Secretary of State has often repeated his guarantee that grant-maintained schools will always receive additional funding to match their additional responsibilities. That guarantee remains. To parents of children at any school contemplating grant-maintained status, I would say, "Go to your nearest grant-maintained school and have a chat. Talk to those involved about their experience, about whether they can demonstrate that their school and its quality of education have improved. Go and talk to them. Don't take the word of the hon. Member for Wallsend for it. Don't even take my word for it." I am sufficiently confident about the matter to make that open invitation to talk to people who have experienced grant-maintained status and ask them what it is like. It is that simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the Minister's argument is that there are at least four types of funding for grant-maintained schools. As more schools opt out, the so-called gravy train is drying up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government favour grant-maintained schools. Do they favour them at the expense of schools that remain under local education authority control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the case. That brings me neatly to another point. The hon. Member for Wallsend made enormously heavy weather of the difficulty and trauma for schools that are considering or have been given grant-maintained status of their inability to predict their funding. In reality, schools in the LEA sector cannot predict their funding either. In this uncertain world, no one can predict that with the certainty that the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of at least one education authority that may have to claw back money from its schools this year
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>914</span>
because it made an administrative blunder in the past by overpaying them. I sympathise with all involved in such problems. The hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) is being a trifle mischievous if he is trying to imply that LEA-maintained schools have a degree of certainty that grant-maintained schools cannot and will not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rely on the power of the democratic process. The key difference is that schools that are part of the local authority sector will continue to be funded, and they are overfunded on the Government's criteria for standard spending assessments at present because local councils are accountable and know that parents will vote for spending on schools through the ballot box. A funding agency responsible only to the Secretary of State will do what he instructs, which will be in line with Treasury diktat, based on the standard spending assessment. That is the crucial difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one believes that, one will believe almost anything. I do not accept a word of that analysis. Let me move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, will he echo the advice of one of his civil servants given at a meeting in Sheffield on Friday convened, at public expense, to promote the Government's policy of grant-maintained schools? When asked about the financial implications of opting out he replied that if schools were thinking of opting out for the money, they should think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always listen carefully to my officials, and then I make up my own mind. That is what I advise parents to do—to listen to advice from different quarters and then make up their minds. That is what the balloting procedure is all about. The hon. Member for Wallsend has just repeated his belief in the democratic process. We share that belief. This is all about a democratic process that allows and encourages parents to consider what benefits for finance and independence grant-maintained status can offer schools before they make their judgment. Many parents say yes and some say no. That is as it should be and how it should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing the relationship between schools becoming grant maintained and the democratic process. Will the Minister admit that in the ballot by which a school chooses whether or not to opt out, the democratic process is flawed? Many of the people whose taxes contribute to a school's funding are excluded from the balloting process. As a result, the cry of "No taxation without representation" might be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is possible, but I do not think that that is much of a problem. I have been passed a useful note by my officials, which I shall read out verbatim:

My information was that that was said by a civil servant. I am glad that the head of a grant-maintained school said it and that the record has been set right. Of course, that head was invited by the Department for Education and may have been paid for his presence from taxpayers' money. Who knows? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I said, "may have been". It is significant that the head of a grant-maintained school, who has experience of grant-maintained status, casts doubt on its financial security and advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's desperation is clear. I shall not stoop to answer that point, except to stress that the head would not have been paid to appear at the conference.

The hon. Member for City of Durham made a revealing point, which raises a difficulty. It would be wonderful if we could devise a simple, elegant, universal, all-embracing, national common funding formula. I share the hon. Gentleman's yearning for that. If the hon. Gentleman can suggest a workable formula that would not lead to his friends losing out to an unacceptable extent, I would like him to share it with me. I could then consider it with my Ministerial colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister should listen carefully. Reforming SSAs would be a step in the right direction. It cannot be right for one local authority's SSA to be huge in comparison with another simply for the sake of political expediency and to help elected councillors in a Tory-controlled area. If the system were fairer, the problem would be easier to solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting a little excited and wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we shall return to that point later. The hon. Gentleman might be surprised if he knew how much I agree with him. If he chats to my hon. Friends when the Committee has adjourned, he will find that many of them agree with him. However, he will not reach the same conclusion. The authorities that he has in mind as beneficiaries of the process will be different from those that we have in mind. The authorities that he favours, which benefit from the existing regime, may suffer from the process that he describes. I give him that friendly information in case he wants to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind your caveat, Sir John, I remind the Committee that we are considering amendments that deal with funding grant-maintained schools. The consultation paper on the common funding formula is important. The Minister castigated my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham for proposing an all-embracing national funding formula for schools, yet clause 71
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>916</span>
and the common funding formula would have that effect if all schools became grant maintained. One reason for believing in local democracy is that local authorities are allowed to make some decisions about how to spend funding for schools that the Government provide and funding that they raise locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The common funding formula will not have the effect that the hon. Gentleman describes. Standard spending assessments will play a part in the process. The differing circumstances of LEAs will therefore continue to be acknowledged. We could debate—but not in Committee—different techniques and methods of establishing appropriate funding for LEAs, local authorities, and schools. Every formula would contain some anomalies. There would be winners and losers. Any new approach will cause difficulties. I do not know whether the formulation devised by the hon. Member for City of Durham has the support of his hon. Friends. That is for him to discover. It is not as easy as he suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to agree with much of what I say. Does he agree that the discrepancies between standard spending assessments in different local authorities are, in many respects, too wide at present and that SSAs should be narrowed so that the system is fairer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting and tempting suggestion. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has discussed it with his hon. Friends who represent inner-London boroughs. I invite him to do so, and if he comes away from the conversations unbruised and unblooded he might want to reflect on the direction in which he is heading. That illustrates well the difficulties involved in the vexed and tricky question of how best to fund different authorities in different circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have noted that I have not intervened in the debate so far because I want to be clear about certain matters. Does he count Westminster as an inner-city borough? Will he compare the SSA for Westminster with that for Wakefield and speculate on the discrepancy? Does not he agree that it is the over simplification of factors taken into account for SSA that has led to the nonsense that the Minister now readily admits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, now we are warming up. The hon. Gentleman says that over simplification is the problem. That is not the approach taken by the hon. Member for City of Durham. I thought that the hon. Gentleman wanted simplicity and elegance. He is suggesting that to have a multiplicity or complexity of factors, better to rearrange and massage the disposition of the resources, would mean that one might come closer to the ultimate truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SSA procedure is not as much of a state secret as Opposition Members suggest. The criteria used are common knowledge and a matter for legitimate debate. To take two random examples, if sparsity is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>917</span>
accepted as a factor—I use some of the ghastly jargon—and an authority has a large area of greatly dispersed communities and schools, that makes a strong case for additional funding to take account of those difficulties. On the other hand, there are factors to be taken into account in a densely packed inner-city urban area having a mix of people of different ethnic backgrounds whose first language is not English. Those factors produce very different results, depending on how they are applied to different authorities. I am sure that Opposition Members understand that, but it is not reflected in their remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depending on the weight given to those factors and how they are applied, there will be different results, variations, and disparities of funding. That is all we are saying. I agree more with Opposition Members than they might expect. There will be different results in applying the different factors to the variety of local authorities. It is no more complicated than that, but it is difficult to get a result that pleases, everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comparison between authorities is most interesting. For example, Lancashire and Kent are roughly the same geographical size, and have roughly the same number of school pupils. It could be argued, however, that there is greater urban deprivation in Lancashire than in Kent. Lancashire has many more people whose first language is not English. It certainly has more rural and dispersed schools. If one divides the respective SSAs for Lancashire and for Kent by the number of each county's pupils, and then multiplies the per capita figure for Kent by the number of pupils in Lancashire, Lancashire's SSA will be higher by £37 million. Why is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I would have to say that I disagree with almost every point that the hon. Gentleman made. I doubt whether schools are less dispersed in Kent than in Lancashire. Moreover, Kent has areas where deprivation and unemployment are worse than almost anywhere in Lancashire—[Hon. Members; "Where?"] From memory, Thanet is one such area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members ask the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), who knows about such matters, they will discover that what I have said has an element of truth in it. That will suffice for the moment. However, I shall not get bogged down on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hyndburn has demonstrated—and I have accepted it—that this question is worthy of debate, as it is open to genuine differences of interpretation. I do not agree with his interpretation in the examples that he gave, and have said why. The hon. Member for Hyndburn should speak to the hon. Member for Bridgend later, and he will find that I am more right than he thinks about unemployment rates in those counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to offer the Minister a specific example involving SSAs. He will know that one sixth of the total amount of SSAs is allocated on the basis of poverty and deprivation. Opposition Members agree that that is appropriate. However, the Government use the all-ages social index to judge deprivation and poverty. That index shows that Tunbridge Wells in Kent suffers greater poverty than north Tyneside. It also shows that Cheltenham suffers greater poverty than Rotherham, and that Basildon is worse off than Bolsover. Why do the Government rely on that index, which bears no relation to what is happening in our communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no, for two reasons: first, I suspect that I would risk straying too far from the amendment, and secondly the methodology of SSAs is not my ministerial responsibility. However, if Opposition Members wish to join me in asking for a review of that methodology, they may find that they are knocking on a door that is more than half open. The existing methodology is not set in concrete, nor above criticism. It should be examined every now and then. I am glad that hon. Members in the Committee share so much common ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we will return to deal more specifically with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to conclude my remarks, Sir John. I shall end with a few words about special educational needs, a matter raised by the hon. Members for Bridgend, for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) and for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present formulation is broadly correct. It is right that it should be carried forward in roughly the same form in the consultation document on the common funding formula. It would not be right to make the mechanisms applied to children with special educational needs too detailed. The cases of pupils with statements are relatively straightforward, but those of pupils with non-statemented special educational needs vary considerably in number, type and duration from school to school and from authority to authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted what the hon. Member for City of Durham said about the way in which some LEAs are experimenting with approaches that differ from the proxy method of free school meals, for example. He implied that those experiments had been more successful than we believe to be the case. Try as they might, the results are over-bureaucratic or relatively inflexible. In the end, they probably do not get much closer to the goal of identifying the client groups and channelling appropriate funds to them most efficaciously. I do not wish to rule that out, but the Department's experience is that no one has yet found a workable system that is demonstrably better or superior to the admittedly rather crude methods used now. The approach that we have taken so far and propose broadly to carry forward is appropriate.

I apologise for having spoken at length, but the debate is important. Clause 71 is an enabling clause. It will enable us to carry forward the funding arrangements as they exist now. We are consulting on the funding arrangements for existing grant-maintained schools for next year; funding will continue through the common funding formula. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying desperately to wind up, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was winding up, but I intervened because he has not answered my questions. Will the Minister answer those points now? Some of the early tranche of GM schools now have more money because the central cash grant was then fixed at 17 per cent. I referred to one school having £65,000 more than it should have had. Has that school taken funds from the aggregate of funding now available to the other schools? Does not that prejudice the schools in the LEA system, and future GM schools should some schools choose to opt out? That would create a permanent built-in disparity within an authority's area between one GM school and another, and possibly between GM and LEA schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the sense that the hon. Gentleman puts it, the answer is yes, there are different dispositions for different schools at different times and in different phases of development. There is nothing inherently and desperately difficult or wrong about that. It is probably well understood. I am not aware of existing or potential candidates for grant-maintained status getting as excited about that as the hon. Gentleman. I do not feel a particular need to defend or explain away what the hon. Gentleman said. As far as I followed him, he was making a statement of fact. However, I undertake to look in more detail at that point and give a fuller answer if required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, endlessly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, and to save having a debate later, will the Minister clarify clause 71(4)(b)? Does it mean that no schooling could be provided for 19-year-old and older pupils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an answer immediately, but I undertake to come back to it either later in this sitting or in writing. It is a detailed question and I shall not attempt to answer it on the hoof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All members of the Committee want an answer. If subsection (4)(b) precludes 19-year-olds being taught in a GM school—or any other school, for that matter—students who are studying in the third year of the sixth form, students going on to Oxford or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>920</span>
Cambridge who were doing a seventh term, could find that the funding for their education was ruled out. Before we vote on the amendment, it would be sensible to wait until the Minister has given a positive reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman speaks on a matter that is not specifically referred to in the amendment. To that extent, we should wait until the clause stand part debate. Perhaps the answer will be available then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that I have most of the answer, but I would rather not give it now, partly for the reasons that you have given, Sir John, and partly because I would rather get it absolutely correct. I would rather give the answer in the debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be out of order, but I wish to ask a simple question of the Minister. Is he in favour of ring fencing moneys for special educational needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No is the answer. We shall probably return to that in greater detail, if we ever get to part III.

I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that the amendments are superfluous and inappropriate. A detailed reading of them suggests that they would almost certainly not achieve their objectives. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the Minister has not allayed any of our fears, but I do not blame him entirely for that. The amendments are intended to improve the clause and make it more specific, but this debate is taking place when the Government's consultation paper has not received sufficient consideration by all those who have been consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Government cannot tell us what their decision will be about maintenance grants and whether they could sensibly accept the amendments. However, the Minister has prejudged the issue by saying that he does not think that the amendments will serve the purposes that we want them to. If the Minister believes that the fault lies in the drafting of the amendments and he is happy with their intentions, we would be happy for them to be redrafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-East said that the Opposition were responsible for the uncertainty in the funding formula for grant-maintained schools. In fact, the responsibility is the Government's. If the consultation paper on the common funding formula had been issued six months earlier or if the Bill had been delayed for six months, we would have known what consultees thought about the formula and the Government may have already decided how maintenance grants were to be paid. Therefore, the amendments may have been unnecessary because we would have known the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>921</span>
Government's view of the funding formula. Let us be in no doubt. It is the Government's rush to push the Bill through that has created the uncertainty about funding and has led to the fact that they have yet to make up their minds about how the funding may be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also accused unspecified Opposition Members of making vague promises about the funding of schools. In the context of the debate on the amendment, the thrust of the remarks of my hon. Friends has been the desire to ensure that all schools—whether they are LEA or grant maintained—are funded in a manner that is broadly fair and that some allowance is made for the perceived additional costs of becoming a grant-maintained school. We wish to get the Bill right through and that will be achieved if the amendment is accepted. There is nothing in the amendment that amounts to an unspecified promise to any school or local authority that there will be a spending bonanza in an unprofligate way that would be over and above what a Labour Government would do.

Special education needs form an important part of the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham raised an important point about the number of those receiving free school meals being used to assess special needs in any school. I had intended to read out clause 31 of the paper on the common funding formula with regard to one or two other matters. Considering how the debate has gone, I do not need to, except merely to say that the paper suggests that the amount of money paid based on the free school meals formula should be 100 per cent. plus an additional percentage to take account of special needs funding. However, there is no suggestion of how much that percentage should be. In the paper, the Government say that there is a problem in arriving at a suitable formula to take account of children with special educational needs in any school, but they do not hazard a guess as to how that problem might be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become apparent during the debate that the Government do not believe that there is a suitable alternative to the free school meals criterion for deciding on special educational needs funding. I appeal to the Minister to consider one or two of the experiments referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham to see whether there is a more sophisticated and accurate way to take account of special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that under the provisions in part III, money will be available to ensure that the teaching needs and support resources of a child with a statement will be accurately assessed. There is still an important gap affecting resource provision for children who are not statemented but who have special educational needs. We will no doubt discuss that when we debate the provisions in part III, when I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>922</span>
hope that we can make progress in dealing with those funding issues. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to my earlier point, as this is a serious issue? Clause 7 1(4)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Chapter, 'the purpose of the school' do not include purposes wholly referable to the provision of …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) full-time education suitable to the requirements of persons who have attained the age of nineteen years."</p></blockquote>
I am seeking from the Minister an absolute assurance that it will still be possible to educate 19-year-olds in GM or LEA schools. I am concerned about three categories of student: first, students who retake GCSEs in the first year of sixth year 12 and do so well that they go on to take A-levels over two years, which would make them 19 in their third year in the sixth form. The second category is made up of students who have had special needs requirements throughout their educational life and whose sixth forms make special provisions for them, as happens in many schools. They are very slow learners but they still gain real benefits from full-time education in a school where they feel at home and know people. Such benefit would not be derived in the same measure if they were transferred to further education establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I became aware of the third category in my recent visit to two comprehensive schools and one grammar school in my area, where a substantial number of students in their third year of the sixth form are taking S-level papers and preparing themselves for Oxford and Cambridge entrance. They are the highest fliers in the school. I seek an assurance from the Minister that those students can still be educated in GM schools and LEA schools after the legislation is passed. If they cannot, I cannot support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly to the hon. Gentleman's points. I shall do so rather carefully—unusually for me—because I want to get the words right. The intention behind the provision is to ensure that the annual maintenance grant cannot be spent on the provision of further education at school. Amendments introduced by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 enabled the provision of further education at schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to note that the prohibition would not affect the governing body's power to use AMG for providing education for a pupil who had begun his education at the school when he was younger than 19 and continues with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the technical answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. Specifically I am advised that in all three categories to which he referred, it would be in order for provision to continue to be made at the school using AMG for that purpose. I can give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an earlier debate on the funding agency I raised with the Minister a point about the statutory requirements of age five to age 16 education. The Minister says that the pupils mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport can continue their education. Will the school receive funding for those pupils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer, by implication, must be yes. I admit freely to the Committee that I always feel uneasy giving important detailed answers on the hoof to such questions. I have done my best and I think that I gave Opposition Members the assurances that they sought. In the light of the additional gloss put on by the hon. Member for Warrington, South, I want to re-examine the issue carefully and answer Opposition

Members either in writing or on a more appropriate occasion. Now, I am able to go as far as the hon. Gentleman wanted me to go in giving him the assurances that he sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter, as all Committee members realise. There are schools, particularly those with a large number of able students and those in other categories that I mentioned that could potentially not receive funding for a substantial number of students in their third year sixth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
