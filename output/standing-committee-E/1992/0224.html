	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Hedgerows Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Hedgerows Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Peter Ainsworth.</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hope that the Bill will have a speedy passage through its Committee stage. We want it to be on the statute book, although we believe that one or two aspects could be improved and, therefore have tabled several amendments. We hope that our discussions will be expeditious. The Bill is valuable as it will provide much-needed protection for this country's hedgerows and I hope that if we need more than one sitting we shall not need many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth on getting the Bill through its legislative stages and, in particular, on having overcome the hurdle of getting it to Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a common perception that the Bill is relatively insignificant and that it will affect only a few barley barons in East Anglia. That perception could not be further from the truth. The terrestrial ecology report on the removal of hedgerows in the past ten years shows that most of East Anglia's hedgerows have been removed. People who farm on the marshes in Wales, Exmoor and Dartmoor will be most affected by the Bill. Those people have small farms, with small fields surrounded by many hedgerows. They are on low incomes—lower incomes than most people in this Room. Some are on income support and have their wives going out to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman address his remarks to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) when I say that I hope that the Bill's passage will be speedy. I am sure that you, Mr. Hill, will be aware that we have tabled many amendments because, in fairness to the people to whom I have just referred, the Bill should conform to the rules of natural justice and, above all should be workable for people on low incomes, who go out in all weathers, and on whom the burden of its, provisions will fall. In the opinion of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and I, and to conform to our party's manifesto, it is essential not to wreck the Bill in any sense but to make it fairer and more workable for those who will have to operate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We hope that the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will look favourably on our amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has tabled amendments that, in some way, echo the reason for our amendments. We support the sitting motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) about the Bill's desirability. I was interested to hear him refer to his party's manifesto as the Conservative party has blocked my Hedgerows Bill for almost ten years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, I want the Bill to be an environmentally useful measure. The Minister will recall that I briefly detained the House last week when on a matter of historic significance. It would be inappropriate to go into detail now, but I have received correspondence suggesting that the Government Departments have lost important documents and letters. The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, which is deeply interested in this issue, wrote to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the autumn. It has not received a reply and I wrote to him a month ago asking him to reply. I hope that by the time we reach amendment Nos. 1 and 2, the Government will have considered the proposed destruction of enclosure hedgerows in Yorkshire because it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister responds to my amendments, I should like him to reaffirm the Government's commitment that the enclosure hedgerow requirements in the 4,000 private Acts of Enclosure which were passed by Parliament before 1840, would still have effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will understand that the implications are serious. Only a few days ago, I wrote to a farmer in my constituency who had uprooted a hedgerow. I enclosed a copy of the 1810 enclosure law to show where the hedgerow has to be permanently maintained as a condition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will know that we are discussing the sittings motion. I would be obliged if he would say whether he supports it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that, Mr. Hill. I want to save the Committee time by avoiding extra sittings and by assisting the hon. Member for Surrey, East to secure a quick passage of the Bill through the Committee. The implications are serious and we cannot duck them. The Minister needs to respond to them informatively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I informed the farmer in my constituency that by removing the enclosure hedgerow he might be sending out a signal that he wanted to surrender the land. That type of breach of condition is a serious matter. It could affect thousands of acres of lowland England and we would not want farmers, who have been plunged into many difficulties in recent years, to face an extra headache.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister, having noted what I said on Wednesday and this morning, will ensure that the Committee will be fully aware of the serious matter covered by my amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I express my pleasure of seeing you, Mr. Hill, in the Chair. If the hills are alive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
with the sound of music, there are still a few hedgerows across the fields of merry England. It is a pleasure to have an hon. Friend from just across the water chairing this Bill. I cannot think of a finer environmentalist than you, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, whose constituents were perceptive in electing him to the House. No sooner had they done so, than he awarded them by honing in on the Bill and succeeding in the ballot for private Member's Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) is a member of the Committee, because he kept hon. Members up for several hours during the night discussing the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill. If I remember correctly, he did goose impressions in the Chamber of the House and I must say that his ability to imitate a goose was remarkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Gentleman recalls only that brief extract of the speech that I made at 2 am. I was speaking in response to a point of order and a Conservative Member was lying comatose on the Benches. Mr. Deputy Speaker called the House to order and I suggested that if a Brent goose waddled into the Chamber, up the steps and along the Bench and stuck its beak into the ear of that Conservative Member and issued its alarm call it probably would not have woken him—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having observed the Brent goose in my constituency at closer quarters than I observed the hon. Member for Wentworth that evening, I can say that his imitation of the Brent goose was life-like and authentic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did it appear in 	<i>Hansard!</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speech was reported in 	<i>Hansard</i> with the appropriate accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wentworth alone kept hon. Members awake that night for more than three hours. I recall that the Dartford warbler featured in that debate. The Dartford warbler always seems to be around whenever one debates major works Bills, be they bypass or docks Bills. I have often suggested that one way of ensuring that the Dartford warbler ceases to be an endangered specie would be to introduce more works Bills as, hitherto, its habitat was unknown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the hon. Member for Wentworth because I believe that many of my hon. Friends hope that the Committee's proceedings will be completed quickly. Indeed, Opposition Members have already expressed their hope that the Committee will proceed with expedition. However, the presence of the hon. Member for Wentworth causes one to suspect that our proceedings may continue late into the evening, especially if we are to hear his entire vocabulary of birdcalls. For that reason, we should seriously debate the sittings motion this morning. It is not often appreciated that members of the Committee are volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a great pleasure to see my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and the Border (Mr. Maclean) in Committee because he represents the Government with aplomb in places such as Rio de Janeiro on matters of environmental importance to our constituents and to the world at large. Of course, in a previous incarnation, he was
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. When we discuss the Bill, therefore, it may be useful to remind members of the Committee, who have hinted at a slight frisson between landed interests and environmental lobbies, that the Minister is a supreme advocate because he has a foot firmly planted on both sides of the hedge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that we would not become involved in this sort of debate because there is no conflict between the landed interests. I represent all my constitutents—landed or otherwise. The occupiers of land will have to work with the Bill's provisions, which must be workable and fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a most important point. If there is a slight frisson in the Committee, the sittings motion may not be adequate to cover the breadth of debate that will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) was not entirely right in his intervention. I have before me a fax from Michael Ball, the National Farmers Union parliamentary branch adviser and chairman of a regional area, which states that he hopes that I will make these points concerning fanners in the strongest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a young and green candidate, I had the temerity to suggest that it might be in the interests of the farming lobby to apply for environmentally sensitive area status. I had to take a lot of criticism in the press from farmers who said that the last thing they needed on the Isle of Wight was another environmental crank. I raised the matter with the then president of the National Farmers Union and said that I did not understand why farmers on the island did not want to apply for ESA status, because they would receive considerable enhancement of their incomes for doing what they already do very well—managing the land. In my constituency, as in other rural areas, some farming families go back 300 or 400 years. I will not listen to anyone who criticises the farming lobby for not tending our inheritance in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a loss of hedgerows and perhaps we should sit all day and all night until we have discussed the Bill. I may oppose the sittings motions because, as we speak, Isle of Wight county council is considering grubbing up hedgerows at Standen heath to create a rubbish tip. I alluded to that when my hon. Friend spoke in the debate on the environment, which may be why he invited me to sit on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the sittings motion because the matter is of great urgency. I have never received a letter from a constituent about the conduct of farmers in the preservation of hedgerows, but I have received a considerable number of letters about the conduct of Isle of Wight county council concerning the ancient hedgerows on Standen heath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to see the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler), who is a Liberal Democrat, in his place, and I hope that he will be able to answer some of the criticisms that I have received from my constituents on the environmental policies of his party and the grubbing up of ancient hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that his local authority, will have no duty under clause 2? It seems that the authority will not come within the scope of the Bill and that it can continue to grub up hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. I discussed the sittings motion with my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East and told him that I might want to oppose it because the Bill deals with an urgent matter for the people of the Isle of Wight. The ancient hedgerows of Standen heath are of natural historical merit but Isle of Wight county council, against a storm of public protest, seems intent on proceeding with the acquisition of the site and the grubbing up of the hedgerows and, although it is not a subject in the Bill, the felling of ancient oaks. [Hon. Members: "Disgraceful."] Yes, it is disgraceful. The Committee should sit for as long as it takes to put the Bill on the statute book so that our hedgerows can be properly protected from the Liberal Democrat vandals who are elected to county councils under the misnomer of an environmental lobby and who then wreak havoc in constituencies such as the Isle of Wight. I am appalled by their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not cover local authorities, which I find extremely worrying. The complaints that I have received about hedgerows have been principally concerned with the actions of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has spoken eloquently on several issues which relate to the Bill and has stressed why the sittings motion should be thoroughly debated. Has he considered a concern of many of my constituents, particularly in view of his distinguished surname, about the religious connotation? Has he read the words of the prophet Isaiah who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Woe unto them that … lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Isaiah is one of my favourite prophets but that comment has not previously been drawn to my attention. I am obliged to my hon. Friend, who represents a distinguished resort—one of the premier resorts in northern Europe. I do not know whether you, Mr. Hill, are a Blackpool lights man but I must say that my hon. Friend is giving distinguished service to his constituents. I am pleased that he is knowledgeable in such matters and that his reading is impeccable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall go into the detail of the Bill when we have resolved the sittings motion, but there are many pressing issues of concern. There is concern that the Bill tries to impose on landowners a code of conduct which is not applied to public ownership. I am sure that members of the Committee will consider that issue when we debate the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was researching material to prepare for the Committee and the sittings motion, it came as a surprise to discover that there has been considerable hedgerow loss during the past 40 to 50 years, even in a constituency such as mine where there is much heritage coastline and many areas of outstanding national beauty. I thought that I represented a constituency with many hedgerows. The only complaints that I have received have been about the actions of local government rather than of farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that you, Mr. Hill, are becoming restive about the sittings motion. I sense the mood of the Committee,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
but I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, to reconsider the sittings motion. Given the urgency of the matter for the Isle of Wight, and for other constituencies—my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea nods, so there must be concern about hedgerows in Battersea—it might be better if the sittings motion were to suggest that the Committee sit all day until the House rises so that this serious matter can be given every consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The topic is wide ranging and environmentally sensitive and needs the clearest investigation and the most vigorous debate possible in the true traditions of the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has quickly established his reputation with his constituents as a defender of the environment. The last thing that he would like to have erected as his memorial is a piece of slipshod legislation that whizzed through Committee without proper scrutiny. I see him nodding. I know how thorough he is. Only the other day I heard him talking on local radio about how he had persuaded the local health authority to investigate the problems of traffic pollution and its effects on asthmatics in his constituency. I thought, "How thorough he is when it comes to defending the interests of all his constituents." I hope that he will reconsider the sittings motion and that he will tell us whether he thinks that it is adequate to meet one morning a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, unlike other members of the Committee, wish the Bill every success. I hope that we shall deal with it expeditiously. I shall therefore be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek your guidance, Mr. Hill, on a separate issue. Did you consider it in order for members of the Committee to speak on the Bill without declaring their interests? I suspect that there must be members of the Committee with portions of hedgerow and other forms of boundary delineation on their land and, before hon. Members speak, it may be appropriate if they reveal how much acreage they command and the length of hedgerow or other boundary that they may have at their disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I declare my interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessary at the moment. We are discussing the sittings motion. When we move on to the debate, it will be for individual members of the Committee to declare their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that I have a privet hedge outside my house, and your reassuring comments have put my mind at rest? I am now at ease with myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the length of the hon. Gentleman's hedge will be in inverse proportion to the length of his speech. I have a hedge which is 80 ft long and a boundary wall. I shall return to that subject in the main debate in due course. I am concerned that we may find that all of this morning's debate will be taken up by the sittings motion. I think that the motion accurately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
reflects the way in which the Committee wants to proceed and I hope that it will be passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment and Countryside (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government commend the sensible sittings motion. We hope that the Bill will be dealt with expeditiously, but I hope that people outside the House will be reassured that it will not be bounced through in a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many amendments have been tabled. I hope that when they are discussed, my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will resist some and accept some. Many of the amendments are worth further consideration and it is important for the Committee to give them proper scrutiny. The last thing that we want is to give the impression that the Bill was rushed through, because that would give scope to others to shoot it down in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to meet on Wednesdays and support the motion because we are committed to measures to protect hedgerows. Hon. Members will recall that, following extensive consultation, in July 1991 we announced new proposals to protect hedgerows. They involved, first, a hedgerow notification scheme and, secondly, a centrally funded hedgerow management grant scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October 1991, a report commissioned by my Department, which has already been mentioned, cited neglect as one of the main causes of hedgerow loss. We pressed ahead with our scheme to develop the better management of hedgerows. The hedgerow incentive scheme was launched in July 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to say that in its first year of operation, restoration agreements have been offered to more than 450 farmers and, as a result, more than 400 miles of valuable English hedgerows will be restored to their former glory. That is a tribute to the Countryside Commission, which administers the scheme, and to the farming community, which responded so enthusiastically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is necessary to tackle the problem of hedgerow removal. Although most hedgerows are lost through neglect, some are removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be brief and I shall respond later, if I am called, to the amendments proposed by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should be acceptable to all concerned—landowning groups and environmentalists. I should like to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown). The best environmentalists that I have met have been landowners who are properly taking care of their land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight that there is a conflict between the two groups or that there are two camps. When I was at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I dealt with food—I was a pale imitation of the present
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Minister. I do not, therefore, have a foot in both camps. My hon. Friend told me that his hedge is a privet and he suggested that one would be straddling hedges. The hedgerows in my constituency and around my small patch of land are hawthorn and blackthorn. I shall be planting much more and have no intention of trying to straddle them. That is why I welcome the amendments on creating a gap in a hedge for proper access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is important that we meet on a Wednesday because this is a good, rounded Bill which, in simple terms, would require notification of intention to destroy or damage a hedgerow and would empower local authorities to prevent destruction of hedgerows of value. That would be subject to an appeals mechanism, which my hon. Friend has considered and developed. In a simple way, the most valuable and important hedgerows in our countryside would be protected. At the same time, the Bill would endeavour to ensure that there would be minimum disruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to complete my remarks and not to detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would endeavour to ensure that farmers and landowners would have the minimum hassle in using the notification procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the Bill is that it would not prevent the removal of all hedgerows. It is not its purpose to freeze the countryside in aspic and allow no change. To do so, would be impractical and, in the Government's view, unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to making minor contributions in the Committee by putting the Government's view. I have taken on board what the hon. Member for Wentworth said last week and today. I hope to be able to respond to his amendments and I commend the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I hope that I made it clear that were are farmers on the Isle of Wight who are third, fourth, fifth and sixth generation. Therefore, I want to hear no criticism of landowners tending our heritage in the countryside. On reflection, when he reads the record of our debate, the Minister will realise that he took me slightly amiss when he suggested that I thought that there was a conflict between landowning and preserving the countryside. My concern is with the vandals who are elected to county halls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say that I own no hedgerow. Indeed, few of my constituents own hedgerows. I suspect that my constituency has fewer hedgerows than most. Having said that, owners of hedgerows are not the only people who are concerned about what happens to them. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) referred somewhat scornfully to the interest in them of the hon. Member for Battersea. The people of Battersea, in common with those in Islington, know that three quarters of British lowland mammals, three quarters of British birds and half of British butterflies breed in hedges. Hedges provide a rich part of our national heritage and are important to the entire population, whether they own them or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what the hon. Gentleman is saying and agree with him. Within London's boundaries there are hedgerows that would be protected by the Bill. As for common land, there are hedgerows on Wimbledon common, in my borough, and on golf courses and in parks—I presume that the Bill applies to Royal parks—such as those in Richmond park, which would be protected. London Members have as close a personal constituency interest in putting the Bill on the statute book as any hon. Member who represents rural interests. I am married to a rural interest: a farmer's daughter—perhaps I should declare that. We all support the Bill, regardless of whether we have privet hedges around our personal domains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. He will be aware, of course, that the Bill covers a hedgerow on Wimbledon common but not one adjacent to Wimbledon common. That is a matter which might be discussed later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to withdraw the word "scornfully" now that he has heard about the considerable pedigree and interest in hedgerows of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My description referred to the tone of voice and the language used by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, not at all to the entirely honourable interests which the hon. Member for Battersea has in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with the specifics of the amendment, a general point must be made about the acceleration in the rate of loss of hedgerows in recent years. During the past six years, about 7,200 miles of hedgerow have been grubbed up every year—that is a rate of 20 miles of hedgerow per day. If disintegration of hedgerows through neglect is included—my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) will refer to that when we consider later amendments—the net loss amounts to about 12,500 miles per year after taking account of new planting. That means that almost 10 per cent. of hedgerow cover in England and Wales disappears every year. As legislators we must be concerned about that because hedgerows are such important features of our landscape and wildlife habitats. The purpose of the Bill is justifiably and rightly to provide additional protection for hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments explores why it is not possible to extend the scope of the Bill to cover hedgerows which are not included in its provisions. The Bill excludes small hedges of less than 20 m, and none of us has any argument with that Clause 1(2) states that a hedgerow will be protected only if it
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) is on or adjacent to land used for agriculture or forestry"—</p></blockquote>
that presumably means that it is currently used for agriculture or forestry—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) is on common land, protected land or a golf-course or racecourse."</p></blockquote>
It is obviously important to protect such locations, but hedges in a multitude of other locations are equally important. One of the most important is urban areas. There may be no agriculture or forestry use and no adjacent common land or golf course, but none the less, hedges may be of value. I shall identify one or two of the hedges that fall outside the scope of the Bill but which should be covered, and I am grateful to the Royal Society for Nature Conservation for providing the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Fryent park in the borough of Brent in London there are about 10 km of hedgerow. Much of the pattern has changed little from the parish maps of 1597 and they contain the nationally rare narrow-leaved bittercress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Leicester there are hedgerows composed of hawthorn, dog rose, sycamore, elm, blackthorn, crack willow, elder, holly and field maple. They are south of the adventure playground at Western park. Also in Leicester there is hedgerow bordering a cycle way on a disused railway line where the adjacent land is unmanaged open space and disused allotments. There are other hedgerows within and surrounding a disused sports field north of Dorset avenue, Eyres Monsell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Peterborough there is ancient hedge in Longthorpe, one of the older parts of the city and close to the city centre, which contains woodland plants, including dog's mercury. It is adjacent to a school playing field and housing estate. Also in Peterborough there is a mixed hedge in South Bretton alongside a footpath on a housing estate. It was part of the original old parkland and maintains a link with past landscapes. It includes mature oak, hawthorn, field maple and rose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Plymouth, there are important hedgerows on Estover industrial estate containing a rare shrub that is known as the Plymouth Pear, which is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In Leeds, massive hedgerows exist surrounded by houses and factories at Sugarwell hill, only a mile from the city centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Birmingham, in Woodgate valley country park, hedgerows adjoin managed areas in the park adjacent to public open space, playing fields and housing. By the river Cole, hedges border public open space, allotments and playing fields. In Walsall, diverse hedges border a disused

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
railway at New Invention. They are adjacent to housing, gardens and public open space. In Wolverhampton, hedges border a disused railway in Valley Park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are examples of extremely important hedgerows in urban settings that are not covered by the Bill. Amendment No. 6, which I am happy to join the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury in supporting, simply asks why protection should be restricted to hedgerows in the specific locations identified in clause 1(2). The Bill should cover hedgerows in urban areas that are not on common land and should protect some of the important hedgerows to which I have alluded. I hope that the Committee will accept amendments Nos. 6 and 49 because they would provide extra protection for hedgerows that will otherwise be unprotected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by declaring my interests. I am a chartered surveyor and a member of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the National Trust, the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association. I am a farmer. I have seen a net gain of more than one mile of hedge on my farm and I have planted more than 100,000 trees. Therefore, let no one say that I am not concerned with the environment. I also grew up on a farm and have been involved with hedgerows all my life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking to amendments Nos. 49 and 6, I wish to comment on some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. It is slightly facile to argue about how many miles of hedgerow have been removed, but I should correct one major factual error that he made. It is generally accepted by the report of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology that about 12,000 miles of hedgerow have been removed during the past ten years; not every year, as he stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 is very important. As I said in my opening remarks on the sittings motion, the Bill should conform to the rules of natural justice and should be fair. It is inequitable to exclude those hedges in urban areas that would otherwise be included in the Bill. Why should some citizens be covered by the Bill and others not? That is inequitable and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will argue that the additional administration involved in notifying urban local authorities of every hedge within the scope of the Bill would be excessively bureaucratic and difficult to enforce. My answer to that would be that local authorities do not have to act. They are not obliged to act, although they may act. It is reasonable, therefore, that all hedgerows—wherever they are in the country—should be covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has remarked that to some extent, urban hedges are protected by the Bill—those hedges that are covered by the Commons Registration Act 1965. Such hedges are adjacent to golf courses and horse establishments. However, a substantial number of urban hedges are not covered by the Bill. In fairness to all citizens of this country, therefore amendment No. 6 should be carefully considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In 1987, as a member of the council of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, I attended the centenary of that organisation at Kings' Cross station where, to mark the occasion, a railway engine was to be named Avocet.

The guest speaker was none other than Lady Thatcher. My hopes were raised and I was delighted and heartened when in her encouraging speech, she called on villagers to accept their role as custodians of our natural heritage and specified a number of urgent needs, one of which was the need to protect hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lady Thatcher announced to that distinguished gathering that 130,000 miles of hedgerow had been removed from Britain in the previous four decades and she called on Britain to protect the hedgerows. I did not stay for the lunch because I was on my way to the House to introduce my Hedgerows Bill. That Bill was sponsored by hon. Members on both sides of the House. That is not the case with this Bill, but I do not want to make a fuss about that weakness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Bill had commendable and varied support and included amendments to meet the requirements of the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was to be read some time the following Friday, but I discovered that, on orders from No. 10 Downing street, the Government Whips were to block its progress. Acrimonious correspondence took place between the then Prime Minister and I. She was prepared to say highly acceptable words to the conservation lobby when it gathered but she did not have consistency of purpose. I am delighted, therefore, to see this change. Six years and, at least, 30,000 miles of ex-hedgerow later, I am delighted that the Government are prepared to accept the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury mentioned that he has planted hedgerows. I welcome that and I am glad to see new hedgerows appearing. However, it will probably take many decades, if not centuries, for those hedgerows to reach the ecological value of the ancient hedgerows which have been removed, frequently irresponsibly, in past years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new hedgerow is better than nothing, but it cannot automatically replace the ecological loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
History will probably record that our approach to the hedgerow and the environment has been feckless. As a land surveyor the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is better equipped than I am to make the calculation, but people may think, and I accept it, that had there not been such massive hedgerow loss, there would have been a curb in food production. However, had those hedgerows not been destroyed, it could be argued that we would not be worried about food surpluses, set-aside or the gross over-production of food in Britain under the terms of EC agricultural policy. Thousands of miles of hedgerow may have been removed foolishly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must change the balance and endorse the sensible approach of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. Many farmers, including some friends of mine, have adopted that approach but have then seen their neighbours act with complete disregard to the future. A farmer with no eye to the future is not typical of farmers in British history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his great knowledge of the history of hedgerows, will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how many miles of the hedgerows that have been removed were ancient hedgerows and how many miles would have been planted by our great grandfathers and great great grandfathers during the previous two centuries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Land that was enclosed from commons in previous centuries contains the hedgerows of most ecological value. The most valuable hedgerows are those which are farm boundaries, field boundaries of former common land or next to highways, footpaths and bridleways, many of which are of considerable antiquity. They represent the skeleton of ecological value. That is a generalisation, but many thousands of miles of hedgerows are of considerable antiquity and in the past 30 or 40 years many miles of such hedgerows have unfortunately been removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman agree that before our great grandfathers and great great grandfathers planted those hedges during the previous couple of centuries, the English and Welsh landscape was largely unenclosed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Enclosures were not restricted to the middle 18th and early 19th centuries. Many of the 4,000 Acts of Enclosure were made during that period, but enclosure started a long time before that. The pace of enclosure was dictated by the rise in the population during the industrial revolution, which required an increase in food production and enclosure of common land. Common land before the industrial revolution may not have had so much hedgerow, but it was covered by scrub and natural vegetation and that ecological inheritance has passed down to our generation. We are now seeing the obliteration of many miles of essential ecological habitat, which in many areas depresses the landscape so that it is featureless and provides none of the inspiration that it traditionally provided for art and literature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Bill to protect that inheritance and I am resistant to amendments that may weaken the Bill. I strongly support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and trust that the Committee will accept the amendment with dispatch and ensure that the Bill is of the quality that Britain needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sympathetic to the amendments and I hope that they will be taken seriously by the hon. Member for Surrey, East and the Minister. However, there is a major problem of definition. Our approach to amendments is bound to be determined to some extent by definition, so I must define Cornish banks. I am referring not to the sort of bank that refuses to extend our overdrafts, but to the form of boundary that has been common for centuries in Cornwall. Those who have visited Cornwall know that they are an important feature of the local environment. The hedge to which I referred during my brief intervention on the sittings motion is partly Cornish bank and partly Cornish bank with a hedge on top. Hon. Members who have visited Cornwall in recent years may have seen new Cornish banks being constructed along improved roads. Cornish banks are stone based with a strip towards the top and two juxtaposed slate-like stones. Those stones are referred to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
as Jack and Joan because those are the common names of the Cornish man and woman and are slightly at cross-purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turfing is put at the very top of the hedge—that is a Cornish bank. As the hon. Member for Wentworth said, extensive vegetation might grow on top of that bank in time. Approximately 25 ft of the boundary to my property in Cornwall is a hedge as defined under the hedgerow incentive scheme because it has an extra 4 ft or 5 ft on top. Should I be so disposed, I could apply for assistance to protect that part of my boundary. However, the remaining 45 ft or 50 ft of my boundary is simply a Cornish bank, with no vegetation on top. Daffodils grow there at this time of year—spring comes early to Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I do not wish to interrupt the flow of the hon. Member for North Cornwall but my amendments to clause 15 deal with the issue at length. I wonder whether it is in order to discuss the issue under amendment No. 49.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My vote on amendment No. 49 might depend on the interpretation of a hedgerow. The amendment, which applies to non-agricultural land, would be important to several Cornish towns. Often in recent years the expansion of towns has taken in ancient field lines, including Cornish banks, some of which had vegetation on top. Therefore, I submit that we cannot dispose of the question of definition in later consideration of the Bill. It must be considered now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The carrot of the hedgerow incentive scheme and the potential stick of the Bill should march side by side—they cannot have different definitions. There is a problem in the incentive scheme, about which I have had long and cheerful, but not very satisfactory correspondence with the Countryside Commission, the Cornwall Rural Community Council, the Institute of Cornish Studies and other important authoritative organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cornwall Rural Community Council told me that Cornish hedges are being excluded from grant-aided hedgerow incentive schemes because they are "non-living". Grass on their tops is not considered sufficient. The Department of the Environment—and I am sure that the Minister will respond to this—does not regard grass on the top as a "hedge", but as a "non-living" bank. If non-living banks are to be excluded under the Bill, there is a large lacuna in the centre of our consideration. The Countryside Commission endorses that interpretation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Hedgerow Incentive Scheme is rather different."</p></blockquote>
It is different from the countryside stewardship scheme, which takes Cornish banks into account and pays careful attention to the character of boundaries in Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hargreaves 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall, Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about Cornish banks, but does he accept that his remarks apply also to similar banks, perhaps slightly differently constructed, of the same height which are of as much interest to those concerned with the rural environment of Devon and west Somerset? Other banks may be constructed differently, but their height and value to flora and fauna, the little animals, creatures and birds that five in them, is the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. With my Cornish ancestry, I can be dragged out of order only too easily to discuss the successful colonisation of parts of Devon and Somerset by my ancestors. It was at that time that the Cornish bank spread into other parts of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point, in its letter, the Countryside Commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here we have a specific Government remit which is to address a progressive decline in the quality of England's hedgerows as a consequence of inappropriate forms of management"</p></blockquote>
The banks are traditionally found in Cornwall. They are substantial. They are found in England, Devon and Somerset, but are primarily a Celtic and Cornish phenomenon. The Countryside Commission's letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have included hedge banks such as those found in Devon, but stone walls and Cornish hedgerows are outside our remit for this scheme.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Even if we are unable to satisfy your case for extending the scope of the Hedgerow Incentive Scheme to include Cornish hedges, I hope that I have at least allayed your concerns that the Countryside Commission has a prejudice against the Cornish landscape."</p></blockquote>
However, in further correspondence, when I asked the Countryside Commission to which Ministers we should make representations, I was given the following advice:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have found it surprisingly difficult to define a 'hedge' but all are agreed that for the purposes of this scheme"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the incentive scheme—
	<br><blockquote><p>"its primary characteristic is a line of growing trees or shrubs. This means that walls fall outside the scope of the scheme."</p></blockquote>
When I pressed the Commission on the question of to whom we should make representations, the answer was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Maclean and Mr. Gummer."</p></blockquote>
So it is a great pleasure to see the Minister in Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A serious point of definition has been raised. If the habitats of many species will be excluded from the Bill, in the way that they were excluded from the incentive scheme, that will be a serious weakness in the legislation; a weakness that runs through every clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are valuable for the reasons that I have already described. They would apply to the banks of small towns in Cornwall and also to major cities, such as Plymouth, to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred. There, too, the indigenous hedge is based on the Cornish bank—a solid, permanent feature of the landscape. It would be a shame if the Bill were weakened by a lack of comprehension of the different indigenous forms of boundary. For those reasons, therefore, I cannot support the amendment until I hear from the promoter of the Bill and from the Minister whether they believe that the definition can be extended to cover Cornish banks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight that the Committee needs to sit both day and night for a week to consider the legislation. We have heard the colonial confessions of the hon. Member for North Cornwall. He made some interesting points about Cornwall, which I know well because I had an aunt who lived there. She lived in a house near a church, which was all that the village comprised, the rest of the village having disappeared. Around it were banks, which had outlived mankind. The banks are, therefore, solid and lasting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
When dealing with a private Member's Bill, one can tackle many subjects at a time and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East is probably wise to limit his to hedgerows. As he said, once the debate is widened we start to discuss other matters such as banks. I think of the smugglers' ways that were dug into the ground in the Sussex downs and other formations, natural and man made, which could be considered. My hon. Friend mentioned stone walls and another Bill might be needed to protect the stone walls of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency that probably has the highest number of stone walls in the country, and the cost of maintaining them has become prohibitive for farmers. If we are to discuss the protection of stone walls, a substantial amount of public money will be needed because it would be inequitable for farmers or owners of land where there were stone walls to have that included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By refusing to accept the amendment on the ground that it does not include stone walls, the hon. Member for North Cornwall is expressing an unfortunate view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may come to the rescue of the hon. Member for North Cornwall, I do not think that he said that he will oppose the amendment He is waiting to hear the response to it, so there is time for persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is correct: this is not the stone walls Bill. It may be stonewalled in parts, but let us concentrate on hedgerows because we shall do the nation a service if we enact the Bill. Perhaps another Bill is required to deal with some of the other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an interesting exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and the hon. Member for Wentworth. Is Wentworth a golf course?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that southern minds may associate Wentworth with a golf course where the wealthy indulge themselves, but the Wentworth that I represent is a relative small village of considerable antiquity. The constituency existed before 1950 and I am pleased that it retains its old name. It is a real place where real people face real problems and I am delighted that people will eventually realise that that reality should take precedence over the artificiality of areas slightly to the west of this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another episode for the gazetteer, but the hon. Member for Wentworth is right. Wentworth is hedged about with history, so it is within the terms of the Bill in every sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earlier discussion was about the history of hedges and we could spend many happy hours discussing where hedges originated, which are ancient, which resulted from the enclosures and which are more recent. All have a place in our landscape and heritage in different ways and some may need greater protection than others. Those of us who support the Bill want to protect that history and heritage in a sensible way and that is why we must make a careful examination of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to my wife's farming background and the fields on her family's farms date back to quite ancient times and the hedges go with them. Hedges should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
protected wherever possible because, as any farmer knows, they afford great protection from winds and their removal can cause damage to the interests of farmers and many others. We are becoming increasingly aware of their importance to wildlife, their flora and fauna and the banks beneath them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the amendments would alter the clause in different ways. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury sought to remove clause 1(2) and put nothing in its place. As I understand it, he has tabled no amendments to replace clause 1(2). My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East seeks, with amendment No. 7, to re-write clause 1(2). The wording of that amendment strikes me as similar to the existing wording, with some additional wording at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully and with some sympathy to the powerful case made by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury for the protection of urban hedgerows, many of which were rural in their time. The towns have taken over. There is a case for inserting a provision in the Bill to give the urban hedgerows some protection. There is all the difference in the world between adding to the definition and removing the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's questioning of "land used for agriculture" in clause 2(1)(a). Does that include land that is set aside? Does it include land that was formally used for agriculture? Although it does not occur so much now there has been a tradition of villages expanding into farmland Often when that occurs any farm wall or walled garden is protected, but hedges are not necessarily protected. The present wording would appear not to take that risk into account. Perhaps a word such as "normally", "formally" or "recently" needs to be inserted between "land" and "used". That is not a reason for removing clause 1(2)(a) entirely. In clause 1(2)(b), the problem is the condition that the hedgerow is on or adjacent to agricultural land but only on common land. Perhaps we need to examine that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to explore whether something specific needs to be incorporated in respect of ancient hedges. I am not wholly convinced, although I want to protect ancient hedges. My hon. Friend and the Minister might give us some clues on where the wording might leave us if it were left as it is or, alternatively, if it were not included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key is to ensure that we have a sensible regime for the protection of our hedgerows. If we remove all exclusions, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury wishes to do, every bit of scrub on derelict land and wasteland might automatically be protected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that the 20 m provision will still apply even if the amendments are made, which I suspect would cater for virtually all the objections he might make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. The hon. Gentleman is into his metrication, which is a little beyond me, in the same way that he was into kilometres earlier. I tried to work out if 10 km was a lot or a little. He is right to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that point, but my point is not specific. There will be cases in which 20 m or whatever of hedgerow as defined might be undesirable or not as desirable to protect in the same way as we wish to protect most of our hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not special pleading? It is inequitable that some hedges should be included and some should not i am sure that the hon. Gentleman, in welcoming the principle of the Bill, would welcome the inclusion of urban or rural hedges in the Bill. It would be equitable to include them all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am special pleading, I am only doing so in the same way as my hon. Friend. I am arguing with him against the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, who wishes to remove clause 1(2) and put nothing in its place. My hon. Friend wants to replace clause 1(2) with something different. On balance, I prefer that the clause is expanded to meet the requirements necessary for urban hedgerows, instead of the provision being removed. As a result, all hedgerows will be protected, irrespective of their worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is neater than what I shall attempt to do with amendments Nos. 3 and 4, which we shall discuss later. It would protect the hedgerows in a substantial area in my constituency. That is the main reason why I support it. Having listened to the Committee, I wish to make a strong recommendation to the Bill's promoter. The more simple that the hon. Member for Surrey, East can make the Bill, the less likelihood of it being killed on Report by so-called supporters who take a long time to discuss it. If he wants to make progress, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman simplifies the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Bill to apply to my constituency, which is on the edges of greater Manchester between Stockport and Tameside. Its central feature is the river Tame. Originally, there was good agricultural land on either side of the river, but now almost all of that land has houses on it. The only open space that is left is the river valley. That land has never been good agricultural land as it is subject to flooding. The farms that remain on the edge of the valley have lost their best land to housing, and the land at the valley bottom is not a viable proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few people have lingered in the valley. Some have occupations such as milk rounds, while others have adapted farm buildings to kennels, where people leave their pets when they go on holiday. Various other establishments, such as riding schools, are also in the area. Some of the valley land is part of a golf course, while other parts are still farmed Much of the land, however, is not directly looked after by farmers and would not be covered by the Bill in its current form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are substantial old hedgerows in the area. Regretably, they are neglected and are becoming lines of hawthorn trees. They do not provide the same habitat attractions as they used to do. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, such hedgerows do not have much of a bottom to them. Having said that, I should still like them protected. One of the neatest ways in which to do that would be remove subsection (2) and, thus, ensure that all hedges are covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The Bill refers to golf courses. Within the valley area that I have been describing is a driving range—I am not sure whether that counts as a golf course. There are many similar problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Sunday, I walked for about an hour by a canal that is fairly close to my constituency. When it was built, it had hawthorn hedges on both sides. Those hedgerows are still attractive, although not well-maintained. Houses have been built on a short stretch of land that goes down to the canal. A few individuals have decided to take up part of the hawthorn hedge so that they have good views of the canal from their houses. I do not blame them for that, as their houses were designed with large windows. It then dawned on them that all those walking along the towpath or boating on the canal would be able to see them eating their Sunday lunches and so on. Instead of re-planting the hawthorn hedge, of which I would have approved, those house owners have erected panels of wood. Now along the canal is a lovely hawthorn hedge that is split into bits by sets of wooden panels at the bottom of people's gardens. I consider that to be vandalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Bill to protect hedges that run along many railways and canals. By trying to define the conditions in terms of
	<br><blockquote><p>"agriculture or forestry … common land, protected land or a golf-course or racecourse"</p></blockquote>
the hon. Member for Surrey, East has to produce an almost endless list if he is to achieve his objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The neat amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, which would remove the qualifications in subsection (2), would be useful and would mean that the proposals for the protection of hedgerows would apply to many areas in my constituency and to other places where it is important to maintain the quality of the countryside. We have fewer and fewer caring farmers, from whom the hon. Member for Surrey, East rightly drew evidence, to protect the countryside. Therefore, the Bill's provisions are even more necessary in areas where there is a danger of neglect than in those where someone makes a good living from the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the points already made, I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East to consider a saying that the Navy has: "Understanding weakens resolve". As hon. Members have pointedly said, simplicity is the key note. You, Mr. Hill, will have noted my eloquence and power of speech as I have already recruited my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea to my view of the sittings motion. By the time that we have completed our deliberations, practically every member of the Committee will be of like mind to myself and will agree that we should have sat all week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and the hon. Member for Islington, South
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
and Finsbury rightly mentioned the hedges that are within two boundaries. My wife was a beekeeper for some years, even though I have never liked the little blighters. As soon as I got near the hive, they used to rush out in swarms and sting me. I do not mind honey on my toast at breakfast, but I cannot take to the little creatures. Eventually, the bees mistook my wife for me and she was stung so badly that she gave up bee keeping However, if one talks to a bee keeper, he will say that the bees give a much greater yield in a town environment than in a rural one. The hon. Friend for Islington, South and Finsbury was right to draw our attention to the habitats that hedgerows provide for a vast variety of wildlife. They provide it in the countryside, and in the towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the forbearance of the Committee, I shall quote a letter that I have received from Michael Ball. As I have said, he is the parliamentary National Farmers Union branch liaison officer, and he is the chairman of my regional area. He refers to planning regulation, which is germane to the issues that we are considering. To paraphrase his letter, he points out that farmers on the Isle of Wight and in the southern region asked him to make representations on the Bill because it offends against natural justice in that it circumscribes farm hedges more than others in semi-rural areas. We shall discuss that in due course. The points are made that the appeals procedure is unreasonable and far too difficult, woolly and open to subjective determination, and that loose terms such as "proper management" and "impairing quality" are open to extensive litigation and recourse to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final two paragraphs of the letter are the ones that are particularly germane to the clause. Mr. Ball states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the whole history of planning law stems from an urban background and is interpreted mainly in an urban commitment by those who do not make a living on the land."</p></blockquote>
He asked that I make strong representations about the Bill. There is no reason why it should discriminate against hedges in the countryside as opposed to those in towns, as hon. Members have already eloquently stated. There is every reason to suggest that all hedges should be dealt with by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's valid point about discriminating between urban and rural attitudes. Perhaps he will take the opportunity to correct what may have been a misrepresentation. He said—I am not sure whether this would be dealt with by the amendment or by other parts of the Bill—that Standen heath was to be used as a waste disposal site and that a hedgerow was in danger of being removed at the county council's instigation. His information is out of date. The plans have been modified. Will he comment on the fact that while the Isle of Wight county council and South Wight district council support a hedgerow protection scheme with funds, Medina district council, which has sadly fallen under Conservative control, has withdrawn funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You would immediately rule me out of order, Mr. Hill, if I were to become involved in that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of waste disposal on the island will ensure that the Liberal Democrats' sticky grasp on power over

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
county council affairs will be ended on 6 May. I am not surprised to hear from the hon. Member for North Cornwall that his relatives crept out of Cornwall into Devon and Somerset. With a reputation such as his, I am not surprised that they needed to leave a neighbourhood quickly. The change of mind by the Isle of Wight county council to which he alluded occurred because of a vigorous campaign fought by myself and the Conservative opposition on the council against vandalism by the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall immediately return to discussing it, Mr. Hill. I know that you want me to stay in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will take advice on whether it is possible to extend the Bill in the way that is proposed. I am certain that, given his interest in hedgerows, he would want to ensure that hedgerows everywhere should be protected, if possible. My hon. Friend is a reasonable, fair-minded and open-minded Member of Parliament. He will give every consideration to the points that have been put to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say that I did not intend to speak about the amendment, but the hon. Member for North Cornwall discussed the hedgerow incentive scheme and it is important that I respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the Bill that earth banks with hedgerows on top are included in clause 15(3). That clause makes a point of singling them out. I am surprised that there has been any discussion about the hedgerow incentive scheme because they are certainly covered by it. The booklet which the Countryside Commission—one of the agencies reporting to my Department—has issued makes special mention of the rates of grant. The rates are: for the restoration of earth banks, £3 a metre; for the minor restoration of stone-faced banks, £10 a metre and, for the major restoration of stone-faced banks, £25 a metre. The hedgerow incentive scheme is open to all those with hedgerows, not only farmers or those with a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food farmholding number, but it is a qualitative scheme. If a farmer who applies for a MAFF grant satisfies the basic criteria, that grant is paid automatically. The hedgerow incentive scheme does not necessarily lead to payment being made to everyone who applies, or everyone with an earth bank with a hedge on top. The Countryside Commission has the flexibility and the right to decide which banks are the most important. It cannot fund every scheme, so it makes a qualitative judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country stewardship scheme is much wider. It is not solely concerned with hedgerows and may fund dry stone walls or an earth bank that has nothing growing on top of it apart from grass. The hedgerow incentive scheme should—if the right judgments are made—fund only earth banks with a living hedgerow on top. Admittedly, that could include a straggly living hedgerow that needs to be improved, repaired and have its gaps filled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the question of the degree of vegetation on the top of a traditional Cornish bank that has caused the concern. I understand precisely the Minister's
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
comments about the parallel stewardship scheme, which is valuable and welcome, as is the incentive scheme. There have been major problems of definition, and it would be a great tragedy if the Bill, which is worthwhile, were to be subject to the same lack of definition with regard to the traditional and historic Cornish bank. Does the Minister agree that we should consider the matter further and debate it again when we come to the definitions in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we shall return to that matter. I accept that the definition of a hedgerow is not clear cut. We can all recognise a good, thriving, bushy hedge when we see one, and a lump of earth from which a hedgerow has been removed. The difficulty comes in deciding on straggly, stumpy bits of hedgerow trees that have not been cut, pruned or coppiced for many years and are not quite a full hedgerow. We intend to produce guidance on the management and styles of hedgerows that will encompass all of the styles throughout the country. That booklet of guidance will also deal with other potential problems of the Bill, such as where one hedgerow joins another and whether, when a hedgerow joins a building, it is still a hedgerow. The booklet should deal with the definitional problems that many of us are aware of, such as when half a dozen bushes qualify as a hedgerow. That is a qualitative judgment However, there are experts who can make such judgments. If the Bill is passed, the guidance that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will issue will cover these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that when I heard that my hon. Friend for Surrey, East intended to present the Bill, my instinctive reaction was to think that it should cover all hedgerows, I began from the same starting point as he: I did not want the Bill to be perceived as town dwellers yet again telling country dwellers: "You will look after your hedgerows. We are telling you to do something that will not apply to us." I felt strongly about that, because it is a matter of perception and of natural justice. However, when I examined the drafting more closely, I concluded regretfully that it would be impractical to follow that route. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will deal with the point in his winding-up speech. I merely point out that many hedgerows in urban environments where there is to be development will be caught under existing planning legislation. Although I was entirely sympathetic to the general principle, I concluded that it would not be practical in reality. It could include millions of other hedgerows, which would put an intolerable burden on local planning authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In making my initial contribution to the Committee, I should like to join those who have welcomed you, Mr. Hill, to the Chair, and say how much I appreciate your being there.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As reference has been made to the fact that hon. Members are serving on the Committee on a voluntary basis, I wish to thank all those who are present. They give the impression that they are by no means unwilling volunteers, to judge from the quality and duration of some of the speeches that we have so far heard.

Many points have been raised, and I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not reply to each one. I

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
am well aware that there are those who want the scope of the Bill widened to protect hedgerows in urban and suburban areas. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the matter has been discussed at considerable length.I know that there are valuable hedges in such areas. However, we must recognise the practical problem that is posed by the sheer number of hedgerows in England and Wales. We must always consider the costs and bureaucracy that new legislation will entail.

I have produced a Bill which, I hope, achieves a sensible balance. Its scope is not unduly restricted to land use for agriculture, but is not too wide and, although well intentioned, too expensive and complex to administer. We shall later discuss specific cases, but at the outset I want to register the fact that I have carefully considered how far the Bill should extend control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened closely to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, especially to his comments on Fryent park. I am sympathetic to his case, but the problem is that if the Bill were to be extended, as he and his hon. Friends suggest, it would cover many thousands of hedgerows which we do not seek to protect and which, by any objective criteria, are not worth protecting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can say that many bits of urban hedgerows are not worth protecting, while at the same time he proposes to put a burden on the rest of the population who happen to have hedgerows or look after hedgerows. That is an untenable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, perhaps, almost as untenable as opposing the principles of the Bill and then seeking to extend its scope, which I find to be a curious paradox in my hon. Friend's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an unworthy remark. It is not my intention to oppose the Bill. If I had wanted to do so, I would have opposed it at an earlier stage. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw that thoroughly unworthy remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to withdraw any remark that caused offence to my hon. Friend. He knows as well as I that he has raised with me major issues of concern. I have been happy to discuss them with him, and no doubt we shall discuss them again later in our proceedings. He raised the important point about the burden that the Bill would place on the rural community, and I am sure that we shall have a lively debate on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would protect only the most valuable hedges in England and Wales. In ensuring that particularly valuable examples are retained, I do not wish to burden unduly landowners or those who administer the controls—in this case, the local authorities. Therefore, I am most keen to ensure that hedgerows that are not of value do not clog up the administration of the controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the most valuable hedges. Is he really saying that a hedgerow between two fields in the middle of Gloucestershire, for example, to which no member of the public has legal access is more Valuable than a hedgerow in my
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
constituency past which hundreds of young children run and in which they can observe wildlife? I should have thought that protecting the wildlife in an urban area was just as important as protecting it in the countryside. Indeed, it is perhaps more important because more people can enjoy it and so learn to conserve and protect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said already that I am most sympathetic to the points made by Oppsition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should explain what administrative burden will be placed on local authorities. If they consider the hedgerow to be unimportant, they need take no action. The Bill puts them under no obligation to do anything. By extending the Bill's scope, they need take action only when they consider it prudent and worthwhile to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the many hundreds of thousands, and probably millions, of hedges that would be brought into the potential scope of the Bill by an extension such as the amendment suggests, it is realistic to assume that many applications, queries and inquiries would go to town halls in urban areas throughout the country. I fear that the burden that that would impose on those administering the measure would be too great and that the costs would be excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to keep the Bill as simple and straightforward as possible. The hon. Member for Devon, North—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is the hon. Member for Cornwall, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His relations live in Devon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on the temporary relationship between Devon, North and Cornwall, North. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North made the critical point that the Bill should be simple and efficient in its operation. It is with that in mind that I am responding to points raised by hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between rural and urban hedgerows is that rural hedgerows are part of the landscape, which urban hedgerows are not. Those of us who are anxious about urban hedgerows want to protect particular urban hedgerows with particular histories and qualities. I wonder whether such protection might be more appropriate in other legislation. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will consider a measure similar to the tree preservation orders in urban areas. Local authorities could at least be invited to consider a fisting process for the hedgerows identified by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury so that they, in particular, could have the security for the future that we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and agree that there may well be a case for re-examining the legislation that covers the issue. I should say in response to my hon. Friend's comments, and to the sensitive comments of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made the important point that urban local authorities already have to administer tree preservation orders, which they do satisfactorily. Is there any reason why they should not also be able to administer hedgerows under this measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I have dealt with that point at some length. I dare say that there will be an opportunity to come back to it, but the Committee has now been discussing it for some time. I am sorry that I do not seem to have succeeded so far in persuading my hon. Friend of the difficulties involved, or of the extent of planning legislation that already exists to deal with the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the public concern about the disappearance of Britain's hedgerows is, I feel, very much to do with hedgerows in the countryside—the disappearance of those hedgerows that make the lattice-like pattern that we all understand and that is so characteristic of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the catalysts for the Bill was the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology report on hedgerows in the countryside which has already been referred to. The alarming figures that the institute produced have been alluded to. There has been some dispute among hon. Members about the exact figures and I may be able to set the matter straight. The survey carried out by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology—conducted, as my hon. Friend the Minister will know, as part of the Department of the Environment's countryside survey—showed that between 1984 and 1990 a net loss of just over 103,000 km of hedgerow occurred in England and Wales. I apologise to the Committee for speaking in a foreign language when dealing with the numbers. I hope that hon. Members will be able to translate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope and believe that Committee members all agree that the figure of 103,000 km is too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where my hon. Friend gets his information. I have the document produced by the Council for the Protection of Rural England. That body is probably fairly sympathetic to my hon. Friend's aims. It says, summarising the report by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, that between 1984 and 1990 12,400 miles, net, of hedgerow, were removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had my hon. Friend allowed me to complete my remarks, I would have gone on to say that the figures that I gave were for the total loss. We are of course dealing in Committee with the loss owing to removal. I have conducted my own scrutiny of the figures produced by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and translated them into English. In broad terms we are concerned with about 16,000 miles of hedgerow that were removed over that period—around 2,000 miles a year on average I believe that those figures are as accurate as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman correctly gave the figure from the ITE for the six years between 1984 and 1990 as 103,000 km net overall lost through grubbing up and neglect. That works out at the figure of 12,500 miles per year that I gave earlier in the debate. There is, however, a dispute about how much is actually removed.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The Royal Society for Nature Conservation said that 7,200 miles of hedgerow was grubbed up each year during the six-year period. The hon. Gentleman said that it was 2,000 miles—which is, in any event, too much—but I suspect that the figure may be higher than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He makes the essential point that whatever figure is absolutely correct—and I suspect that we may not be able to establish it—the range of figures that has been produced by creditable organisations, which have devoted time and care to studying the problems, suggests that the problem is on a large, unsatisfactory and unacceptable scale. It is that which the Bill seeks to rectify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the wider issues that have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. As most of the land in the countryside on which hedgerow loss occurs is agricultural, controls will inevitably affect farmers. I hope that the Committee will accept that I am not a farmer basher. I am most sympathetic to the farming community, which currently faces economic difficulties. Farmers have been stewards of the countryside for centuries: we owe to them the present shape of the countryside in many of its forms, most of which are desirable. That point was comprehended in drafting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been debate on this subject for many years. The hon. Member for Wentworth has been raising issues to do with hedgerow loss over a long period and I pay tribute to his tenacity. However, the issue pre-dates even the hon. Gentleman's sojourn in the House. As long ago as 966, reference was made to a hedgerow being removed at Grimley in Worcestershire. Much more recently, in 1792, hedgerow loss was discussed in the House. The House of Commons Journal of the time produced an interesting report which strikes a modern chord. It says in one paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The grubbing up of hedgerows is becoming general and the growth of timber in them is thereby totally destroyed owing to the great price given for corn since the Bounty took place for exporting of corn and beer which gives every fanner encouragement to grub hedgerows up and convert them into corn land".</p></blockquote>
I hope that members of the Committee will see the close parallel between that situation and our present problems with the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, the Bill is primarily concerned with the countryside. John Keats said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The poetry of earth is never dead".</p></blockquote>
One reason for promoting the Bill is my fear that that poetry is rapidly turning into blank verse and that it is doing so, principally and inescapably, in the English countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not extend the Bill to urban areas? There are, of course, hedgerows of value in urban areas, but bringing those areas and hedgerows within the scope of the Bill will inevitably encompass a vast number of domestic hedges of little or no value. The financial implications are considerable. It is difficult to justify value for taxpayers' money, especially as much hedgerow removal is likely to be the result of larger developments of land for which planning permission would be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned value for money in the urban environment. Medina borough

council withdrew its financial support for the countryside management initiative of the Liberal-controlled county council. It found that although it was paying for the preservation of valuable hedgerows, the county council was grubbing them up. It was ludicrous and had to be stopped. That is the sort of problem that can occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for telling us of that most distressing example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friends the Members for Isle of Wight and for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, it is to be hoped that local authorities will fulfil their responsibilities under the Bill, and that their responsibilities for the countryside and the environment will be enhanced. It is intended that the provisions of the Bill should form part of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. A local authority would thus be bound by future regulations and be obliged by such regulations to notify the Secretary of State of any activity that fell within the scope of the Bill. I deplore the example that was correctly drawn to the Committee's attention by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight. I hope that the Bill will go some way towards solving that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, a measure of control is already available to planning authorities to deal with such problems through the imposition of planning conditions. Elsewhere in the Bill, provision is made to clarify the importance of imposing conditions for the preservation and planting of hedgerows in the wider context of development control. My hon. Friend the Minister has already spoken about the hon. Member for North Cornwall's comments on Cornish banks. He will find the solution that he seeks in clause 15(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were accepted, the Bill would have no clearly defined scope. Far from solving the problem mentioned by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, by extending the scope of the Bill the amendment would weaken it and make hedgerows more vulnerable. I wholly accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that any Bill has to be workable and flexible in application and that, above all, it has to achieve consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point: the Bill has to achieve a broad range of consent, particularly on Report, as it will face hostility from all sorts of vested interests. If my hon. Friend cannot ensure that it has broad, cross-party support, and if it is loaded down with extra cost implications through unnecessary amendments, it will get nowhere. That will be a tragedy for all who believe that it does something important for our countryside's heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that worthwhile intervention. My hon. Friend is absolutely right One of the problems is that the amendments would make life a nightmare for millions of people who would not know whether their hedgerows fell within the scope of the Bill. We would quickly hear from them if the amendments were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were accepted, all hedgerows would be covered with the exception of the shorter hedges that satisfy the conditions of clause 6. I agree that there would be many of them. All removal of hedgerows would require
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
notification, with the exception of those categories of permitted work detailed in the Bill. That would create an intolerable burden and would entirely frustrate my intentions to provide sensible provisions that would provide value for money and would be directed at the nub of the problem of hedgerow loss. On those grounds, I hope that the amendments are withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I am sympathetic to the predicament in which he and all of us, who wish to see such a Bill reaching the statute book, are placed. We do not want to do anything that will frustrate the Bill's passage through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need to include urban and suburban hedges within the purview of the Bill is important, and I shall press the Committee to accept that. The hon. Member for Surrey, East advanced three basic arguments against the amendments. First, he spoke of the practical problem of the sheer number of hedgerows that would be included if the amendments were accepted. That is not a problem, as was shown by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. He said that the procedure would be triggered only if an application is made and notification is given to the local authority. Action would follow only if the local authority decided that it wished to intervene. Two hurdles would have to be crossed, so the numbers involved in close local authority scrutiny in urban areas would not be especially large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief additional point. If large numbers were involved in urban areas, they would tend to be the responsibility of authorities that did not have responsibility for rural areas. That would not place an enormous burden on the same authorities, but would spread it more evenly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. We would be placing a burden on local authorities across the country rather than placing an additional burden on those that would be already covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument advanced by the hon. Member for Surrey, East was that a measure of control was already available through the existing planning system. That is correct when a specific application for development is made and the removal of a hedge may come before a planning authority. However, in many cases—my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish described one—a hedgerow is removed without it being necessary for planning permission to be obtained. The current planning system offers no protection for such hedgerows. If we were to bring urban areas within the scope of the Bill, such cases would be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument advanced by the hon. Member for Surrey, East was that the Bill would have no clearly defined scope if the amendments were accepted. I disagree with that because the Bill defines a hedgerow and it applies only to hedgerows of more than 20 m long. That defines the scope of the Bill. Our amendments would recognise the value of urban and suburban hedgerows as well as those that exist in the countryside. It is important to make the point that we cannot dismiss urban hedgerows as having little general value, and it is wrong to try to distinguish between those which are of great value and others which are not. Many urban hedgerows provide
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
valuable habitats for wildlife and as there are relatively few of those in an urban setting, they are all the more important in those locations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest a possible compromise? We are concerned about those hedges which have particular value for wildlife and historical reasons. The Minister said that he will consider providing additional protection for those hedgerows and I should have thought that we were considering them rather than the leylandii type of hedgerows which might come within the scope of the bill. On that basis, I shall be happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendment, if that is in order, provided that the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. Clause 2 specifically states that a local authority may intervene only where hedgerows are a contribution to the landscape, where there is historic interest and where they are of value as habitats for plants or animals. The scope of local authority action is defined in that regard. Although I accept that we want to ensure that such hedgerows are protected, I do not believe that following the line suggested by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury would provide proper protection for suburban and urban hedgerows in the way that I would hope to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be useful to test the water to assess the feeling of the Committee, so I recommend that we press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by declaring an interest. I am a fully paid-up member of the Country Landowners Association. I was not aware until today that there was honorary membership of that body. I shall ask it about that. I am also a member of the Game Conservancy and the British Field Sports Society, which are both interested in hedges, the National Trust and several other organistions.
I have been responsible for planting trees and hedges, though on a much more modest scale than my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. I hope that when I die I shall leave more hedgerows than I removed. I have discovered an interesting mix of hedgerow—the Saxon hedgerow mix—which I hope will confuse future experts when they try to date the hedges that I have planted.
I hope that we shall deal with the amendments quickly because I appreciate that time is running out and I am sure that the Committee will want to make progress. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will support the amendment, which is designed to reassure the farming community about the extent of damage that would be acceptable. The Bill is vague about that. Farmers need to know that they will not be vexatiously prosecuted for doing something that might be considered by an over-zealous witness to be damaging to hedges. Hedges are robust and can quickly recover from many knocks. We do not want farmers to be unnecessarily prosecuted.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0968">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The farming community would be reassured if the sense of the amendments were incorporated into the Bill
The main problem is with the impairment of the quality of the hedge. We want that clarified, and the amendments suggest inserting "significantly" to do that. After discussion with other members of the Committee, who may be better equipped with legal knowledge than I, it was decided that insertion of "permanently" should also be suggested. I would be happy with either word, and would welcome my hon. Friend's comments on whether he prefers "significant" or "permanent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we had a long debate on the first amendment, which detained the Committee. As I said in my opening remarks, it is my intention that the Bill should proceed speedily through its consideration in Committee.
There might be a legal difficulty with defining the "significant", but it has been used by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East in clause 7(3)(a). Therefore, the word is already in the Bill and there should be no problem with the legal definition of it. I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham. We are not terribly worried whether the word "permanently", "significantly" or a word to the same effect is used. We are concerned that the Bill as drafted could be punitive to farmers and other owners of hedgerows. Things done to a hedge could, in some cases, be perceived as an offence. Clarification is needed and I would welcome an explanation from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will resist those amendments that attempt to insert the word "significantly" because it is one that lacks an obvious definition. What would constitute a significant impairment of a hedgerow? Would that be when half the hedgerow has been destroyed? If so, I shall oppose the inclusion of the word. Given the lack of a clear definition, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not endorse the proposal.
I have less objection to "permanently" because that has greater clarity. I accept that there could be a situation where, for example, a farmer's cattle have a go at a portion of a hedgerow. Over time the hedgerow would grow back and the damage to it would not be great enough to trigger the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my anxieties about the "permanently" is that it would provide an almost permanent excuse for the irresponsible. The temptation would be to damage or remove a hedgerow and then claim, if challenged, that the impairment was only temporary, hoping that no one would challenge in the first place. Therefore, an excuse would be provided.
Many hon. Members have been eager to pass provisions to protect badgers. I took a Bill through the House in 1973. After further improvements, we had to change its provisions about six times to get a satisfactory legal outcome. If "permanently" were included, that would provide an excuse which people would generally find unacceptable. We should then have to return to the Bill over the next decade to put it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's anxieties. Given the range of amendments tabled, the hon. Member for Hexham seems to want to qualify not the process of uprooting or removing a hedgerow, but the impairment of quality. A valid argument is being advanced about the difficulty of knowing precisely when quality has and has not been impaired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, determining when a hedgerow has been impaired is a subjective concept. I have been involved in planting and keeping hedges all my life and know that they can recover significantly from what might appear to be very rough treatment. Indeed, the rougher that some species of shrub are treated, the more vigorously they come back. The concept of pruning a rose in a garden proves that: one can prune a rose almost to its roots and next spring it will sprout and flower even more rigorously. Therefore, when considering whether a hedgerow is "significantly" or "permanently" damaged, one must bear in mind that we are dealing with subjective concepts. It would be unreasonable if every action that a farmer took to a hedge led to the local authority serving a notice on him. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's anxieties. However, I do not want anyone to get the idea that hon. Members are advocating that hedgerows should be cut back right down to ground level in the hope that they could sprout again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is quite wrong; that is called coppicing. Cutting hedges right down to the ground is usual hedgerow management, particularly in East Anglia. That is where confusions arises and is why farmers are worried. The farmers engaged in the usual 12-year rotation of coppicing their hedges will be accused by passers-by that they are destroying those hedges. They will then be reported to the council and will face possible prosecution because of a misunderstanding of usual hedgerow management practices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that East Anglia is one of the areas that has suffered the greatest hedgerow loss in the country. The Bill covers the sound management of hedgerows. I am trying to be on his side in this argument by accepting that temporary or inadvertent damage to a hedge may not always be great enough to merit the local authority's intervention under the Bill.
None of us wants constant bureaucratic intervention when it is unnecessary. I am convinced that the addition of "significantly" does not achieve that objective. I am not so sure about the introduction of the word "permanently", and shall listen to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Surrey, East. We must not set in motion a system where there is officious intervention when intervention is not needed to provide protection for hedgerows. Such protection must not be damaged by us adding to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's main thrust is directed at hedgerow destruction rather than damage or impairment. It is necessary to legislate beyond destruction because courts may be required to pass judgment on peculiar cases. For example, they may have to decide whether a hedgerow that has been severely cut back and

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
repeatedly driven over—different practices to those discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham—had been destroyed. That loophole must be closed by providing for the offence of impairment of quality. Subsection (1)(b) of the clause would provide that Amendment No. 60 and others that would substitute the concept of permanent damage are unnecessary. Is not it the case that "permanent impairment" more or less represents the same thing as "destruction"? Importing the concept into the Bill would confuse its purpose.
I say to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that I sympathise with amendments dealing with "significant impairment", including amendment No. 50. I am not convinced that they are necessary, but the inclusion of the word "significantly" would meet some of the worries of those who would be affected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is happy with the word "significantly" then we would not proceed with the amendments including the word "permanently". I hope that he has accepted that farmers will feel extremely threatened by vexatious prosecution unless a provision similar to the one that we are debating is included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand my hon. Friend's point. With it in mind, I am willing to accept amendments Nos. 50,59,70,82,83,84,87,88,89,91,95 and 98. I am not prepared to accept amendments referring to permanent impairment for the reason that I have stated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to intervene, Mr. Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember the hon. Member for Surrey, East giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I wish to speak, Mr. Hill. I find it incredible that a Member of Parliament with a Bill that the Government approve of and which has the good will of almost everyone in the Committee Room—including those in the Public Gallery—and of the conservation bodies, will so easily give way and provide the opportunity for vexatious wriggling by those who already plan to defeat his Bill's purposes. It is extremely unwise of him to seek to please his hon. Friends in the way that he has done, probably risking the value and meaning of a Bill of which he could be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Needless to say, I reject that. I am prepared to accept the amendments that I mentioned on the ground that they improve the Bill and its operational efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
