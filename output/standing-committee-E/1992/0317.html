</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recall at the end of last week's sitting we were embroiled in an illuminating discussion on my amendments Nos. 111 and 112, and amendments Nos. 21 and 24, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). The amendments deal with the requirements of any reinstated hedgerow. As a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
result of the constructive debate last week, I should like to withdraw amendments Nos. 111 and 112 and in due course formally to move amendments Nos. 122 and 123 in their place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 122 and 123 would require the owner of the land where an offence had been committed by the destruction or impairment of the quality of a hedgerow to replace that hedgerow with one that consists of shrubs and trees of an appropriate species that will correspond to it. I listened carefully to the concerns raised last week by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). Like him, I certainly do not want local authorities to insist that tall, gappy hedgerows should be replaced by similarly tall, ill-managed shrubs. While the Bill cannot ensure that hedgerows are well managed, it is certainly appropriate that a replacement hedge would get the best possible start. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, in the interests of good management, it will usually be appropriate to replant with short shrubs, which can be properly managed as they grow to give a good bottom to the hedge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that those aims are entirely consistent with my original amendments, but I am persuaded that, in the interests of clarity, those amendments should be revised. That is why the new amendments do not contain any reference to the size of the replacement shrubs. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, therefore, be reassured on that point. I think that all members of the Committee are agreed that there needs to be a duty to replant trees and shrubs of an appropriate species. By maintaining that duty, the Bill will ensure that the replanted hedgerow has the obvious potential to grow to match the quality of the original. Of course, in most cases, it is not possible to plant a new hedge that will immediately have the same qualities as the one which was destroyed. To that extent, I am in agreement with the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. A replacement hedge of healthy young plants needs time to grow to match the stature of the mature shrubs that it is replacing. That is why my amendments refer to trees and shrubs that will correspond. That is, future tense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends' amendments Nos. 119 and 120, while very similar to my own amendments, still contain a reference to shrubs or trees that will "in time" correspond to the originals. The Committee has spent considerable time discussing semantics and I am reluctant to burden it any further, but I should like to make a further point on that subject. I realise that the intention is to make it clear that local authorities should not expect farmers and landowners to replant hedges using mature, 10 ft tall plants. However, the danger is that the phrase "in time" will mean at some undefined point in the future. The farmer or landowner then need only plant some new shrubs and leave them, arguing that, at some point, they will correspond with the hedgerow that has been lost, even if that is in 200 years' time. The problem is that "will" is, in any case, the future tense and so the addition of "in time" would appear to add nothing. However, as hon. Members know, the courts do not regard words in legislation as unnecessary, but strive to give them meaning. There is, therefore, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
danger that "in time" will be regarded as meaning rather more than "in the future".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments already make clear that we are talking about plants that will correspond. That recognises that plants need time to grow. However, it also implies that there is a duty on the landowner to ensure that the hedgerow will correspond with the original rather than leaving it to nature and the passing of time. That is essential to the effectiveness of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friends are reassured that farmers will not be required to replant fully-grown mature shrubs. Should further reassurance be needed, I feel certain that the guidance notes to be provided by my hon. Friend the Minister will make the matter abundantly clear. I was making that point as we concluded last week's sitting. I hope therefore, that my hon. Friends will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment and Countryside (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can assist in persuading my hon. Friends the Members for Hexham and for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and, indeed, all other members of the Committee, I would like to make it perfectly plain that the guidance notes that we shall issue will make it abundantly clear that the appropriate species should be chosen when replacing hedgerow in replanting. In all circumstances, however small, bare-rooted plants that are one or two years old would be used. We shall also make it abundantly clear that in no circumstances would we expect a farmer or anyone else in the countryside to replace a hedge with hedgerow, grown container plants or shrubs of a large size. That would be nonsensical and impractical, and would not be the proper rural thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 5, line 28, leave out subsection (5). The aim of the amendment is to explore the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth).
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
As drafted, the Bill requires the owner of a hedge to reinstate diseased shrubs or trees once he has removed them. We are concerned that the subsection provides no incentive to remove those diseased shrubs or trees. It would be folly were the Bill's provisions to cause people to leave diseased shrubs or trees in place for fear of being under a duty to reinstate them when they do not want to. I am sure that my hon. Friend's response will be that this matter comes under proper management, and he would be right. However, if the owner did not want to reinstate a particular stretch of hedge, he would leave the diseased trees and shrubs in place and allow them gradually to rot, wither and become an eyesore on the landscape, that is because, as has already been said several times in our proceedings, the Bill does not include a positive provision to manage hedges. My hon. Friend needs to explain his intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I hope that we shall be able to make substantial progress with the Bill today. I do not want to detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a potential danger in the provision which states that if a diseased hedgerow is removed, it must be replaced. I am unsure, however, whether removing subsection (5) would take us forward because that would mean that the landowner or farmer could allow the diseased hedgerow to continue in existence or to remove it completely without a duty to reinstate. I suspect that the same incentives and disincentives would apply if the subsection were removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, but I do not believe that the amendment would resolve the problem. I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will retain subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am able to reassure the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I, too, am anxious to make progress, but perhaps it would be helpful if I explained the intention behind the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as amended, would make it clear that a stretch of hedgerow could be removed on two grounds of plant health: first, where the work would be in line with proper management of the hedge; secondly, as a result of amendment No. 118, which the Committee agreed to last week, where it would be in line with proper management of adjacent crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17(1) would ensure that any work carried out in the course of the proper management of the hedgerow would not be treated as destroying it or impairing its quality. That provision would be necessary so that farmers and landowners could get on with their hedgerow maintenance programmes without having to notify local authorities every time they needed to trim, lay or even coppice their hedges. In those circumstances, there would be no need to reinstate. No shrubs would have been removed, merely cut back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the removal of diseased shrubs or trees in a hedgerow in line with proper management of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
hedge would not be sufficient. A healthy hedge, especially if it were a hedge of value, should be reinstated. That is why clause 7(5) would provide a duty to reinstate in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that it accepted the principle of proper management of adjacent crops last week. As a result, we agreed to amendments Nos. 41 and 42, which would place a duty to reinstate hedges removed for that reason. We are concerned with the removal of dead or diseased shrubs or trees in a hedgerow in accordance with good management. I suggest that gapping up, which is, effectively, reinstatement, is similarly in keeping with the diktats of good management. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury pre-empted that response and I hope that he will be persuaded by my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general rule, to require reinstatement in such cases would be consistent with the concept of good management. I accept that there will be occasions when reinstatement would not be sensible, but I do not think that that is a reason to dispense completely with the duty to reinstate. It would be difficult to provide for such occasions without creating loopholes that could be exploited by the unscrupulous. Each case would need to be judged on its merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would allow the local authority to waive the duty to reinstate. If the authority saw fit to enforce the reinstatement, there would be a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hedgerow from which the diseased shrubs have been removed might not be of particular value. That judgment would not have been made prior to the work because the work is permitted—it does not need to be notified. However, if the farmer or landowner were to decide that he did not want to gap up the hedgerow, he may apply to the local authority to have the reinstatement duty waived. If the local authority judges that the hedgerow is not of value, it would make sense for the duty to be waived. If the hedgerow is of value, it would be appropriate that the reinstatement should occur and the hedge made good. That would be consistent with the Bill's aim to ensure that valuable hedgerows will be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to ensure, as the Committee knows, that the Bill's provisions will not be unduly burdensome on farmers or landowners. That is why normal management works are exempt from the need to give notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious, however, that in providing such exemptions we are providing potential loopholes, which could be taken advantage of by those determined to remove hedgerows. It is therefore important that effective reinstatement provisions are included in the Bill. That is recognised in tree preservation order legislation, where there is a duty on the landowner to replant a protected tree that is removed because it is dead, dying or dangerous. The Bill will not supersede any TPOs that may have been made on any tree in a line of hedge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that any guidance issued as a result of the Bill makes that point absolutely clear. For example, if dead elms are removed from a stretch of hedgerow, the Bill does not require their replacement with new elms. The Bill places a duty on the owner or tenant to do such work as may be required to restore the quality of the hedgerow. The Bill provides authorities with the necessary flexibility and discretion to enforce the duty sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that if the hedgerow in question is of quality, the landowner will have the chance to investigate whether the hedgerow incentive scheme, which was introduced by my hon. Friend the Minister last year, might come into play. It is conceivable that if a hedgerow is of value the HIS will be available and a grant may be made available to the landowner for gapping up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is not appropriate, and I ask him to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard many fine words from my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East. The plain fact is that the Bill would require diseased trees or shrubs to be replaced. It would be a great shame—it would have the opposite effect to what my hon. Friend wants—if the Bill were to discourage owners of hedges from removing diseased shrubs or trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that my amendment provides a loophole because it would be for the local authority to issue a notice to reinstate the hedge if diseased shrubs or trees were removed. It would then be for the owner of the hedge to provide evidence—a certificate or a photograph—in court that those trees or shrubs were diseased. I cannot see that the amendment creates a huge loophole, but I am afraid that the effect of the Bill will mean that diseased shrubs and hedges throughout the countryside will not be removed. I do not think that that is what my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will accept that the clause is entirely in keeping with the notion of good management. If a farmer has a diseased hedgerow or part of such a hedgerow, it would be natural for the farmer to remove the diseased shrubs or the part of the hedge. It would, equally, be in accordance with good management for the farmer to replace the gap through reinstatement. I do not understand how the Bill interferes with that perfectly natural process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, want to make progress this morning. On the basis that I shall return to the matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 5, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(6B) A dispensation under subsection (6) above shall not be unreasonably withheld.".</p></q>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
Having failed to remove subsection (5), which imposes the duty to reinstate diseased shrubs or trees, the amendment provides a further onus on the local authority to act reasonably. A notice will be issued that the diseased shrubs or trees will be reinstated, and the local authority should be under an obligation to act reasonably. There is a statutory precedent. In the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, section 10(9) states:
	<br><q><p>"A licence under this section shall not be unreasonably withheld or revoked."</p></q>
I ask the Committee to consider that matter seriously so that, in line with my sentiments under the previous amendment, we try to reach an amicable solution that will ensure that diseased shrubs and trees can be handled in a sensible manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to persuade the Committee that to state in the Bill that local authorities must not act unreasonably is unnecessary. It is implicit in the Bill that local authorities should act reasonably, and to put that in the Bill is to state the obvious without—this is an important point which my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury may wish to bear in mind—making it any more certain that they will act reasonably. The right of appeal against a reinstatement notice is a safeguard against unreasonable behaviour. We referred earlier to guidance, and that has a role to play in this matter.

The amendment deals with the enforcement notice. If a local authority believes that under clause 7 reinstatement has not taken place, it has a duty to issue an enforcement notice. It is unreasonable to allow a local authority as long as four years within which to issue a notice. It should act in the public interest to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
uphold the best principles of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has told us that local authorities will act reasonably, and it is reasonable that the enforcement notice should be issued within two years. It would be unreasonable for the owner of a hedge to have a sword of Damocles hanging over his head and not to know whether he had complied with the wishes of the local authority for four years. That is contrary to the rules of natural justice, and my amendment to reduce the period from four to two years is thoroughly sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To demonstrate that I can be as reasonable as local authorities, I am pleased that my hon. Friend tabled the amendment and I am happy to accept it. I hope that the Committee shares my opinion on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had I been left to my own devices, I would probably have preferred to retain the Bill as drafted. But in the interest of achieving the broadest degree of agreement and consensus in pushing the Bill forward, I am happy to endorse the argument of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 6, line 3, after "impairment", insert "of the quality".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers what we believe is a simple drafting error. It would insert "of the quality" and would make the clause workable in the way that is intended. The amendment is thoroughly sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would replace the reference in clause 8(3) to "impairment of the hedgerow" with
	<br><q><p>"impairment of the quality of the hedgerow".</p></q>
It is logical that every reference to impairment of a hedgerow should be spelt out to include a reference to impairment of its quality, but I submit that it is unnecessary to do so in this instance. Clause 8 covers enforcement of the duty to reinstate a hedgerow and that duty is set out in clause 7. The word "impairment" in clause 8(3) is not deficient but merely a reference back to clause 7, in which every reference to impairment specifies impairment in terms of a hedgerow's quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same could be said about the reference to destruction of a hedgerow in clause 8(3), which also stems from the longer phrase in clause 7—"uprooted or otherwise destroyed".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that the amendment is unnecessary and that he will withdraw it. However, at the risk of being excessively reasonable, I am prepared to accept the amendment if he persists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury will not persist. The problem is that if the words "of the quality" were included, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
would qualify "impairment" and "destruction". Subsection 3(a) would then read,
	<br><q><p>"beginning with the destruction or impairment of the quality of the hedgerow".</p></q>
That could be interpreted as meaning the destruction of the quality of the hedgerow as well as the impairment of the quality of the hedgerow. We want destruction of a hedgerow to be covered by the clause. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, but I fear that we might throw the baby out with the bath water if we accepted his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To enlarge on what my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East said, clause 7(2), in lines 8 and 9, states:
	<br><q><p>"Where a stretch of hedgerow is uprooted or otherwise destroyed, or its quality is impaired".</p></q>
It would be consistent with that wording, which has already been agreed to, if clause 8 also contained a reference to "impairment of its quality". Indeed, it would be absurd if the same consistency were not followed in clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am being as reasonable as my hon. Friend, and as reasonable as local authorities will be, in asking my hon. Friend to consider my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept my point, which would be met if the words were changed to refer to
	<br><q><p>"impairment of the quality or destruction of the hedgerow"?</p></q>
If the clause were simply left with the words
	<br><q><p>"destruction or impairment of the quality",</p></q>
we might incorporate a difficulty which is not intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. In 	<i>Hansard</i> last week, I was quoted as saying:
	<br><q><p>"I hope that the Minister will be redrafted."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 10 March 1993; c.106.]</p></q>
I certainly said no such thing, and I have amended the record. I am sure that, had I said any such thing, you, Mr. Hill, would have ruled me out of order and, in any case, the Minister's explanations at various stages in our proceedings have been extremely helpful. In no way would I wish to impute that he should be redrafted. May I continue under amendment No. 90?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a technical amendment. The subsection would provide the owner of a hedge that is in a site of special scientific interest to perform a double bureaucratic hoop. First, he would have to apply to English Nature. If the Committee thinks that the amendment has been wrongly drafted because it includes the word "Council", I shall explain that that word refers not to a local authority but to the old Nature Conservancy Council, which is still its official name. The word "Council", therefore, is correct but we should know it colloquially as English Nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
Let us suppose that the owner were granted permission by English Nature. He would then have to go through the normal notification procedure to the local planning authority. I think that that would be an unfair bureaucratic hurdle, which the amendment aims to overcome. That is not easy because, in overcoming that hurdle, my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and I want to preserve the provisions that would grant compensation to the owner of a hedge within an SSSI should he be refused permission by English Nature to remove the hedge. We have considered this matter carefully and we feel that the amendment is the best way to resolve it. The owner of a hedge within an SSSI would apply to English Nature which, before it granted permission, would have to consult the local planning authority. Provided that both bodies were happy, English Nature would grant permission for a hedge within an SSSI to be removed. The amendment relates to only a few hedges, but those owners of hedges who are unlucky enough to wish to remove a hedge in an SSSI have an especially bureaucratic hurdle to overcome. I commend amendment No. 90 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, whose argument seems to be based on the need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. It would not make sense for an application to have to be made both to English Nature and the local authority for exactly the same purpose. However, I have one concern about the amendment. As I understand, the penalties for destroying a hedgerow under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are less severe than the penalties envisaged in the Bill. If, for hedgerows within sites of special scientific interest, the prime focus for application and penalty were to rest with English Nature and the provisions of the Wildlife and Country side Act—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not accept that English Nature is likely to be far more knowledgeable and expert in deciding whether a hedge should be removed—its contribution to the countryside and habitat, for example—than some local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case, but I am sure that it does not apply to all local authorities, many of which, especially those in rural areas, have considerable expertise on questions of hedgerow management and conservation. That raises an important point. If the effect of the amendment is to make the penalty for breaching protection of a hedgerow within an SSSI less than that which applies to a hedgerow elsewhere, we shall end up with a piece of nonsense. If I can be reassured on that point, I should certainly wish to endorse the aim of reducing bureaucracy. My concern is whether we are reducing the protection of hedgerows, especially those in SSSIs where, if anything, protection should be stronger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a hedgerow is in an SSSI, where hedgerow removal must be notified to the Nature Conservancy Council, the amendment requires the Council—I shall call it English Nature—not to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
consent to the operation unless it has first secured the agreement of the local authority to the consent being granted. As currently drafted, the applicant must first approach the local authority and gain its consent before approaching English Nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see two purposes behind the amendment. The first, I suspect, is to ensure that the procedures for ensuring any payment of compensation under a management agreement with the council are not undermined. That seems reasonable. The second is to ensure that only one application is needed. I sympathise, but I am advised that there are insuperable difficulties in designing one procedure to be followed when applying for consent for hedgerow removal, which adequately takes account of the requirements of both pieces of legislation involved: the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1918 and the Bill. The decisions being made in each instance are based on different grounds and the time scale for decision is different in the two cases; English Nature has four months to reach a decision, while the local authority has 28 days under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of amendment No. 90 is that English Nature should be approached first, and that it should gain the agreement of the local authority for hedgerow removal. In that way, the normal notification procedure to the local authority would be circumvented. That touches on the point made by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. The problem therefore arises about the time limits for making a decision, what assurances, there are that the application will be recorded in the register and most important, what happens to the applicant's right of appeal if the local authority does not give its consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the intentions of the amendment, but it would take insufficient account of the complexities of tying together two different procedures. I shall suggest an alternative that would have the great merit of simplicity. There would be no need to make special provision in the Bill for hedgerows in SSSIs because they are required to be notified to English Nature under the terms of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Therefore, clause 12 would be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A farmer or landowner would be able to apply to English Nature or the local authority in the first instance. There may be merit in applying to both organisations in parallel. That could save time by not being locked into a sequential process handled by one organisation. If English Nature were to decide that a hedgerow should be retained, it would negotiate compensation in the normal way. If it were content that the hedgerow could be removed, there would be no compensation and the applicant would have to ensure that other obligations, such as local authority approval under the provisions of the Bill, were met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If applications were made to English Nature and the local authority in parallel, the decision from the local authority, which would be forthcoming within 28 days, would be available by the time of English Nature's decision and would not delay the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and most important, my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury alluded to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
the fact that that would occur in few cases. It is important to see the whole matter in its proper perspective. I am advised that there have been few cases in England in recent years in which the main issue, in respect of proposed works in an SSSI, was hedgerow removal. A recent informal response from English Nature made it clear that it was unable to identify any management agreement in the past few years which was prompted by hedgerow removal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a minor technical detail. I am sympathetic to my hon. Friend's point, but I ask him to withdraw the amendment. In due course, I shall recommend to the Committee that clause 12 is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The primary objective of us being in this place is to produce good legislation. I ask you, Mr. Hill, to put yourself in the position of a hedge owner in an SSSI. You have not asked to be in it, but were put in it by English Nature. You want to remove a hedge and have to consider to whom to apply. We are talking about people who do not like dealing with paperwork. They like being out in the countryside getting on with what they do best. To make such people go through a double bureaucratic hurdle would be to make thoroughly bad law. It would go against the edict of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to reduce unnecessary legislation, bureaucracy and costs to industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be exposing farmers to the commercial world, particularly under the provisions of the Bill that is passing through the other place. We shall be imposing an unfair bureaucratic hurdle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 is perfectly simple. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East said, English Nature would have four weeks in which to decide whether a hedge should be removed. Within those four weeks, it has a duty, under the amendment, to consult the local planning authority. If the local planning authority says, "No, you cannot remove that hedge", English Nature says no to the applicant and pays him compensation. If the local planning authority says, "Yes, you may remove that hedge", English Nature must decide whether the applicant may remove the hedge. If English Nature agrees, the applicant may remove the hedge, but if it decides that, for wildlife or habitat reasons, the hedge is worth saving, it refuses permission although the local authority said yes and is obliged to pay compensation under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is far simpler, fairer and less bureaucratic and I strongly urge the Committee to accept it although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East said, we are dealing with comparatively few cases. I urge the Committee to try to pass the best possible laws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely with the intention of passing the best possible laws that I have adopted this approach. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
and Tewkesbury spoke eloquently and passionately about the needs of the farming community at this difficult time and I have made it clear to the Committee that I am sympathetic to that view. I have been at pains to keep the legislation as light as possible to reduce the burdens on farming and other rural communities to a bare minimum. I do not accept that the solution provided by the clause is unduly burdensome or onerous for the farming community. The forms involved will be kept as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not safeguard the landowner's right to compensation from English Nature. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury should understand that, as should the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke passionately about not imposing burdens on the farming community but he failed to take account of the fact that the clause will impose a burden on virtually no one at all. The Committee should bear that in mind when deciding what to do with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong discussion any longer than necessary and, in a moment, I shall withdraw the amendment. Can my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East explain how the procedure which I have just explained would work? Can he explain why, under my amendment, compensation under the terms and provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 would be lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that compensation would be lost but that the amendment would not provide additional safeguards for compensation under that Act. English Nature must always have regard to other enactments which may affect its decision.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it would be reasonable to expect my hon. Friend to provide additional safeguards in the Bill but, equally, I cannot see that any rights to compensation under the Wildlife and Countryside Act are taken away by the Bill or, in particular, by my amendment, which would simplify the Bill.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 80 is a probing amendment. It was tabled because the Bill does not define the prescribed length. This group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 47 and 48 which seem to cover that point and perhaps the hon. Member for Surrey, East will confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 covers a slightly different point. Clause 15(6) states:
	<br><q><p>"The continuity of a hedgerow is to be treated as broken by a junction with another hedgerow."</p></q>
The 20 m provision is no longer in the Bill but may be reinstated in due course. Indeed, there is a broad consensus that it should be reinstated. If hedges of less than 20 m are not protected, and if that 20 m length of hedgerow is, at some point in its length, joined by another hedgerow, it would not be protected. That may remove protection from some valuable hedgerows. That is my worry about subsection (6) and why I tabled amendment No. 81.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 was tabled purely in a spirit of inquiry and amendment No. 81 was tabled in a spirit of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment. What is a hedgerow? It is a line of bushes forming a barrier. Everyone would accept that a line of bushes forms a hedgerow even if it has 1 m gaps. Everyone would probably understand that it forms a hedgerow if it has 5 m gaps. However, people would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
far less prepared to consider it to be a hedgerow if it had gaps of 10 m, and they would almost certainly not consider it to be a hedgerow if it had a bit of a hedge here, with a gap of 20 m there, followed by another bit of a hedge, another gap and another hedge and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, you ruled me out of order last week, Mr. Hill, for producing some diagrams, which means that I must describe this matter. I hope that we shall reinstate clause 6 on Report. Let us assume for the purposes of our discussions that bits of hedgerows over 20 m are to be included in the scope of the Bill. If gaps of more than 5 m or, as amendment No. 48 provides, more than 10m, would all be covered by the Bill's provisions, that could result in the ridiculous situation where little bits of hedge for miles would be covered by the provisions, simply because the prescribed gap was too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East needs to explain what he expects the amendment to achieve. If little bits of hedgerow are to be protected all over the place, that would be almost as bad as protecting bits of hedges that are under 20 m, and the Bill's provisions would be unworkable. Before we take our discussions further, perhaps my hon. Friend could tell us what he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the concern of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that this point should be as clear as possible, and I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will be able to help us. The Committee will recall that at an earlier stage in our proceedings I expressed concern about the treatment of Cornish banks, which are especially prone to the problems to which the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury referred. A bank can have a stone face but be basically of earth construction for quite a length. On top of that bank there could be an intermittent, woody growth. The gaps between that woody growth will be of critical importance in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister kindly wrote to me about Cornish banks after our previous exchange and, as the amendment that I tabled has not been selected, I shall refer briefly to the treatment of such banks in the context of the Bill's provisions and of the parallel incentive scheme, which encourages farmers to maintain suitable field boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said, since our previous discussions, that a Cornish bank that does not have a substantial woody growth on top would not be eligible for the incentive scheme and would not fall within the criteria of the clause. That is of considerable concern to me and I hope that the Minister will put on record his remark that
	<br><q><p>"the Countryside Commission is currently considering what, if anything, is needed for the protection enhancement of these boundaries."</p></q>
The Bill and the incentive scheme are intended to protect those constructions that are not dry-stone walls—I think that we all accept that they are outside the scope of the Bill and the scheme—but the traditional field boundaries of many parts of the west

country, which form important natural habitats for a range of plants and wildlife species. Those field boundaries in every other way are precisely the sort of landscape feature that I know that the hon. Member for Surrey, East wants to protect. I hope that both he and the Minister will be prepared to encourage and reassure me this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman would agree with what I am about to say. My constituents who farm in the Cotswolds have dry-stone walls which, over many years, have become derelict and collapsed. Bits of bushes grow all over the place. If we are not careful, those bits of bushes that become a continuous line of bush, even though they were never intended to be a hedgerow, could come within the scope of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend or the Minister will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could cite many other examples. In the fens, where land is extremely fertile, it takes only a few years for a line of bushes to grow up alongside a dyke. If we are not careful, bushes that were never planted, which just seeded themselves, could come within the scope of the Bill. The clause is critical and it requires careful clarification by the Minister, either now or in guidance notes. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East must explain to the Committee the purpose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help to clarify the matter. The Bill specifically refers to hedgerows. Irrespective of what forms the base of the hedgerow—what the hedge grows on, whether it is in peaty soil, on top of a wall or in a hedge bank—the essential factor is the hedgerow plants. They determine whether something is a hedgerow and whether it is protected. I would guess that if an earth bank was intact and in perfect condition but the hedgerow on top was missing, or gaps prevented it from being a hedgerow, or it was less than 20 m, irrespective of the face that once upon a time it may have been a perfect Cornish hedge with wall and hedgerow intact, it would not qualify under the Bill because although the stone wall and earthwork might be intact, the hedgerow plants would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Cornish bank qualifies under the hedgerow incentive scheme, provided that there is sufficient hedge to qualify or the Countryside Commission regards it as sufficiently important to give grants for it. If, however, no hedgerow exists, or the commission decides that it does not want to give a grant in certain circumstances—perhaps because the hedge is of insufficient quality—there will be no qualification for a hedgerow incentive scheme grant. However, the earthworks and walls might qualify under the countryside stewardship scheme. Other schemes are available for repair and restoration of earth banks or dry-stone walls, and the hedgerow incentive scheme is available for hedgerows. In certain circumstances, the two will come together. The HIS provides for payments of £25 a metre—or is it £40?—it seems dashed good in any case, especially if one is doing it oneself. Generous payments are available, therefore, for stone and earth banks with hedges on top.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler). I entirely endorse what my hon. Friend the Minister has just said. The Bill relates to hedgerows; that is inescapable. The Bill recognises, however, that the living components of a hedge, which we are seeking to protect, may grow on a bank and, to the extent that the bank is part and parcel of the hedgerow's existence, be protected by the Bill. It is clear that a bank on which woody vegetation is growing may be considered a hedgerow and be covered by the Bill. However, a bank without woody vegetation would fall outside the scope fo the Bill. I hope that that makes the situation clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is concerned that the definition will include more hedges under 20 m, which could, as a result of any de minimis clause, be removed. I assure him that I intend to table an amendment at a later stage to permit the removal of hedgerows of 20 m or less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood me. My concern about subsection (6) is not that hedgerows under 20 m might be subject to protection, but that hedgerows of 20 m or more might not be protected because of a junction with another hedge. I am concerned that subsection (6) would remove some hedgerows from protection. I do not want that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman by saying that I intend to table an amendment to cover the points which he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly confusion about the aims of this part of the Bill and that it centres on the use of the word "gap". I shall clarify the meaning. There are two distinct types of gap in a hedgerow—interruptions and breaks. First, there are short gaps that represent only temporary interruptions in the continuity of a single hedgerow. In other words, the stretches of hedge at either end of a gap are part of the same single hedgerow. I suggest that 10 m should be the maximum width of such a gap, and I shall give my reasons for that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are longer gaps. Although the line of the hedge might be continued at the further end, for practical purposes such gaps should be treated as distinct breaks in the continuity of the hedgerow. In other words, the stretches of hedge at either end of a gap are separate hedgerows. A gap of over 10 m should be considered to be such a break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that amendment No. 80 is merely a probing amendment, but it would remove the distinction between interruptions and gaps. That raises the question why the distinction is needed. The effective operation of a Bill depends on the determinations of where a hedgerow starts and finishes. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said on that matter. Clear definition of where a hedgerow ends would mean that the length of a hedgerow could be measured. That would allow the implimentation of the de minimis length exemption, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
was the subject of clause 6 and which the Committee wants to reintroduce. I wonder why clause 6 was not accepted last week. Without a clear definition of what is an interruption and a break, farmers and landowners would be unclear about whether a hedgerow measures less than 20 m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of hedgerows in a hedgerow network could be easily calculated. That would enable local authorities to bring multiple prosecutions against farmers who illegally undertake large-scale removal of hedgerows. Farmers and landowners would not be able to claim that an entire stretch of hedge is one hedgerow. Magistrates' courts would have a flexibility to impose a more appropriate fine through the mechanism of a fine per hedgerow removed. That concept underpins the protection system proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will understand that, unfortunately, there is no such thing as a standard hedge. It is often far from clear where one hedgerow ends and another begins. The briefest glance at the countryside reveals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Chairman's 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the Room and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the lack of a quorum was so easily remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefest glance at the countryside shows that many hedges are thin and gappy. Sometimes there are small, isolated holes in an otherwise solid line of hedge. In other instances there may be short remnants of a hedge. The hedgerow incentive scheme was specifically designed to deal with that problem. In some cases, it will be clear that the hedge should be treated as a single hedgerow. In others, where the remnants might be 100 m apart, it would be impractical to consider them as anything other than separate hedges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As those distinctions will not always be so clear, it will be essential for a system to be in place to remove the element of subjectivity which would inevitably be involved in deciding where a hedgerow begins and ends. It is essential that landowners, farmers and local authorities will be in no doubt about what constitutes an interruption or a break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system would have to be understood. Landowners, farmers and local authorities should be in no doubt about what constitutes the end of a hedgerow. The system should be practical so that farmers are not required to seek approval to remove hedgerows which, to all intents and purposes, have already disappeared. It must be legally watertight and farmers must not, through permitted works, be able to split up a hedgerow into separate, smaller sections. The best way of ensuring that is to set a maximum length of gap which will be considered to be only an interruption. Fixing the length in this way will remove ambiguity on whether openings in a hedge are gaps in one hedge or breaks between several hedges and will ensure consist-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
ent measurement of hedgerows and consistent decision-making in all local authority areas. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury welcomes that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has been persuaded that his amendment would have led to confusion among farmers and local authorities. It would have removed an important element of flexibility, both for farmers who may wish to remove short remnants of hedge and for the courts, which would have been unsure of their ability to impose sufficiently serious penalties on the worst offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that it is necessary to define what constitutes an interruption in a hedgerow and what is a break between two hedges, we must decide what that definition should be. The Bill does not make it clear what length of gap constitutes an interruption. That is to be prescribed by the Secretary of State. Under amendment No. 32, any gap of more than 5 m in a hedge would constitute a break in its continuity. A gap of 5 m or less would merely constitute an interruption and would not mark its end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am persuaded by the argument of hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that the Bill should state clearly the maximum gap that will be considered to be an interruption in a hedgerow. But I do not believe that 5 m is the appropriate length, which is why I tabled my amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 is a drafting amendment to allow the prescribed maximum length of an interruption to be set out by amendment No. 48. Amendment No. 48 would set the maximum length of gap which would constitute an interruption at 10 m. That figure has not been plucked out of the air. Entranceways cut in hedgerows may need to be of considerable width to allow access by combine harvesters and other large farm machinery. I am advised that a 10 m gateway would allow access to even the widest of combines. It is essential that the maximum width of an interruption should be greater than the maximum width needed for operational entranceways. Fanners are permitted to move or create entranceways without obtaining approval from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, would give farmers the freedom to introduce gateways of more than 5 m into a hedge and so break it into shorter, unprotected sections of 20 m or less. Those could then be removed without notification. By continually resiting wide entrances, a farmer could soon remove vast stretches of valuable hedgerow without being required to gain approval from the local authority. The Secretary of State must have the power to alter the length in regulations if it becomes clear that the specified length is too short or too long to provide effective, practical control. For example, if the size of combine harvesters continues to increase and we are faced with monster combines, it may be necessary to amend the 10 m specification, which seems appropriate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
I hope that my hon. Friend recognises the necessity for the prescribed length of a gap to be greater than the maximum width necessary to allow access by large farm machinery and I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment in favour of my amendments No. 47 and 48.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 was tabled by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and would remove from the Bill the definition that a hedgerow junction represents the end of each of the hedgerows that form it. That would mean that an extensive and elaborate network of hedges, if continuous, could be considered to be one meandering and intersected hedgerow. The same argument applies to this amendment as to the hon. Gentleman's preceding amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hedgerow junctions provide the clearest way to determine the end of individual hedges. Such a definition is easily understandable for both farmers and local authorities. The definition is essential to allow the practical implementation of the de minimis exemption for hedgerows of less than 20 m and to allow the number of individual hedges in any hedgerow network to be readily calculable for the purposes of prosecution. If the hedgerow junctions do not mark the end of hedgerows, unscrupulous farmers and landowners will be able to remove vast stretches of hedge and claim that it was only one long, meandering hedge. The magistrates court could then impose a fine for only one hedge, even if the offender had removed miles of hedge. I am sure that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury would not welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the operation of the de minimis exemption would be severely impaired. If hedgerows are deemed to continue around corners at junctions, the number of hedgerows of 20 m or less will be greatly reduced. Although that would increase the number of protected hedgerows, the increase would only be from short hedgerow remnants which are attached to a hedge at one end but unattached at the other. Those are unlikely to be of value, and the result would be unnecessary interference in the day-to-day operation of farms and an unnecessary increase in the burden on local authorities. I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little unsure about what the hon. Member for Surrey, East was saying in relation to my amendment. Initially, he appeared to be saying that he accepted some of my concerns and would introduce further proposals at a later stage. But later he appeared to be arguing specifically against the aim of my amendment. I was concerned by his comments. I accept that it would be a nonsense to designate as one hedgerow what he called "miles of meandering hedges" turning around corners, but I do not want one length of straight hedgerow which happens to be joined at a T-junction by another hedgerow to be removed from protection. To say that because of the T-junction it constitutes two hedgerows instead of one, although it is a straight line of hedge, seems equally nonsensical. I am afraid that the comments of the hon. Member for Surrey, East do
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
not address that issue and I hope that, on reflection, he might take that point on board, although I accept, of course, that a hedge which turns around several corners and which is affected by several junctions should not be designated as one hedgerow. There is a problem where a straight hedge has a T-junction with another hedge—that would fall foul of the provisions of subsection (6). I maintain my concern and hope that it can be addressed by consensus on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because amendments Nos. 47 and 48 address the issue, I am more than willing to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I caused the hon. Gentleman confusion. I thought that I had made clear my opinion of amendment No. 81. Given his concern for short hedgerows, I can confirm that I intend later to provide that a hedgerow which is less than 20 m but which is joined at both ends will be protected. I assure the hon. Gentleman of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is welcome, but it is not the problem. The problem is where a hedgerow of 20 m, 25 m, or 30 m has a T-junction with another hedgerow in its middle. Under the provisions of clause 15, although such a hedgerow would satisfy the test of 20 m length for protection purposes, that T-junction would disqualify it from protection. That is my concern and I fear that the hon. Member for Surrey, East has not gone so far as to allay it. I hope that we can return to that issue.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes wonder at the Committee's ability to become embroiled in extraordinarily arcane and detailed argument about definitions. The definition of a fence in the Bill is specific for a purpose. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury—I think that this will meet his concern—that the definition is all-encompassing and has a very specific use. It is used only in relation to fences which fill gaps in a hedgerow. The purpose of the definition is to make clear that a gap of 10 m or less is not a break in the continuity of the hedge, even if the gap is filled by another form of boundary fence. It would be inconsistent and illogical for a 5 m gap in a hedge which is filled by a stretch of fence to be considered only as an interruption in that hedgerow, if the same gap, filled by a stretch of dry-stone wall, were considered to be a break between two hedgerows. If the definition is removed, those hedges which run alongside stone or brick walls or ditches will be less well protected because every slight gap would constitute a break in continuity and the hedge could be sub-divided into several short individual hedgerows of less than 20 m.

Subsection (8) appears to be legal jargon and I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East could explain it. In other words, this is a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to offer clarification. Clause 15(8) is a fundamental part of the Bill and makes it clear that it is an offence not only to destroy or impair a whole hedgerow but to destroy or impair any section of a hedgerow. Amendment No. 92, if accepted, would render the Bill impotent as it would create much ambiguity about how the legislation should be applied. It would also create at least two potential loopholes in the protection measures. First, the farmer or landowner would be able to remove long stretches of hedgerow and claim that the work was not illegal because the whole hedgerow had not been removed. Secondly, clause 15(8) makes it clear that the operation of the de minimis limit exemption refers only to whole hedgerows. The amendment would mean that a farmer or landowner could remove a short stretch of hedge from the end of a hedgerow and claim that that was permitted because the stretch was less than 20 m long. In that way, a whole hedge could be removed in 20 m chunks, provided that one end was unattached.

Clause 16(2) provides that planning consent automatically overrides the Bill's provisions. A developer who obtains planning consent does not need to go through the notification procedure to remove hedges on any site.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was discussing permitted development rights under clause 16, which are important. Under the planning Acts, some development works are permitted if they are notified to the local planning authority first. Key permitted works for agricultural development include buildings of less than 365 sq m. It would be wrong, having notified the local planning authority of the permitted works—the authority would have the right to suggest amendments to those permitted works, which could include not removing a stretch of hedgerow—to impose an extra hurdle of going through the notification procedure under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to consider amendment No. 93 as it would eliminate another double administrative hurdle to which the unfortunate owners of hedgerows are being subjected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I have given the matter considerable thought. The amendment would extend the provision in clause 16(2). The Bill does not apply to anything which is done for the purposes of development authorised by planning permission, including development granted by a development order. There are some problems, which I shall explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill covers the isolated removal of hedgerows. Such removal does not fall within the meaning of development for the purposes of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and so does not require planning permission. But some planning proposals are bound to involve hedgerow removal. The planning process, which takes account of the impact of development on the environment, is well equipped to deal with such proposals. It is not necessary to impose a requirement on developers to put in a second application for the removal of hedgerows. My notification provisions are not designed to interfere with the normal process of applying for planning permission, and clause 16(2) makes that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the removal of hedgerows makes up part of a proposal that does not require full planning permission, local authorities should be notified under the Bill. Amendment No. 93 would extend clause 16(2) to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
include permitted development rights under the Town and Country (General Development) (Amendment) Order 1987. It would allow permitted development that does not require full planning permission to proceed without the need to notify, even if the proposal involves the destruction or impairment of hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general development order grants permit development rights to a wide range of operations in the countryside—for example, rights for various buildings, excavation or engineering operations for agricultural purposes. In some cases—for example, development involving new agricultural and forestry buildings^—planning permission cannot be exercised without prior application to the local planning authority for a determination on whether specific approval will be required for certain details, including siting. In many cases, there is no need for prior involvement by planning authorities.

It is not clear how often hedgerow removal would normally make up proposals to carry out permitted development. But it is clear that an unnecessary loophole would be created if permitted development involving the destruction of hedgerows could go ahead without notification. The requirement to notify would not be unduly onerous on farmers or developers. Permitted development that does not involve destruction of hedgerows will be able to proceed, but when such an operation is proposed it is prudent that the Bill should contain safeguard for valuable hedgerows, and within 28 days the applicant will know where he stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the weeks, the Committee has considered several amendments which would have created needless loopholes. Wherever practicable, I have resisted such amendments and have asked the Committee to do likewise. Last week, the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) explained to the Committee the problem of loopholes in legislation to protect badgers. He put his case very well by saying that "villainy is imaginative". I have constantly borne that in mind. I urge my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to may earlier remarks about making bad law? It seems that we are asking the rural community to bear the brunt of the Bill and it is unfair to create another double bureaucratic hurdle for it to overcome. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East consider that? He said that there are several permitted works. In order to alleviate the burden that would be inflicted by the clause, perhaps he would consider a similar amendment restricted to agricultural buildings. The rural community would regard that as fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of agricultural buildings under construction is comparatively small and affects only a minute fraction of the total hedges that are being removed. The agricultural community would see that as a gesture. If I consider withdrawing the amendment, will my hon. Friend consider a similar amendment on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly reflect on what my hon. Friend said. I do not accept, and I have tried to persuade the Committee to agree, that the clause

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
would place an undue burden on the rural community. I am anxious to avoid creating loopholes which would be exploited by unscrupulous operators. I know from experience in my constituency about people involved in the development of agricultural land whose motivation is not always as pure as the driven snow. I hope that those words give some comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East that his words are of little comfort. Under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the permitted works have to be notified to a local planning authority. It would be aware of what was going on. If it considered that a hedge came within the scope of the Bill by being of historic or landscape value, it would suggest to the applicant for permitted works that he should resite the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend does not want to help the agricultural community by amending the clause. On the basis that my hon. Friends and I shall want to return to this matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 94 in page 8, line 36, leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment would encourage local planning authorities to ensure that adequate provision would be made by attaching conditions to planning consent for development which would preserve the planting of hedgerows. The planning authority has powers to attach such conditions and, therefore, subsection (3) would be unnecessary. It would be otiose because its provision is covered by existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept my hon. Friend's argument. Although my hedgerow notification procedure should not be applied to the process of granting planning permission, I see no reason why the Bill should not flag up to local planning authorities the importance of hedgerows in the general scheme of development control. That is what clause 16(3) is all about. Let us consider an example from the law on tree preservation orders. The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 not only gives local planning authorities powers to make tree preservation orders but requires authorities to consider the desirability of imposing conditions when granting planning permission for the preservation or planting of trees. Clause 16(3) brings hedgerows into line with trees in that respect. It sends a clear message to local planning authorities that they must consider the importance of hedgerows when reconciling the familiar conflict between the need to encourage development and the need to protect the environment. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that it is better dealt with in guidance than by primary legislation, which already exists in any case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much hope that the guidance notes will touch on that, but, for the reasons that I have given, there is a case for including it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 8, line 38, leave out "or planting".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is almost the only subsection in the Bill where the word "planting" appears. I do not think that it was the original intention of the promoter of the Bill to encourage any positive management. He is primarily concerned to protect existing hedgerows. Therefore, to introduce the further concept of planting goes beyond the scope of the Bill. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East would explain why he thinks it necessary to included the word "planting".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why planning authorities should not have the same obligations in relation to the planting of hedgerows as they have in relation to the planting of trees. As part of the planning process, developers are encouraged to consider how their proposals will affect the landscape, wildlife habitats and historic features and to consider ways of building environmental improvements into their proposals. Clearly, tree planting is an accepted way of achieving that, but one should not underestimate the role of hedge planting, especially in the countryside. One example of where planting a hedgerow might be preferred to trees would be to screen an unsightly development. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree with me. We all know plenty of instances where we should like to see bushy hedgerows flourishing to cover up the misdeeds of mankind in the beauty of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the logic behind amendment No. 34 as the Bill is primarily about the protection of existing hedgerows rather than the planting of new ones. But I hope that I have satisfactorily explained the need for the provision in the wider context of development control. Local authorities already have the power to impose conditions requiring the planting of hedgerows when granting planning permission. The provision merely imposes a duty to consider whether such a power should be used. I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be very keen for general guidance to be provided to local authorities. That need not necessarily be guidance on this Bill, which might not be the appropriate place because the Bill deals with preservation of hedgerows, although it will give guidance on planting and replacements. Guidance to local authorities should suggest that, at times, planting of hedgerows and trees may be a suitable quid pro quo for some planning permissions, which they might not have been minded to grant without proper landscape conditions. I feel strongly that development in the countryside can take place if the design is right, if the materials used are correct and if the development is properly landscaped.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
I am conscious that many farmers and others are not obtaining planning permission in the countryside, although they may well deserve it, need it and it could be good for rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything that would encourage local authorities to consider the possibility of good landscaping, hedges and trees is to be encouraged. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is right. Merely inserting the amendment does not create a great wedge in the Bill and suggest that it is a Bill about planting hedges. It does not introduce any dangerous new concepts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister for that intervention because I have a great problem in my constituency where 80 per cent of the land is designated, in one way or another, for planning purposes.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 9, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(2A) The proper management of a hedgerow includes trimming, laying or coppicing."</p></q>
In the spirit of reasonableness, we have made good progress this morning and it looks as though we might finish—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sure, Mr. Hill, that you did not hear that sedentary remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. We previously discussed what constitutes the proper management of a hedge. It is a common misconception, as was proved by the earler discussion, that coppicing, or completely trimming off a shrubby or woody plant at its base, can be considered as proper management of a hedge. I know to my cost that many people, including, I suspect, local planning authorities, do not understand that. While I was carrying out a piece of management to a hedgerow, several motorists stopped and gave me abuse because they thought that I was deliberately destroying and removing that hedgerow. That practical example proves that it is necessary to include in the Bill an exact definition of proper management so that it is clear to not only members of the public but to the local planning authority. That will make matters easier, more workable and fair to those who must operate the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
Bill—farmers and the owners of hedgerows in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seems totally reasonable and I strongly hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury raised a fair point. The other day, I went out in the Isle of Wight with the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers who lay many hedges. That requires drastic action on the hedge, but when the work is completed, it is as pretty as a picture. If I might say so to my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, who is a farmer, it is much better visually than those wretched flail mowers that most farmers use these days, although we understand their reasons for doing so: labour costs are high and such mowers are labour-saving devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that many hedges on the Isle of Wight are regularly laid and treated in the traditional way by a team of volunteers. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury makes a fair point in his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury gives too little credit to local authorities' awareness of what constitutes proper management of a hedgerow. However, he appears to have a valid point in wanting more precise definitions of proper management. I look forward to hearing the views on this matter of the hon. Member for Surrey, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all have great sympathy with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is trying to make. As the Bill is currently worded, I do not see the need for the provision. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will have heard the comments of members of the Committee and, in the next couple of minutes, will reflect on the course of action to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend our guidance to be very specific on this point. As this seems to be a morning for anecdotal evidence and stories, I shall tell the Committee that, just before the Bill came into Committee, I visited an official hedgerow improvement scheme north of Luton, which was funded by the Countryside Commission. Some wonderful work was being carried out on an old, straggly, gappy hedge which had not been cut and laid for about 20 years. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury will know what I mean. The trunks at the bottom were about 6 in to 9 in in diameter. It would have been impossible to lay the hedge at that stage, as it was tall and straggly, covered in ivy, and was being strangled. The only proper management that could be carried out was to use a chainsaw to cut the stumps to about 6 in above ground level at a slope so that water could run off. That treatment had been carried out on the hedge two years ago. Just six weeks ago, all the shoots were starting to come out and a wonderfully rich, luxurious hedge was coming up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That treatment was carried out further inland, on the edge of the A45. Signs had to be put up explaining that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
an official government scheme was being carried out and that it constituted proper management, because of the abuse that workers were getting from ignorant—in the correct sense of the word—passers-by and motorists who, because the expert hedge-layer was using a chainsaw to cut the hedge, thought that it was being vandalised. That huge educational gap worries me considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the problem that the Minister has mentioned. Does he accept that, if we were to include such definitions in the Bill, a farmer or landowner would have the perfect response to such criticism? He would be able to say, "I'm acting in accordance with hedgerow protection law." If we leave this aspect as a matter for guidance, a farmer or landowner would not have such a strong defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has heard it and no doubt will reflect on it in deciding whether to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. The matter is too important to be left to guidance. The provision needs to be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend has said. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will reflect on that point as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter. Even if my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East were to accept the amendment, we would still need detailed guidance on exactly what was meant by coppicing, laying, and so on. Many people think that some aspects of coppicing are similar to rose pruning—one prunes a few shoots and hopes that the rest will come up. Where a hedgerow has been terribly overgrown, the whole works need to be cut back bare to the earth. We suggest that that should be done at the correct time of year, so that new growth is encouraged. I expect our guidance to be comprehensive and to take into account rural practices in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight impolitely pointed out last week, I was up a Bramley apple tree in Kent for a considerable time. Perched up there, I was able to see some of the wonderful hedgerow styles in Kent. Those hedgerows have been developed in order to protect the hop fields. There was not so much coppicing as poplaring, about 12 ft high. Rows of poplars were spaced about 2 ft apart. That factor would be taken into account in determining whether a hedge was formed. In this case, they were more like a row of closely packed trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I was concluding by saying that the lessons I learnt from being up a Bramley apple tree in Kent were that many different practices constitute proper hedgerow management. One would not want any farmer to cut bare to the ground or to coppice annually and destroy a hedge, or exhaust it—if that is possible—in the name of proper hedgerow management. In the guidance, we must give complete details of all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
practices and what we consider to be proper management. I shall leave it to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East to consider whether the amendment should be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would finish. Shall I make an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may intervene if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall happily conclude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very kind, Mr. Hill, because it gives me the opportunity to make one or two more points. The essence of Committee work is to produce legislation that is seen to be fair. I have returned to that theme many times. We have had a thoroughly good discussion during the sittings of the Committee, but we need to give the right signals, not only to the agricultural community which must put the Bill's provisions into practice, but to the general public. It is incumbent on us to show the general public that people who fairly operate the Bill are complying with its spirit. That is terribly important. If the public think that justifiable operations without the scope of the Bill—in other words, illegal operations—are being carried out, we are sending them the wrong signals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is terribly important that the words should be included in the Bill. I accept what the Minister has said. He will need to give comprehensive guidance elsewhere of exactly how coppicing and flailing should be carried out because, as he suggested, there is wide scope for abuse. The amendment is thoroughly sensible. Now that the hon. Member for Surrey, East has seen some clarity and light, let us hear what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest and considerable sympathy to what hon. Members have said. It is in no way the Bill's intention to prevent the normal good management of hedgerows, whatever "good management" may involve. I am well aware that in some cases—in the management of blackthorn hedgerows, for example—it is common to cut a hedge down to only a couple of inches, from which it grows back. I am anxious that that sort of practice should be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Committee to consider three points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the greatest threats to the countryside are townies who do not understand it and who do not comprehend traditional practices. That is one of the greatest problems in managing the countryside of the United Kingdom, especially given the greater mobility of the population. Before my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East makes his points, it may help him to know that, although I feel strongly about this matter and have that it will be possible to introduce an amendment on Report, I support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. Of course, farmers and landowners will be answerable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
not to townies but to local authorities. They will continue to have to put up with angry motorists shouting at them about good management practices. That unfortunate event will be unaffected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. Unless it is spelt out in the Bill, a general signal will be sent out from this place that all hedgerows are protected and that there can be no management of them. Hordes of people will rush off to their local planning authority to complain about the actions of farmers and landowners. The authority will have to say that those actions are not an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would save the local planning authorities a huge amount of unnecessary work. I cannot stress strongly enough that it would send out the right signal about the exact intention of the Bill, which, in general, is well thought out and warranted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to argue with my hon. Friend or other hon. Members, but there are three issues that should be considered by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, laying, coppicing and trimming will not always be good practice. Regular overtrimming and overcoppicing damages a hedgerow. That is more damaging than letting it be for 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second consideration is a legal point. By including specific management practices in the Bill, we are begging the question why other management practices are not named. My hon. Friend the Minister referred to regional practices which may have different names to those that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury wants to include in the Bill. That could be a problem, but not necessarily an insuperable one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the issue will be covered by guidance notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind all that has been said, I would be willing to reflect further on ways to incorporate in the Bill the spirit of what my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is trying to achieve. We need to be careful about accepting his amendment, particularly in light of the second reason that I gave. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment uses the word "includes". That does not preclude other aspects of proper management. On the basis that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will consider the matter carefully with a view to introducing amendments on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. You will recall that last week the Committee had a long discussion about clause 6. It was withdrawn because we believed that it was badly drafted, although we were not against the spirit of some of the provisions. In column 99 of 	<i>Hansard</i> last week, I raised a point of order about whether we could introduce a new clause following the decision to disagree to clause 6.
	<br><q><p>"Any Member can table a new clause."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E, 10March 1993; c. 99.</i>]</p></q>
I duly followed your advice and tabled a new clause. I am wondering whether it was not selected for debate because you consider that it is not materially different from clause 6. If so, may I respectfully submit, Mr. Hill, that it is significantly different? It would omit reference to ponds and farm buildings and should be debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman cannot challenge the Chair's selection.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill, I do not wish to impugn your decision not to select new clause 2, but I hope that it will be noted by the Committee, and especially by the promoter of the Bill, that it is clearly the consensus of the Committee that a replacement for clause 6 should be introduced at a later stage, whether or not it closely resembles new clause 2, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. I trust that we shall be able to debate such a new clause on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill, I thought that I had made it clear this morning that I intend to bring forward such a new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>(2) If the owner of the land fails to take the action required in subsection (1) above, he is guilty of an offence, and shall be liable to the penalties set out in section 4 above.".—[	<i>Mr. Chris Smith.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my hon. Friends I shall speak to the new clause very briefly, because I suspect that the hon. Member for Surrey, East does not wish to endorse it. The Bill aims to preserve hedgerows and control the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
grubbing up or damaging of hedgerows rather than ensure proper maintenance of hedgerows, but an enormous amount of hedgerow is lost through neglect rather than damage or destruction. Under the new clause, my hon. Friends tried to identify that issue and to provide a means of ensuring that action is taken against neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any requirement to ensure proper maintenance would need to be constructed in the context of clear guidelines on proper maintenance and would also have to be within the scope of any incentive scheme such as that which the Government have already introduced. The principle of ensuring good maintenance of hedgerows as well as protection from damage or destruction is important and worth putting before the Committee. It is crucial issue that may require further legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For my part, Mr. Hill I hope that your cough gets better soon. It has been most useful in keeping us in order, although I know it must be a great irritant to you.

I am obliged to Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, which conducted a detailed survey of hedgerows on the Isle of Wight and their loss during the past 20 years. As I said at the beginning of our proceedings, I am amazed at how many have been lost, having been content in the knowledge—I thought—that I represented a county constituency that was heavily hedge-rowed. That is an extraordinary fact of life and I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East for, I hope, putting the Bill on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight for those remarks. I thank him for his eloquent support in critical moments during our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the general sentiment behind new clause 1. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who tabled the new clause, and to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, who moved it, for making the point that good management of hedgerows is an important element in maintaining important features of our countryside. The Bill is directed simply at controlling the removal of important hedgerows. Its overriding principle is to keep that as straightforward as possible, with the minimum of burdens on all concerned, especially on landowners and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new clause would cause the Bill to deviate from those aims in several ways: first, local authorities would be given wide proactive powers which would have to be accompanied by matching rights of entry. I do not favour such a provision. Secondly, grants are already available for hedgerow man-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
agement through the hedgerow incentive scheme which was launched last year by my hon. Friend the Minister. In addition, there could be considerable disagreement over the interpretation of the words "properly maintained". I recognise that there are several grey areas in the Bill where there is room for difference of interpretation. For example, what is a hedgerow and what is a valuable hedge? Grey areas are almost inevitable but the Bill strives to keep them to a bare minimum and I suggest that we should not add more without a particularly good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the desire to maintain a light touch with the measures in the Bill and the fact that measures are already in place that are intended to improve the management of important hedgerows, I hope that members of the Committee will agree that the new clause, while motivated by the very best of intentions, is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since we have almost come to a conclusion and the new clause provokes an interesting new discussion, I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight and pay tribute to my predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the Bill's promoter, my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, who has performed a valuable service in allowing us to debate hedgerows and—before you, Mr. Hill, rule me out of order—the new clause in such detail. It is a pity that more members of the public do not see this side of our proceedings because we have had valuable debates, which have proved the tremendous detail in which Bills are considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East thinks that I have been a damn nuisance for moving so many amendments but I hope that—as I wrote in my note to him after the previous sitting—he recognises that a better Bill has been produced as a result of the amendments. I pay tribute to all members of the Committee. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight for his remarks and pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, who is not present but who helped me in moving the amendments. I also pay tribute to the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union, which have provided a huge amount of valuable advice.

I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East that new clause 1 is well outside the scope of the Bill. I am not sure whether, in every aspect of our discussions, my hon. Friend has operated with a light touch. However, I pay tribute to him for that sentiment and perhaps those words will return to haunt him on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My brief tells me that the new clause would provide a charter for over-zealous bureaucrats who would operate on the minimum of knowledge. It would not be sensible for the Committee to accept this clause, and I hope that hon. Members will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly use the new clause as a means of summing up the way in which

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
the Bill has been handled by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, my hon. Friend the Minister and by hon. Members on both sides of the argument and on both sides of the Committee? The probing motive behind the new clause, which was moved by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, exemplifies the spirit of co-operation that we have seen in the Bill. We are fond of probes in Committee as a means of testing the water to see whether we have got it right. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury has rightly battered the clause back a bit, but very gently. My hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Wight has introduced his customary little bit of eloquence and has referred to your superb chairmanship, Mr. Hill, not least by means of the use of your tactical cough which, I understand, has quelled even my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury should withdraw the new clause because it is going just a little too far. Of course, we are interested in ensuring good maintenance of hedgerows. That is what the Bill is all about. However, our aim is to find the most appropriate mechanism by which to achieve that objective. The Bill, as worded, will become a good Act. It does not need this additional bit of probing to become law at this stage. I hope that the spirit of this Committee will continue when the Bill leaves this upper Room and moves to the Floor of the House and on to another place. I wish it every success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept, of course, that the new clause goes somewhat beyond the general tenet of the Bill. As such, it is probably inappropriate to press it. However, the issue of hedgerow maintenance and the loss of hedgerow through neglect rather than damage will be one to which, in due course, we shall have to return. The new clause is a means of flagging up the issue and of reminding ourselves that we shall need to bear it in mind as time progresses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how remarkably convivial the Committee has been? Good humour has been splattered all over the place, and I do not attribute that humour to the birds and the bees. I know that there is a great interest in hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. It would be appropriate at this stage, before we finally finish our proceedings, to place on record our gratitude to you for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings and have kept us in excellent order and good humour throughout. I also thank the Clerk and the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff for their work in assisting our deliberations and the police, who have guarded our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay particular tribute to the hon. Member for Surrey, East. It is a rare privilege for an hon. Member, especially a new hon. Member, to guide a Bill through the complex intricacies of the Committee procedure. The hon. Gentleman has done so with great skill and enormous competence. I pay tribute to him not only for selecting this topic for his private Member's Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
which is very important, but for the way in which he has brought the Bill to its present stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that we have not left too many hostages to be dealt with on Report because, as with all private Member's Bills, there will be the problem of vying for time. We all want the Bill to reach the statute book and I hope that we shall approach the Report stage with that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill, I endorse, with great brevity—my eye is on the clock—everything that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, especially his final comments. We must all hope that the gaps in the hedgerow are not so substantial that they will create loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who were worried that the length of speeches might be in direct relation to the length of hedgerows were relieved by the brevity with which our proceedings were expeditiously dealt with. The Bill will clearly be an important Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the hon. Gentleman in thanking you, Mr. Hill, and the team in the Committee. I congratulate the hon. Member for Surrey, East and wish him God's speed in the remaining stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, I did not thank you, Mr. Hill. Our proceedings have been illuminating for me as a new Member and I thank you for your forebearance on my inadequate knowledge of how Committees operate. I assure you that I have greater knowledge now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the Clerk who provided very useful personal advice to me and my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I thank the Minister for his clear guidance and I urge him to continue to provide that when the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already thanked my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill and I echo the sentiments that have been expressed about his handling of the Bill in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. I, too, pay tribute to your excellent chairmanship of the Committee, which was conducted with your customary good humour. You admonished my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury for trying to introduce maps into our deliberations because they could not be reported by 	<i>Hansard,</i> I look forward to studying how 	<i>Hansard</i> reports your tactical cough. Presumably it will appear as an interruption. If so, it will be one of the few interruptions in the House which have expedited proceedings. It has been a privilege to serve on the Committee with you and I pay tribute to your excellent team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Primarily, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East for his incredibly skilful handling of what has turned out to be a slightly more complicated Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
than we anticipated. We all agreed that its aim is clear and we all recognised we want to protect hedgerows, but some of the legal concepts have been much more difficult than many of us anticipated. I am also grateful to my hon. Friends for pointing out when the Bill could be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East for agreeing to consider those points and to return on Report with a Bill that has been improved in Committee and will be further improved on Report. I am grateful that I shall not be sitting in my hon. Friend's seat with a Bill that is more complicated that we anticipated. It is to his eternal credit that, as a new Member, he has selected an important matter and dealt with it more efficiently than many Ministers would have done, and I place myself in that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill, I am becoming overwhelmed by the comments of hon. Members. I echo everything that has been said about your chairmanship, which has been exemplary. I said at the beginning of our proceedings that I hoped that you would cast a firm but benign eye over our discussions. You have done so in the most agreeable way, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to the police, the 	<i>Official Report</i> and the Clerk for the time that they have given, which we did not anticipate would be so long when we first met a month ago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been longer than all of us anticipated, except my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight who made his own inimitable contribution to our examination of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
I also thank the officials at the Department of the Environment who from time to time threw me a life line and provided enlightenment, inspiration and technical advice. I am deeply indebted to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that it is a rare privilege to have the honour of trying to pilot a private Member's Bill through Committee and that is so. It has been a great honour and a rapid learning curve. It may also have been a rapid learning curve for my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham. All three of us are new Members and we have learnt a lot from our discussions. I hope that we shall be able to put that to good effect in the months and years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon Member for Islington, South and Finsbury for his unfailingly constructive and intelligent approach to our discussions, which I know that all hon. Members appreciate. I also thank the Liberal Democrat representative for his comments on the concerns of people in his part of the country. Finally, I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his sound counsel and guidance, especially at moments of stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that all members of the Committee have attended on a voluntary basis. The attendance today seems to have been somewhat coppiced, layered or trimmed, which is not surprising as we have enexpectedly had a fourth sitting. I am grateful to all members of the Committee for a constructive, fair-minded and helpful series of debates and I believe that we have all contributed towards progress in achieving the long overdue measures that are necessary to protect our country's most valuable hedgerows from the ever-increasing onslaught that is being wreaked upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
