	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 4, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) An Order made under subsection (1) above shall be revoked in the case where subsection (4)(a) above is no longer satisfied.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 182, in page 4, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) An Order made under subsection (1) above shall be revoked in the case where subsection (4)(b) above is no longer satisfied,'.</p></blockquote>
No. 183, in clause 248, page 141, line 18, leave out '7,'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 would allow parliamentary scrutiny of a decision by the Secretary of State to make an order under clause 7. Amendent No. 183 would provide flexibility so that if circumstances changed and an order was no longer appropriate, it could be revoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 would enable Parliament to investigate and to consider the reasons for, and the motives behind, a decision to make an order. The Minister has suggested that the 10 per cent. entry figure does not automatically trigger the introduction of the funding agency: there is flexibilty at the edges. He said last week that an order under clause 7 would be invoked by the Secretary of State only when it was appropriate. We have had no guidance about what factors the Secretary of State will take into account to help him decide whether an order is appropriate. In the light of that vagueness, Parliament should be able to scrutinise the Secretary of State's decision to use those powers. It would help the Committee, and the House at a later stage, to know what those factors are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a transfer of responsibility and power from a democratically elected LEA to the Secretary of State. Such a development causes Opposition Members great concern. It is unusual to take away powers from a democratically elected body without giving Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the Secretary of State's decisions. Through the negative resolution procedure, Parliament should be able to investigate the reasons for, and the circumstances surrounding, the Secretary of State's decision to use his powers under clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are similar situations. As a result of the reforms in the national health service, if powers are transfered from a district health authority—which is not a democratically
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
elected or accountable body—to an NHS trust, the procedure is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. When responsibility for the provision of education is transferred from a publicly accountable elected body, to the Secretary of State and then to the funding agency there should be similar parliamentary scrutiny of the procedure. Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 would provide parliamentary scrutiny of the Secretary of State's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 183 arises from our recognition of the fact that that it may be necessary in certain circumstances to change a decision to invoke clause 7. We are aware that school populations are not fixed; they change when, for example, the local population increases or decreases. The 10 per cent. trigger brings in the funding agency, but what will happen if the figure falls below 10 per cent? For example, if a school is closed because of falling rolls, instead of 11 per cent. of pupils in the secondary sector being educated in grant-maintained schools, there may be only 9 per cent. There appears to be no power in the Bill for the clause 7 order to be revoked. It would be appropriate to give such a power if the figure falls below 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that there will soon be another period of local government reorganisation. The Government have stated that they intend to reorganise the county councils and the shire districts with a view to establishing unitary authorities. That will affect the education service, which is at present delivered by the county councils. In an existing county council area, more than 10 per cent. of pupils may be in the grant-maintained sector. When unitary authorities are established, however, less than 10 per cent. of secondary or primary pupils in the district authority area may be in that sector. The Bill gives no flexibility to revoke the introduction of the funding agency in those areas where fewer than 10 per cent. of pupils are in grant-maintained schools. That will be a real possibility if the LEAs in England are reorganised as a result of the introduction of unitary authorities in the present county councils. Boundaries will be established and new education authorities will be set up within the county council areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By acknowledging the possibility that such changes will be made and that it may be necessary to revoke a clause 7 order, the amendments would improve a bad Bill. We are trying to be constructive as we move towards Christmas and I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments in that spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments probe the extent to which the Minister believes his own rhetoric about parental choice. They investigate how far the Secretary of State is prepared to bend to parents' wishes in reversing the 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. triggers that are set out in clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 per cent. trigger applies when an LEA moves from phase 1 to phase 2. The responsibility for planning provision is then shared by the LEA and the funding agency. The 10 per cent. of children who attend grant-maintained schools could be reduced by demographic or boundary changes. The second trigger applies when 75 per cent. of pupils are in the grant-maintained sector. The funding agency then assumes entire responsibility for the provision of places in the area. If the 75 per cent. is reduced, would the Secretary of State reverse the decision and would the school return to phase 2?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
I shall give examples of how conditions in an LEA area could change from those that imposed the trigger. We should consider carefully what will happen when local government boundaries are changed and unitary authorities are introduced. I have spent a long time talking about my county and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cambridgeshire, more than 10 per cent. of schools have opted out of LEA control. That has happened in many Conservative-controlled local authorities. However, in my constituency, not a single school has opted out. None is likely to do so. It has been proposed that Cambridge city should become one of the new unitary authorities. It does not take much imagination to envisage that the funding agency for schools will share responsibility with Cambridgeshire LEA because more than 10 per cent. of schools in the county have opted out. However, when the new unitary authority is established, not a single school within it will be grant maintained. All the schools will be under LEA control, yet the responsibility for planning and providing places will be shared with a remote funding agency that has nothing to do with the schools. That is not democratic and does not provide parents with the choice that the Minister claims to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some LEAs will converge on a boundary just below the 10 per cent. or 75 per cent. triggers, through demographic change or parents who choose to send their children to schools in different areas. If parents exercise that choice, it is inevitable that some will move their children from one school to another. If that means that pupils move across LEA boundaries, the percentage of children in grant-maintained schools in an authority could change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Bill enable parents to choose to be in or out of an authority which shares responsibility with the funding agency? Real parental choice would mean allowing parents of pupils at grant-maintained schools to vote for the return to LEA administration, if they so wish. A vote taken by one set of parents should not be binding on future sets of parents who may come along in five or 10 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is supposed to plan the future of education for the next 20 or 25 years. In 10 years' time—even in five years' time—parents may have a different view about their school from the parents who are taking such decisions and voting today. If we are to preserve that choice, it is important that a new cohort of parents should have the same choice as those parents who took the original decision. What is important is not the views of parents whose children used to attend the schools but the views of those who have children at the schools. If schools choose to return to LEA control, that could change the character of an LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Lady's argument closely. She seems to be proposing that a school that has opted out should have the right to opt back into the LEA control. If that school decided to opt-out again, as a new cohort of parents come in, would not the uncertainties created make such a system untenable? For that reason, the amendment should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I find that argument difficult to follow. At the moment, there is great uncertainty in schools, when parents are coming up to a ballot. I believe that it would be necessary to impose a time constraint between ballots to ensure that parents would not have to take such a difficult decision on a year-in, year-out basis because it would be very disruptive. If the Government believe what they say about parental choice, parents should be given the right to opt-in as well as to opt-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been talking of three ways in which the conditions that originally set the figure could change: first, if LEA boundaries changed; secondly, if there were demographic changes or movements across boundaries of parent who chose to send their children to a different area; and thirdly, if parents were given the choice of opting back into LEA control, which would alter the percentage within the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are eminently sensible and would greatly increase real parental choice, which is what the Opposition believe in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments address some of the problems that have been mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). The Minister left for lunch in a rather bad mood. I have been watching him with great interest since we returned from lunch and his manner seems to have improved somewhat. I am sure that he will not be offended by what I shall say about the Government's attitude so far. They have used two strategies to oppose our amendments: the first is to reject them because they do violence to the Bill; the second is to reject them because they are covered elsewhere in the Bill and, therefore, in the words of the Minister, are unnecessary. The Minister will find it difficult to argue either of those defences in this case because the amendments are offering the Goverment practical solutions to real problems. The Minister nods, so that maybe an indication that, on this occasion, he will see the benefit of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Want a bet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has asked me if I want to bet. I am not a betting man, so I shall leave it to the Minister to tell the Committee the way in which he feels about the three amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 183 to clause 248 would cause orders placed under clause 7(1) to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That is essential when we consider the creation and involvement of the funding agency for schools in a given local authority area. There is always room for more parliamentary scrutiny, but the amendment would require Parliament's approval for the introduction of the funding agency for schools. The statutory requirement in clause 248 would mean that the matter would be the subject of a report to Parliament. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said, it would be subject also to a negative vote in the House of Commons. That would allow some control by Parliament over the provision of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the funding agency for schools is introduced—when 10 per cent. of the school population in an area has achieved grant-maintained status—it will play a role in the provision of sufficient educational places and in the planning for sufficient school places in that area. Opposition Members have said that that is a recipe for chaos and that it will be divisive. I think that the Bill is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
designed to be divisive and to be destructive in its operation. The creation of the funding agency for schools to replace the role of the democratically elected local authority in the provision of sufficient school places needs to be considered carefully. Therefore, it is essential that the establishment of the funding agency for schools, under clause 7(1), should be subject to an order requiring approval by Parliament. As even the Under-Secretary of State for Schools recognises, anomalies already exist in the 10 per cent. trigger for the introduction of the funding agency for schools. That anomaly could involve school pupils who live in a different local authority area. The Minister did not give a satisfactory answer to an earlier amendment on that matter, when it was made clear that, if grant-maintained status were to be granted to the Jewish free school in Camden, the funding agency for schools would be established in an area in which the necessary 10 per cent. requirement had not been fulfilled by parents who live in Camden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliamentary scrutiny would allow such matters to be considered. For example, schools that have become grant-maintained applied for that status without realising that the Government intended that the funding agency for schools would take over the democratic role of local authorities. I am not sure whether that was part of a hidden agenda that was up the Government's sleeve all along, or whether the Government came up with the idea after they began to draft the Bill. However, schools that have become grant maintained were unaware of the implications that their choice would have for the democratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools will bring the end of the LEAs, but we must consider also the 75 per cent. demise or guillotine figure for the role of the local authority in the provision of sufficient school places in its area. The amendment would make that 75 per cent. figure, along with the establishment of the funding agency, subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The amendment would bring a useful dimension to the Bill. It would also mitigate the problem caused by the loss of democratic control through local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 per cent. threshold may be reached in the latter days of this Parliament. The 75 per cent. threshold, when LEAs will no longer be responsible for the provision of sufficient school places, may also be reached. Therefore, if an order had to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, it might be many years before Parliament would have that control and would be able to weigh up the factors in a detached way and judge the orders in the light of events. That would be good for parliamentary democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that if the 75 per cent. threshold is reached, a body that has been in existence for over 50 years and has stood the test of time will no longer be required. LEAs have been responsible for the provision of local education, but when the 75 per cent. threshold is reached, their role will end. We need to consider the matter further to ensure that that is what Parliament intends. The amendment to clause 248 would make such a decision subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That emphasises the importance of that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 would introduce a two-way street. Current Government policy on education is a one-way street. At best, it provides a conveyor belt to take schools into the grant-maintained sector. In the White Paper the Government stated:
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is right that the route to GM status should remain the parental ballot. However, the Government firmly believes that self-government is best for state schools and remains fully committed to the advancement of this end."</p></blockquote>
The Government have a blinkered view and see only a one-way street. Amendments Nos. 181 and 182 would introduce a two-way street. The Bill provides a one-way ticket: if a parental ballot is successful, schools can apply for grant-maintained status and by and large such applications will be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make a slight diversion. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge referred earlier to the possibility of holding another ballot to allow schools that have opted out to go back under LEA control. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) is unfortunately not present; he is posting his Christmas cards. He has a cold so I am glad that I am not on his mailing list because I have just seen him licking the stamps and the envelopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, there will be uncertainty until a school applies to opt out, and then there will be no way back. The amendments introduce a two-way street. The need for the funding agency may disappear. For instance, 10 per cent. of the school population may be in grant-maintained schools but because of the demographic changes to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge referred, that figure may fall below 10 per cent. However, the funding agency would still be in place. The amendments would allow the Secretary of State to dismantle the funding agency in that LEA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my local authority, Cheshire county council, there is no overall control. There is a Labour minority administration, or to be more accurate, it is run by a triumvirate of the three party leaders—the leaders of the Labour group, the Liberal Democrat group and the Conservative group. There have been very few applications for grant-maintained status. I am aware of two, made by schools threatened with closure, both of which were successful. We have debated whether that will apply in the future and I do not intend to cover those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, eight districts in Cheshire have made it clear that they would like to see unitary authorities when the local government commissioner arrives in Cheshire to carry out the third tranche of his review. The funding agency may by then be operating in parts of Cheshire, but some of the districts may not have any grant-maintained schools. We need a mechanism for the new LEAs, created under unitary status, to be able to say that it is their responsibility to provide, under statute, sufficient places for those aged five to 16. The amendments would allow that to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 per cent. trigger to bring in the funding agency operates too early and the 75 per cent. trigger, which is the guillotine to remove LEAs from the provision of education, comes in too soon. They are arbitrary figures. However, if we accept the amendments, Parliament would decide whether that is what it wants. That is good for democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need the mechanism to allow the disestablishment of the funding agency in LEAs for further simple reasons. For example, in the new town area in my constituency, some schools may choose to opt out and may be given grant-maintained status. The number may reach the 10 per cent. trigger for the introduction of the funding agency, but because my area is growing, local authority school provision may have to expand. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
may be an increase in the number of pupil places provided by the LEA and, if those places are filled, the 10 per cent. trigger may be undermined. The result would be that only 9, 8, or 7 per cent. of pupils would be in grant-maintained schools. However, the funding agency would be in existence because at an historic point it was allowed to assume its parallel, but not shared, responsibility for education. The mechanism that the amendments would establish would allow the Secretary of State, with the approval of Parliament, to undo the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider another scenario. In an LEA in which schools have decided to opt out and the 10 per cent. trigger has been reached, there may be falling rolls. The number of pupils attending grant-maintained schools may fall. It may even mean that a grant-maintained school is forced to close because of falling rolls in an inner-city area. Again, the number of places may fall below the 10 per cent. threshold. Therefore, there must be a mechanism to introduce a level playing field and the Secretary of State must have the power to return to the LEA the responsibilities that are its under the Bill. The amendments, by subjecting the matter to parliamentary approval, would achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to introduce such a mechanism. It will allow the Secretary of State the opportunity to consult Parliament about educational changes. That is no bad thing. I am sure that the Secretary of State has nothing to hide from saying to Parliament that he intends to make an order under section 7(1) that would introduce the funding agency, remove LEAs from the provision of places or recognise that changes in those areas have taken place and revoke the introduction of the funding agency. It is right for the Secretary of State to come before Parliament and state that changes have taken place in a given area and that he seeks parliamentary approval to carry out the actions previously described. The Secretary of State should have nothing to fear from subjecting such a test to Parliament. We are all parliamentarians committed to parliamentary democracy and the amendment would allow Members of Parliament to put a case for or against an order. It would strengthen the Bill, which has not got a lot going for it, if the amendments were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These important mechanisms would introduce checks and balances into the Bill. The Minister looks far more relaxed than he did this morning: I hope that he has taken account of our arguments and will respond positively to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Wallsend appears to be getting desperate. He claimed that his amendments were practical and realistic, which goes beyond all previous Opposition claims. However, I am prepared to consider the amendments on that basis. In a moment of true desperation, the hon. Gentleman invoked the spirit of Christmas—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are surrounded by Christmas cards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, it was appropriate as we are surrounded by Christmas cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come clean with the Committee: I must disappoint Opposition Members yet again for several reasons. First, I concede the need for the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
to have a revocation power, for reasons that hon. Members gave. However, their research assistants have let them down; they should have examined the Education Act 1944, so beloved of Opposition Members, which gives me great pleasure to quote in a spirit of approval. Section 111 states:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>"Revocation and variation of orders and directions</i></p>
	<p>Any order made or directions given by the Secretary of State for Education or a local education authority under the provisions of this Act may be varied or revoked by a further order or further directions made or given by the Secretary of State as the case may be."</p>
	<p>Detailed provisions are then given. The power of revocation is already available to the Secretary of State under the 1944 Act.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the revocation powers under the 1944 Act are subject ot parliamentary scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they would not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. They provide that the procedures for revocation mirror those for making the order. If an order was subject to consultation so will be its revocation. There is an element of protection which may console Opposition Members; I shall return to the subject in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not as familiar with the 1944 Act as some of my hon. Friends. Does the revocation also apply to parental ballots? Is it the case that once a school has voted to opt out of local authority control, that decision can be revoked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is a different matter. The hon. Lady would, I am sure, be horrified if the Secretary of State could override the views of parents. There are safeguards: measures can be taken if a ballot is found to be faulty or is voided, but that is not what the hon. Lady means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister. He must be confused; I cannot believe that he is intentionally misleading the Committee. My understanding of section 11 of the Education Act 1944 is that it gives a power to the Secretary of State to revoke an order that the holder of that office may previously have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments require the Secretary of State to revoke an order if 4(A) or 4(B) are no longer satisfied. That is why the amendments are so important. I take the point that the Secretary of State has a discretionary power to revoke under section 111, but the amendments would require him to revoke in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the second leg of my argument—it is the reason why I oppose the amendment. Opposition Members said how important it was in the event of changing circumstances to have the power to revoke, and I agreed. I shall return to that point in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now going on to argue that the very point that the hon. Gentleman just made is a reason for the Committee to reject the amendments. It would not be sensible slavishly to adhere to the policy of making the revocation prescriptive, so that where some change took place and numbers fell marginally below one of the trigger points, there would be an automatic reversion of the arrangements. If Labour Members think about it for a moment they will see that that would not be helpful to the continuing local education authority role or to the funding agency role, or to the schools, pupils, teachers or anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
It will be bad enough for everybody to have to adjust to the changes that will inevitably take place as the grant-maintained sector grows. It will not be in the interests of education, or of those participating in the education process, to incorporate in the Bill an automatic reversion, upon one of the changes described by Labour Members taking place, to the previous status—phase 2 to 1, or 3 to 2, to use the shorthand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal specifically with a point about local government reorganisation? After the introduction of unitary authorities, there may be no grant-maintained schools in a particular area, but there would be a new LEA, which would not share responsibility with the funding agency as envisaged in the Bill. Will the Minister be happy with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but there will be enough flexibility to deal with it. Labour Members seem to know much more than I do about what is in the mind of Sir John Banham. They seem to have an inside track, to which I am not privy, on the reorganisation of local government. I concede that there may, in years to come, be changes in local government, some of which may, for all I know, be quite substantial. Were substantial boundary changes to take place it would be for the Secretary of State to take a view on whether the developing arrangements under the existing boundaries and dispositions were appropriate. The revocation power might well be brought into play at that stage. That is allowed for by section 111 of the 1944 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between parliamentary scrutiny of this procedure and parliamentary scrutiny of some of the others that were prayed in aid by Opposition Members. We have calculated that there could be 436 such statutory instruments if we followed the course suggested in the amendment. They could come in very quick succession if grant-maintained status caught on. I do not think that Opposition Members would want or expect 436 statutory instruments to be presented in rapid succession so that there could be parliamentary scrutiny of a procedure that, after all, is laid down explicitly in the Bill and, is well known to parents who are participating in ballots, and to all those involved in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Warrington, South that parliamentary scrutiny would add a valuable overlay to the process. The process—the balloting, the trigger points and all the rest—is very clear as it is. It makes little sense to give the House an opportunity to overturn the result of a parental ballot—which is presumably what is in Opposition Members' minds. It certainly makes no sense in relation to the numbers suggested by our calculations. I do not agree that that measure would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members asked what factors might be taken into account when deciding whether to make or revoke an order. I would have in mind, for example, any changes known to be imminent in the structure of provision in the area. For example, if it were known that an existing grant-maintained school were to be closed, and the pupils were to be transferred to an LEA school for some reason, it would be taken into account. The Secretary of State's decision would be affected—to take up a point made by Opposition Members—if it were known that there were to be changes in local education authority boundaries. It could also be affected—this is important and relates to a previous amendment—if genuine doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
existed as to whether the trigger point had been reached. We should admit that, sometimes, there will be legitimate discussion about the figures and whether the trigger point has been reached. The Secretary of State will listen to such representations; whether by the LEA or schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brief statement helps the Committee. In the light of this morning's debate, does the Minister accept that the issue of non-residents who attend schools in a specific area is relevant and should be taken into account when deciding whether to activate the trigger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Committee has decided to accept the approach that is set out in the Bill and to reject the residency qualification. I would not expect the Secretary of State to rake over that ground or to question the validity of the figures on that criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warrington deployed the one-way street argument. I tried to think of a parallel. The provision for council house sales was also a one-way street, but that did not decrease its popularity. It did not prevent more than a million people from taking up the Government's provision for buying council houses, although they knew that it was a one-way street. Parents are balloting now. Since the White Paper was issued in July, parents have balloted with full knowledge of its contents. Schools that have balloted positively since July cannot claim that they do not know about the regime in which they will participate. I concede that schools that balloted before July did not have that knowledge, but I am sure that they realised that grant-maintained schools could not operate in a vacuum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In parts of my constituency, one in 10 of the houses that were bought from the council have been repossessed. What would happen of one in 10 grant-maintained schools could not run themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If schools could not run themselves, they would be candidates for closure. If they were failing schools, we might wish to use other procedures that the Bill provides. If such schools could not run themselves, whatever that means, and we could not find satisfactory new governors and the headmasters were unable to cope, the schools could close. I cannot understand the parallel between repossessed council houses and schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not a parallel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful. It is not my fault if the Opposition do not wish to be helped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that, if a grant-maintained school cannot look after its own affairs and finances, repossession by a LEA is an appropriate option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not provide for that incorrect route. There are methods to help a grant-maintained school to find a way back to rectitude and good management. We shall consider them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill includes a revocation power. The amendments are too proscriptive. A mandatory submission of the process to the statutory instrument procedure would be unhelpful. For those reasons, and to retain flexibility, the Committee should reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill and its mechanisms are fatally flawed. I make no bones about that. My hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
Member for Warrington, South said that we could make the Bill better. I agree with him on a great deal, but differ from him in feeling that we could make the Bill less harmful. The distinction is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried philosophically about the amendment because of the concept of democracy in the Secretary of State's heart. Democracy is a tender plant which needs nurturing. When we set up mechanisms, we must be careful that they do not militate against the very democracy that we seek to defend throughout the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's argument about the potentially large number of statutory instruments would not be helpful to Parliament, but would increase hon. Member's work load rather than allow more debate about democratic principles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. No matter what the burden, democracy has to carry it. No matter how difficult the task, democrats have to face it. That is particularly true of members of the Committee. I wonder about the Bill's mechanics, how they will be put in place and how they will be democratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suspicious of the funding agency. This creature will have certain planning powers when the 10 per cent. threshold is reached. I am still not entirely clear about what the planning powers will be. They will be powers to grasp this and to take that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such is my hon. Friend's onslaught on the Minister over his inability to explain the funding agency's planning powers that it is throwing him into a veritable fit of depression. My hon. Friend should slacken off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister. Nevertheless, democracy compels us to tell him the harsh facts of life, such as the fact that the funding agency is a curious creature which is not being properly defined. It is poised, like some mythical beast, to gobble up us and our democracy. For example, do we have enough people with sufficient ability, time and interest to make up the governing bodies under the funding agencies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is in danger of anticipating the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not, Sir John. Boards of Governors are free-standing bodies subject to the funding agencies which are subject to the Secretary of State. There is little democratic control. In the appointment of governors, the minority are voted for and the majority are appointed. That is why parliamentary scrutiny is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area I cannot detect the contribution to the life of a school by governing bodies with business people and trade unionists on them. However, trade unionists and industrialists make important contributions to other governing bodies. We must consider the sum of that, for which we need the parliamentary scrutiny that can only come through the amendments. I do not deny that parliamentary scrutiny of such matters will be extremely difficult. It will be a harsh task. We may have to establish a special committee that can examine that. The fact that it will not be easy does not mean that we should not do it. Few things that we do or should do in this life are easy, but that does not mean that we should not face up to and overcome difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
Let me take a picaresque stroll along the Minister's memory lane to examine his arguments. The implication of what he said was that he viewed the Secretary of State as a vice-regal figure. One could even take the vice out of that and be left with a monarch ruling on his or her own in future. I should be delighted if my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) were to preside over that, but I should still subject her to democratic scrutiny. Moreover, she would have it no other way. That is her testimony to democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the devolution and trust involved in the body that the Secretary of State will establish. Like the Minister I shall use parallels, such as the road safety planning committes—one cannot get more local than those—in which fierce political battles take place. They have to be reined in by district and county councils because they promote chaos in their local areas instead of providing the helpful planning assistance that is needed. I envisage that happening with such a structure and this is our last chance to rein it in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend was correct to say that the proposals are practical and realistic. The Minister read out passages from the 1944 Act quite beautifully. I congratulate him on his tone. It was good to hear such lovely mid-1940s English, with its peculair style which we on the Opposition Benches enjoy. However, he did not refer to the democratic parliamentary scrutiny that we want. The Secretary of State may be able to make an order, but we want to be able to negate that procedure. He could revoke the grant-maintained status of a particular school, but we, as parliamentarians, might be persuaded by an impassioned plea from the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, for example—who has an interest in the matter—to override him. We should have that important power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Minister's difficulty over the words "shall" and "should" because, as a Minister must, he follows every word of the Secretary of State. The article that the Secretary of State wrote for 	<i>The Tablet</i> earlier this year shows that the right hon. Gentleman himself has difficulty in distinguishing between "shall" and "should", for which it is possible to have corrective lessons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the important changes in local government, we are so sure about what will happen that we need parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that our children's education does not slip through the net of local government reform. It is all very well for the Minister to say that we must have a peculiar insight into what will happen; the boasts and condemnations of the Minister at the Department of the Environment have given us a clear idea of that. It will be a sad day for education if unitary authorities sweep away the powers of county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in a district which has responsibility for education and, within its means, it does the job extremely well. But the wider diversity that would be provided by a larger authority is important and would add a crucial dimension to our children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have travelled along one-way and two-way streets. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) quite rightly used council house sales as an analogy. Every day council houses are repossessed because of people's inability to meet their mortgage commitments. That happens increasingly in Hemsworth because of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
area's growing unemployment. Council houses are willingly being sold back to a council which is strapped for cash and finds it difficult to buy them back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a two-way process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said, the same thing happens with schools. Failing schools in the grant-maintained sector will be particularly difficult to rescue if the local education authorities have been emasculated. It is the LEAs which have so far rescued and made work a number of the Government's half-baked educational theories. They may well be called upon again to rescue this sector. The LEAs should be kept strong, otherwise there will be no democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the parents who voted before the funding agency proposal was introduced must have known that the schools would be covered by some other structure. That is right, but the parents did not know about this half-baked idea. A half-baked idea such as this requires democratic control. The amendment would begin the process of ensuring that, no matter what the difficulty. I hope that the Minister will have second thoughts and accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has disappointed many members of the Committee by his refusal to accept this modest, practical and realistic amendment. We see nothing wrong in imposing a firm requirement on the Secretary of State to revoke an order when the 75 per cent. or 10 per cent. provisions are no longer appropriate. It would be helpful if the Bill contained guidelines for deciding whether it was appropriate to make an order. If the Secretary of State were to be able to reverse an order, such flexibility would have to be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that he wants to be flexible. A flexible friend was not terribly helpful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but it could be useful to the school system. We are facing a one-way street out of the LEA into the grant-maintained sector. There is no possibility of going in the reverse direction—that is what the Minister is telling us by refusing to accept the amendments. I have no doubt that we have won the argument, but I would not want to embarrass the Minister by winning the vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I owe the Under-Secretary of State for Schools an apology because this morning I said that the Government have not accepted any Opposition amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accepted the spirit of two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my absence, he accepted the spirit of two amendments, so I owe him an apology. He also referred to me as the hon. Member for Warrington. I am the Member of Parliament for Warrington, South. Warrington as a constituency ceased to exist in 1983 and I would not want him to confuse me with my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Mr. Hoyle), although I am sure that he would not be offended by the Minister's reference. My constituency covers other parts of Cheshire, including Runcorn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 deals with the needs of individual pupils. It follows a different tack from that of clause 7, which dealt with the role of the funding agency. Pupils who are permanently excluded from school have an urgent educational need for a new school place. Clause 8 relates to finding a place in a particular area and line 18 states that the authority must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied in relation to each school in the area"</p></blockquote>
for which it is responsible. The clause also refers to the distances involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the word "area" and substitute the words "geographical vicinity". That is an important change which would help the Government with the problem of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The longer that pupils are out of school, the more difficult it is for them to be reintegrated when they return. Many GCSE options consist of 100 per cent. course work, and the longer that fourth-year pupils are out of school, the more difficult it is to get back to that course work and the more unlikely it is that the curriculum will be suited to their needs. It is fundamental to pupils' well being that they return to school as soon as possible. That is why the amendment specifies "geographical vicinity" rather than "area".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has three motivating factors: first, the clause as drafted is at best ill defined and at worst deliberately wide and vague. The amendment would establish precisely what is meant by the word "area" in clause 8. It would clarify that concept by substituting the words "geographical vicinity", which would mean that that area is more closely related to the local schools which pupils have the right to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
Secondly, the notion of the funding agency having parallel, but not shared, responsibilities with the LEA causes problems. At a previous sitting, the Minister said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the parallel responsibilities operate in precisely this way: the funding agency for schools will have overall planning responsibilities for new schools, provision of places and closures in its sector, and the LEAs will have continuing responsibility in theirs".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 393.]</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the concept of "area" covers two distinct responsibilities: the LEA and the funding agency will be responsible for the schools in its respective area. That could be very confusing if we were talking about actual geographical areas, as the Minister said on 1 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third motivating factor is the need of pupils to be educated locally. One of most important provisions of the Children Act 1989 was the paramountcy principle, which stated that the needs of the child were paramount. I believe that one of the paramount needs of children is to be educated locally, or as close to their home as is possible if they have special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 specifies an appropriate authority, which I presume can be either the funding agency for schools or the LEA. In the case of an LEA, does the area referred to in clause 8 mean the whole of the LEA area? If so, there is a problem with the rest of the clause because shire county LEAs cover vast areas. The shire county in my constituency goes all the way from the River Dee estuary to north of the River Mersey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the case that the clause as drafted would mean that a local authority would have to search throughout its area for a place to accommodate a permanently excluded pupil, the formal mechanism that comes into operation after the informal approaches to schools that immediately follow the permanent exclusion of a pupil could mean that such a pupil would be offered to a school as far north as Great Sankey in the north of my constituency or to one as far south as the city of Chester. That is not good educational provision. The amendment would remove the word "area" from clause 8 and substitute the phrase "geographical vicinity". That represents an important change to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as drafted, means that permanently excluded pupils could be rejected by a number of schools. The Minister has spoken about parallel responsibility, which means that the funding agency for schools and the LEAs will divide responsibility for education between their respective sectors. However, if a pupil is permanently excluded from a grant-maintained school, for which the funding agency will have responsibility, will that agency have to try to place the pupil in a school within its own sector? That is a difficult process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one grant-maintained school in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes), and there may soon be other similar schools in Cheshire. Will such schools have to try to place excluded pupils in schools in the same sector? If so, the concept of local education will not be met by the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not clarified the structure that will underpin the funding agency for schools. We have been told that there will be 10 to 15 members of the funding
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
agency for schools, but we have not been told how they will carry out their functions. Without that information, clause 8 will be difficult for the Government to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a pupil who has been permanently excluded from a grant-maintained school and whose application for reinstatement has been rejected by the initial level of administration, passed on to the appeals committee and rejected again. If the school is in an area in which the funding agency for schools has responsibility, who, under clause 8, is responsible for finding a place for that pupil? The answer to that question must help rather than hinder our examination of clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8, as drafted, could mean that a pupil excluded in Warrington might have to go all the way to the Welsh border for a school place. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) will want to know what will happen with the cross-border problems that may arise between the Principality and adjacent LEAs in England. We need to know what the role of the funding agency will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the Minister about the right of appeal and I look forward to his answer. However, I hope that he will agree that pupils will be excluded from schools for a number of reasons. When we debate amendment No. 184, we shall consider in detail what can be done to help those pupils who are permanently excluded. At present, we must accept the principle of the educational needs of those pupils. It would be good educational practice to build into the Bill the provision that those pupils will be entitled to be educated in their locality. If the pupils are educated in the geographical vicinity of the school from which they are excluded or near to their residence, they will retain their connections with the community in which they live. Pupils benefit from going to local schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument relates to convenience. If we accept the amendment and the word "area" is deleted and substituted with "geographical vicinity", we would do something about the travelling that pupils may have to undertake to reach a school outside the community in which they have been brought up. Most pupils are educated in schools in their local community. If they are excluded from those schools, they may have to travel some distance. The amendment would ensure that that distance would be the minimum possible. Every Member of Parliament knows the difficulties of travelling to and from his or her constituency, so if pupils have to travel to school each day we should all empathise with that problem. Journey time is wasted time in the pupils' education. Pupils should have the benefits of being in school, including the extra-curricular activities to which I shall refer soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pupils should also be educated in their own geographical vicinity for safety and security reasons. We have all heard horror stories of pupils travelling long distances to reach home late at night and the problems that arise if they miss the school bus and decide to walk. Those problems are exacerbated if pupils are educated a long way from home. That is another reason to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, if pupils who are permanently excluded from education near their home and community are educated in the geographical vicinity, that would safeguard their community instincts. Local schools have a great contribution to make to the wealth and health of the quality of life in a community. Pupils should be able to enjoy and to join in that. If pupils are permanently excluded and have exhausted all the appeals procedures,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
which are lengthy to say the least—we should try to educate them as close as possible to their own communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy for pupils who are excluded from a school, especially if they have been in the school for some time. They may have been at a secondary school since the age of 11 and reached the end of what was the third year—I do not know what that is called now. [HON. MEMBERS: "Year 9."] If the pupils reach year 9, they will have made many friends in the school. If they have to go to another school, that will be a great wrench in their education and a difficult problem to overcome. The closer the pupils stay to their communities, the less will that problem be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that developments in recent years have strengthened his case? First, from what I hear, some schools within an LEA are greatly reluctant to accept children who have been permanently excluded by others. That is explained by the desire of schools to compete well in league tables. Therefore, they will not accept children who will not help them to do that. It is important that we accept the amendment, because it would ensure that an LEA's failure to place a child would not lead it to place him even further away from where he lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it appears from the statistics that more children from primary schools are being excluded than has ever been the case. Children in that age group show one of the biggest increases in permanent exclusion. That is a tragedy with which we should deal. Does my hon. Friend accept that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief. Let us leave it there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that guidance Sir John. Does my hon. Friend accept that the safety point adds to the strength of his argument about the need to have a school that is close to where the child lives? That is more important for primary than for secondary school children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to that intervention from my hon. Friend because it helps to focus my mind on the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My teaching experience was in the secondary sector. A frequent criticism of my view of education was that I tended to concentrate on the secondary sector. My hon. Friend's points about the safety of and security for primary school pupils are even more essential when applied to my examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exclusions in the primary sector, which the statistics prove are growing, are alarming. I have a particular view about the quality of primary education because my child has gone through the primary sector: I have been impressed by primary education. If we cannot keep pupils in primary schools, we have a real problem when they reach the secondary level. For that reason, I think that the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) was valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made another point about permanent exclusion in local schools and the informal mechanism. Parents make phone calls, saying, "I'd like my child to go to school X because it's the next nearest one to where we live." They make an informal approach to the head teacher, and the head teacher asks why they want their son or daughter to come to his school. They reply, "Well, he's
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
been permanently excluded from the school next door." The head teacher says, "I've already taken three exclusions from that school, and I am having no more." The parents then have to go to the appeals procedure and get embroiled in the argument about the effective use of resources, which is a fail-safe device in the exclusion process, but it takes far too long to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that we allow pupils to develop friendship groups. Education is about not only the academic activities that occur in school, but the social education that pupils receive in secondary schools. We should allow that to happen. Pupils who are divorced from their communities and from the schools that serve their communities find it even more difficult. The amendment addresses that practical problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that could be addressed by the amendment is a financial one. If a pupil is placed in a school that is a considerable distance from his home, there is a cost to the LEA and the funding agency. The municipal bus services have been deregulated and bus services in rural areas are few and far between, and the circuitous routes between a pupil's community and the school may have been permanently excluded. That route could be a long distance, which costs the LEA in travel expenses. The route is often done by taxi—the most expensive form of transport. There is a financial reason for accepting that it would be far better for permanently excluded pupils to be entitled to a school that is in the geographical vicinity of their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is educational reason for pupils attending local schools. If a pupil is permanently excluded from the school that is in walking distance of his home and he has to find a school several miles away, to which he travels by taxi, he is denied an important aspect of school life. If the extra-curricular activities take place during lunchtimes, pupils are not affected, but, they predominantly occur after school. Drama clubs—in which my wife is very much involved—sometimes carry on until 5.30 pm and it is important that the pupils return home safely. If they have to travel some distance, they will be excluded from participating in drama. Yesterday, in questions to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) discussed school music. School music bands generally rehearse after school. If pupils are permanently excluded and have musical talent and find themselves in a school some distance away, they may also be excluded from participating in music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems with music in the national curriculum. One of the ways that music teachers try to get round the problem of the lack of peripatetic music teachers is to teach children after school in their spare time. I would not want to deny anyone that facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sports clubs play a great part in the life of most schools. Pupils who have some distance to travel home are unable to enjoy the benefits of those sporting activities. The amendment would help to solve those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Yesterday, on the Floor of the House he mentioned county and borough youth orchestras, which are important, but access to those youth orchestras is generally through the school music department. Pupils may be unable to perform in their school orchestras because they have to travel some distance to get home. If they are at a school away from their community they may have a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea is interested in music. My local authority, through lottery grants, gives large amounts of money to promote music. Unless we can ensure that pupils are educated locally, they may miss out on that enjoyment. An interest in music may keep pupils in school when the rest of the national curriculum is not meeting their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parental involvement in a child's education is essential. If parents are fortunate enough to have a job, they may find it difficult to travel the distance to their child's school. The school may be in the local authority area or in the less well defined area of a funding agency. If there is direct parental involvement, pupils are often committed to the school. It is vital that the home-school link is fostered, developed and nurtured and that is best done in local community based schools. If pupils are excluded from activities because they have to travel some distance, it is more difficult for parents to be involved in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my son started primary school I was able to take him to school in the morning because of the nature of my job. That contact with the school was superb because I developed an excellent relationship with teachers who taught my son. If pupils have to travel great distances rather than within their geographical vicinity, that help to the educational process may be denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the responsibility of the funding agency for schools or the LEA to provide an alternative place for an excluded child. Does the Bill prevent the LEA from crossing a boundary to provide an educational place for an excluded pupil? The Bill refers to finding a place within the pupil's area. However, the amendment would provide for finding a place within the child's geographical vicinity. That is a major difference. At present, LEAs can cross boundaries if necessary to find educational places for pupils. Parents can apply for the school that they perfer. We do not know what the funding agency for schools will do. We need clarification about whether its powers will be restricted to the area for which it is responsible, and about parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make the needs of the pupil paramount, by substituting "geographical vicinity" for "area". The Government will alleviate our fears if they
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
accept the amendment. They will also show their commitment to some ideals that I try to promote—the benefits of attending local schools. The paramountcy of the child has been enshrined in legislation since 1989. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Warrington, South made some valuable points. I look forward to the Minister's response. Although I support what the hon. Member for Warrington, South said, I shall not repeat all the issues that he raised. He made two crucial points. He emphasised the importance of getting excluded pupils back to school as quickly as possible. I am tempted to reflect on the phrase that was used earlier in Committee: that the Secretary of State likes to think of himself as the nation's headmaster. Perhaps it would give added impetus to getting children back to school if we made them sit in the headmaster's study while we awaited directions about the clause. The hon. Member for Warrington also stressed the importance of educating children as close to home as possible and minimising travelling time and distance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers exclusion. I am sure that we are delighted that the Government recently circulated a consultation document on that issue. Although I disagree with many of its points, that document included the Government's acceptance of the fact that exclusion should be the last resort and should not be undertaken lightly by schools. Therefore, the Government accept the importance of getting excluded children back to school as quickly as possible. The clause covers the orders and directions that will get pupils back to school. The hon. Member for Warrington, South raised several points about definitions in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Reasonable" needs further clarification. Amendment No. 122 would define "reasonable" as used in the phrase "reasonable distance" in subsection (1). The Minister is clearly not averse to the concept of defining words and phrases in the Bill. Subsection (5) provides a definition of "suitable education" while "the appropriate authority" is defined in subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that subsection (6) contains a definition of "the appropriate authority". We are told that until the introduction of the third phase, the appropriate authority in respect of exclusions shall be the local education authority, while in the third phase, following the operation of the 75 per cent. trigger mechanism, it will be the funding authority. The Minister may find it worth while to reflect on his own consultation document on exclusions, which makes no reference to the funding authority and the role that it might play in the third phase if the 75 per cent. mechanism is ever triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Definitions in the Bill are clearly accepted: clauses 251, 252 and 253 do nothing but define phrases. I believe that a clearer definition of "reasonable distance" is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, a school may be directed to admit a pupil who would otherwise be without a place. The directed place should be in a school which is a "reasonable distance" from the child's home. Unfortunately, that protection is greatly reduced by the lack of definition of a "reasonable" distance. Without a clear definition, responsibility for defining what is a reasonable distance will lie with the appropriate authority, whether it be the funding authority or the LEA. Without a clear definition, parents will be in considerable difficulty if they object to, or wish to challenge, the choice of school in the direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
It would be harder and take longer to object on the basis of the words "reasonable" or "reasonableness" than on the basis of a clearly specified distance or time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If something is stated in the Bill, it should be clear. I propose a form of words which estabishes a limit to the distance that should be travelled. I would be quite happy if the Minister suggested an alternative choice of words. But it is important to have clarification of "reasonable distance". I look forward to the Minister's response, and possibly to his acceptance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warrington, South listed the reasons that the Minister might give for not accepting the amendment. I was somewhat surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not invoke the traditional concept of the Christmas spirit as a reason for the Minister to accept it. One is reminded of the Minister's "joke" in a previous sitting, in which the hon. Gentleman claimed that the Bill was a landmark cake. No doubt we shall soon have to refer to a landmark Christmas cake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me first respond to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). I do not accept his suggestion, because someone living near King's Cross could be in Peterborough within the hour. Similarly someone living near Dover could be across the channel in an hour, whereas it takes more than an hour to travel from the furthest part of my constituency to Westminster. As the hon. Gentleman has not specified the form of travel, I am sure that he would agree that the amendment is too vague. I accept his point as it relates to that of the hon. Member for Warrington, South about the distance that an excluded pupil should be expected to travel. The hon. Gentleman raised that in the context of a local authority area and gave examples in which the distance could be so great as to require that a child be removed from the locality to which he had become accustomed, prevent parental involvement in the school and have implications for music and other matters to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry about the clause, as outlined partly by the hon. Member for Warrington, South, is that I am extremely nervous about a local education authority having the power to export its problems to another local education authority area. That could happen if the clause gave the LEA the power to direct a school in an area beyond its LEA boundary to accept a pupil who had been expelled or suspended. We must ensure that every child is placed, and if that means squeezing a child into a school, that is better than squeezing a child out of a school. The LEA must be responsible for placing a pupil who has been excluded from one of its schools in another school in its area. Otherwise, many problems could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases the parental choice will be to cross an LEA boundary. Clearly, that is acceptable. It would be fine if a school across an LEA boundary chose to accept a parent's application that had been made voluntarily. However, a school across a borough or LEA boundary might be full, and, in the interests of the education of the other children in the school, could refuse a parent's voluntary application. Under the clause, schools would not be able to make such a refusal. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider whether my worry is well founded. I understand what the hon. Member for Warrington, South says about distances within LEA areas, but we must
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
be careful that whatever is decided should not permit the crossing of boundaries to the detriment of pupils and schools in neighbouring areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South. The direction and tenor of his argument were exactly to the point and effective. I recall the days when pupils were suspended and other local secondary schools would seize them rapidly because that meant extra points and extra cash. Schools felt that they were losing capitation through suspension during that period. Such problems were overcome through voluntary, not directed, co-operation. I must say to the hon. Member for Battersea that neighbouring education authorities usually have good relationships, and it is important that they openly discuss problems relating to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South said about music, sport and drama. Disruptive pupils are often brought into the corpus by means of sport, drama and music. It is important to recognise, for example, that children in my area who shine in rugby league notice an improvement in the rest of their work and become far less disruptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point for the Minister is technical. It cannot take the form of an amendment, but I would be grateful if he would consider it. Under section 6(6) of the Education Act 1980, there was an agreement with voluntary aided schools allowing a limit on the number of non-adherent pupils who could go to specific schools. Will clauses 8 and 9 change that agreement or will it remain in place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish that, even if voluntary aided schools have spare places, they will be able to maintain a balance. That is not to say that they should not accept disruptive pupils. There is often a good case for voluntary aided schools to accept such pupils. They can often deal with them better than other schools, but the balance must not be upset, as was agreed under the 1980 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 8 and 9 are about the power and procedure to direct admission of a child to a school and the refusal to admit or the decision to exclude a child from a school or schools. The Bill will give the power to direct a school to accept a child after consultation with parents, the governing body of the school proposed and the local education authority, should it be a neighbouring authority. The power of direction remains with the LEA until phase 3—until the 75 per cent. trigger is reached. I am pleased that the Minister is nodding in agreement. This is a delicate matter. It is not thought suitable to have parallel or shared responsibility, or even parallel but shared responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour members of the Committee are worried about whether the word "area" is intended to signify an LEA area. It should not. The nearest suitable school may be in another LEA area. It is not clear whether the funding authority, as the appropriate authority, will be restricted to specifying a school in the LEA area when the 75 per cent. trigger is reached, as the LEA could be. I think that the Minister has cleared up the latter point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school or neighbouring local education authority can refer to the Secretary of State who will then decide which school and neighbouring LEA will be directed to take a child. Again, the Secretary of State is taking absolute power upon himself. The power covers LEA-maintained and grant-maintained schools. It does not cover maintained special schools. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that when he responds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
We are discussing suitable education, which is denned as
	<br><blockquote><p>"efficient full-time education suitable to … age, ability, and aptitude and to any special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
There is a fear that some LEA schools will become dumping grounds for disruptive children who would reduce the scores in examination league tables in the more desirable schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister probably has a great deal to say on that subject as the Department for Education has just published proposals for handling exclusions. 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> reported that he is considering fines for schools that exclude children and financial incentives for those that take disruptive, problem children. The Minister argued that exclusion was a last resort, but we are worried that the pressure of league tables will lead to schools getting rid of disruptive children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in 	<i>The Independent on Sunday</i> last weekend mentioned the difficulties anticipated by the National Association of Head Teachers at their conference in Preston. I do not necessarily associate myself with the views expressed, but I thought that the Committee might be interested in them. The article reported that rage against the Minister expressed by members of the NAHT was volcanic:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Forth is a raving lunatic,' said one. He has absolutely no idea how schools are run. I just wish he would visit Planet Earth occasionally.'"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We realise that the Minister has difficulty coming down to planet earth from his lofty position, but many head teachers think it appropriate that he should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to direct the admission of children to a school should be enshrined in law; it should not require financial bribes to encourage schools to do their duty. A deregulated market will not operate fairly. Some schools will be happy to pay to get rid of some little monsters. The question is whether public money should be used for that purpose. The point is underlined by a further comment in the same article in 	<i>The Independent on Sunday.</i> A head teacher described the difficulty that he had in expelling or excluding a pupil from school:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was a break-in at the school on a Sunday. A fire was started which wrecked the gym. All the pupils were horrified and the grapevine quickly told me that the culprit was a middle-class pupil of mine. The police took him in but, because he claimed that he dropped a cigarette accidentally, they let him off with a caution.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The governing body would not accept my decision to expel him and sent him back. It said he came from a good family and should be given a second chance. I still feel terrible. How can I maintain good order and discipline when the pupils know that the only punishment for causing £20,000-worth of damage is a caution."</p></blockquote>
That story emphasises the difficulties involved. It is important to distinguish between the free market philosophy, which would be imposed by a fines system, and the proposal in the amendment, which would enshrine in law the duty to admit disruptive pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities have responded to the White Paper. The Association of County Councils want the new power to be extended so that a grant-maintained school must reconsider a decision to exclude a pupil, if only because an increasing incidence of exclusion of obstructive
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
or idle pupils would increse costs substantially. The association also expressed concern about the LEA's ability to ensure suitable education without having overall responsibility for planning places. That problem could arise especially in phase 2, the so-called transitional phase, in which LEAs do not have the sole power to provide places but may be directed to try to find places for disruptive pupils. That could cause difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The amendment is intended to ensure that a child is not sent to a school that is a long and exhausting journey away at the other end of the county. The reasons are obvious, but there is a little ambiguity in amendment No. 122, tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, in which one hour's travel time presumably means a journey that lasts an hour by whatever means of school transport is provided. Parental anxiety about long journeys, especially for youngsters with physical handicaps, is very real. Many youngsters would find a long journey extremely tiring, especially if there is no help on the school bus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to parents in Cambridgeshire—not in my constituency—who are worried about the supervision undertaken by transport staff on long journeys to school. Hon. Members may not be aware of the system that is commonly in operation at the moment, but the difficulties are immense. Many children travel to school on double-decker buses. There is no supervision inside the bus. Usually, the only adult presence is the bus driver, who has the appalling task of driving a school bus while supervising 80 children, many of whom are sufficiently grown up and boisterous to be fairly disruptive. In Cambridgeshire at least, children are forced to sit three to a seat, which makes the job even more difficult. A group of parents in Cambridge are so worried about the problem that they are conducting an active campaign to make seatbelts in buses compulsory. That would make it impossible to have three children to a seat and it is hoped that strapping the children down would reduce the incidence of disruptive behaviour. Those are real difficulties and we must try to reduce the journey times to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that has caused parents to worry about the standard of accommodation and safety in school transport stems from compulsory competitive tendering for transport services and uncertainty about the ability of transport staff—many of whom are well past retirement age—to cope with difficulties. For educational and social reasons, the children covered by clause 8 should go to school as near as possible to their local Committees. They should not be transported at high cost and risk to themselves, and others, to dump schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment seriously. It applies only to the small number of pupils—about 3,000 a year—who are permanently excluded from schools. Even so, it is an important amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have to say that his knowledge of Welsh geography is limited, as we discovered on Second Reading. However, I know that the Minister of State, Welsh Office knows Wales from one

	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
end to the other. He might even be able to persuade the Under-Secretary of State for Schools to change some of the definitions in clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Minister for Warrington, South, who spoke about the definition of the word "area". I want to bring to the Committee's attention the fact that that is especially important in Wales—not so much now, but in the event of a reorganisation of local government. There are only eight LEAs in Wales and some of them are geographically very large. Powys is probably one of the largest LEAs, geographically, in Great Britain. There has been a good record of co-operation between LEAs with regard to border areas and borderline cases. My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South referred to the co-operation in the border areas of England and Wales. For example, English students from the forest of Dean travel to the Welsh LEA school in Monmouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that if 24 or 25 new LEAs are set up, many of them will cater for a population of no more than 60,000 to 70,000 people. By definition, those LEAs will be very small. If the word "area" is not defined more precisely or we do not receive an adequate reply from the Minister, considerable difficulties may arise when those LEAs attempt to deal with the exclusion of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the case of a Welsh valley that is a dozen miles long and a couple of miles wide. It is small geographically and may have only a handful of schools, some of which may be grant-maintained, others run by the LEA and others voluntary aided. There could be great practical difficulties unless schools in adjoining LEAs, which could also be small authorities, co-operate realistically. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath raised an important point about the definition of "reasonableness". That word is always difficult to define in legislation. We debated the word "reasonable" on the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill, the latest Welsh Bill to pass through the House. There was great kerfuffle in that Committee because of our attempts to define the word. In the Welsh context, in which the geography of a small area may be so varied, unless a specific time is stipulated, the clause will be meaningless. In Wales, distances can mean nothing. A mile or two could mean a great mountain range between two valleys that are served by separate LEAs. The question of timing is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) referred to voluntary aided schools and his point needs to be considered in an English and a Welsh context. If pupils are excluded, a small LEA or grant-maintained schools may be tempted to place such pupils in voluntary aided schools—if they have surplus places. That would contravene and break agreements that were signed, sealed and delivered between the LEAs and the Churches. The Minister must provide a firm answer to the fears that the Churches have expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Churches also have fears about travel. On the question of home to school travel for voluntary aided schools, the Bill is silent. I hope that this is not the first of a number of occasions when we shall ask the Government what they intend to do about travel costs if voluntary aided schools opt out. Some LEAs cover sparsely populated areas, such as Wales. There are few voluntary aided schools in the Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Christmas is probably getting at me or perhaps the hon. Member for Warrington, South has not witnessed me accept an amendment, because I shall now allow him that pleasure. I have listened to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends and I have been persuaded that the spirit of amendment No. 94 is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is traditional, I shall not ask the Committee to vote for it now but will ask the hon. Member for Warrington, South to consider seeking leave to withdraw the amendment on my firm undertaking to return subsequently with another that will put into effect the spirit of what he seeks. All of the arguments adduced by Opposition Members about the importance of geographical vicinity and so on have validity. I am persuaded by them and I should like to return with an amendment to give effect to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members asked important questions and the first that I shall deal with was asked by the hon. Member for Cambridge. The hon. Lady wanted to know whether special schools, either maintained or non-maintained, could be directed to admit a child under the provisions of clause 8. The answer is no, because clause 8(6)(a) does not refer to such schools, so they would not be encompassed by the powers within the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to burst in on the Minister but in giving that assurance to my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge he raises another point. It may be dealt with elsewhere in the Bill and, if so, he can direct me to the right clause. What if the pupil being excluded has severe emotional and behavioural problems which require a statement? Would not that child end in a special school because of that process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to obtain advice on that important question because I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman an off-the-cuff answer. If advice does not arrive while I am on my feet, I undertake to provide him with an answer subsequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point raised by the hon. Members for Hemsworth and for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) about the voluntary aided schools. Clause 8 is not intended to override in any way the agreements for preserving the religious character of VA schools. Our view is that clause 9 offers sufficient protection in that regard, so I think that I can give both hon. Gentlemen the assurances that they sought on behalf of that very important section of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question asked by the hon. Member for Warrington, South was subsequently reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. It was whether LEAs could, as my hon. Friend put it, "export a problem" to another education authority. Both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend have a point. Certainly, it was not our intention in drafting the Bill to allow an LEA to either export its problem or dump its children, whichever phrase one wants to use. The home LEA owes a duty to the child to ensure that a place is provided and that matter runs throughout all past legislation and the Bill. I should like to think about the matter and return to the Committee with a solution to the problem if I may because I am convinced that this represents an inherent difficulty which should be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point, my goodwill runs out. It is always in limited supply and I have just exhausted it because I cannot agree with amendment No. 122 for an important reason. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea illustrated the point much better than I could when he said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
that one hour's travel varies so enormously in its implications and context, depending on the nature or geography of the area that is under discussion, that it becomes a meaningless concept. I am slightly surprised that some Opposition Members wish to subscribe to the idea underlying the amendment that it would undercut the facility for local decision making. Transport is so important that it is right that local education authorities should be able to exercise their judgment on what is reasonable and correct in that context. To put into the Bill what is in the amendment or any other formulation—one could vary it almost to choice—would not be the right way to approach the subject. It would be better to leave that matter as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point made by the hon. Member for Torfaen, I do not intend to bring to the Committee at any stage in its deliberations on the Bill suggestions for changing the arrangements for transport. It is a difficult subject, on which there are many different views. As the hon. Gentleman may recall, an effort that was made some years ago to alter the arrangements got into dreadful difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time I have discussions on the matter with LEAs and other interested bodies, but I remain to be convinced that there is a demonstrably better way of dealing with the entire subject of transport in education than we have at present. I do not say that it is flawless or that it could not be improved, but nobody has yet presented to me a suggestion that is workable, clearly an improvement and containable within any reasonable resource provision. That is my reply to the hon. Gentleman in terms of the overall transport position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with the amendment, for the reasons that I have given. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Warrington, South if he will withdraw amendment No. 94, on my firm undertaking that I shall return with a wording that will give effect to his clearly expressed intentions, with which I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Bath were to press his amendment, I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need your guidance, Sir John. This is new territory for me. I have never been present when the Minister has made such a concession, so I do not know whether I should spend 10 or 15 minutes summing up the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Minister for accepting our argument about the need for greater clarity in the Bill with regard to the terms "area" or "geographical vicinity". Will the Minister make a similar concession in respect of amendment No. 124, which deals in detail with a similar matter? If he did that, it would save the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take into consideration the fact that although the Education Act 1944 gives the LEA the power to direct a pupil to a particular school, that direction, about which the hon. Member for Battersea is concerned because of the cross-LEA boundary issue that we raised, is predicated on parental choice. When the Minister formulates an amendment to the Bill, I hope that parental choice will be an element in the directions that the LEA may issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's generous offer and mark it down as a first, although I am not sure what it will do for my street credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make through my amendment 2 was the important need for a clear definition of the phrase "reasonable distance". I still believe that there will be a problem such as I described. The hon. Member for Warrington, South referred to my amendment No. 122, which deals with a similar and related issue. Perhaps, the Minister will intervene and say that he also accepts the spirit behind it. However, I shall not press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 184, in page 4, line 22, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>', the appropriate authority having first satisfied itself that no pupil has been permanently excluded unless
	<ol>
	<li>all reasonable steps have been taken by the school to avoid excluding the pupil, and</li>
	<li>allowing the pupil to continue to attend the school would be seriously detrimental to the education or welfare of the pupil, other pupils, teaching staff or non-teaching staff at the school.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister might extend to this amendment the Christmas spirit that has overcome him, and that the Government will accept that the amendment is reasonable and in line with current Government thinking, as set out in the DFE discussion paper on exclusions which was published recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be clear about our intention, which is to limit the power of schools to exclude pupils by establishing a framework of grounds and criteria for permanent exclusion. We should be under no illusion whatever about the scale of the problem. The Government have monitored permanent exclusions through the national exclusion reporting system—the NERS. That has highlighted only the tip of the iceberg, for it deals only with permanent exclusions and takes no account of fixed-period exclusions or indefinite exclusions. Even so, the results from the first year of that monitoring show that about 3,000 pupils have been permanently excluded from schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Union of Teachers has also carried out a survey. It covered only 26 local education authorities, but it showed more pupils being excluded than the NERS returns. That is because the NUT included other forms of exclusion. The NUT estimates that if the figures are extrapolated and calculated across the whole of the country, about 25,000 pupils have been excluded over the past year. Many of those children are left in an education no man's land of temporary or informal exclusions. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I accept that those exclusions are legal under the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, but they occur regularly. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Rather a lot of conversation is going on, which makes it difficult for the Chair and for the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters to hear what is being said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir John. Many of the informal exclusions are probably illegal under the 1986 Act. In my experience of working for a local education authority, I have lost count of the times when children have been told by staff, and not always by the head teacher, not to come back to school until they could return with their parents, or until an appointment had been made with an educational psychologist. Some such children could be away from school for weeks or even months—in a sort of limbo. Often they are children whose school attendance was a worry to the school and the education authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
before the exclusion. Attempting to integrate them back into regular school attendance is often a nightmare for both teachers and support staff, particularly education welfare officers and social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NERS returns for the first year show that of the 3,000 pupils who were permanently excluded, about one in eight already possessed statements of special educational need. That is incredible when we consider that the Government's estimate for the number of pupils who have a statement is 2 per cent. of the total. That means that 12·5 per cent. or 13 per cent. of permanently excluded children have a statement of special educational need. We can safely assume that there must also be a sizeable proportion of permanently excluded children in the process of being formally assessed under section 5 of the Education Act 1985, who have yet to receive their statement of special needs, or for whom no determination of a statement has been made. We can also assume that, if that is so, and if the Government's estimate is correct that 2 per cent. of pupils need a statement, a further 18 per cent. will have special educational needs at some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider that 12·5 per cent. of pupils who are permanently excluded have a statement, the Government's logic dictates that there must be a much larger group of children who are permanently excluded who have special needs, but for whom it is not thought appropriate to make a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are worried about the length of time that it takes some local education authorities to conclude formal assessment and the statementing process. In my constituency, appointments have been made by educational psychologists to see children in school who have emotional and behavioural problems and to assess them within a classroom setting. In addition, they advise teaching staff on the appropriate approaches to deal with disruptive behaviour. When those psychologists attend schools to assess the children, often the children have already been excluded. That is an outrageous waste of professional time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such exclusions cause an outrageous delay in the statementing process, too. I refer again to the NERS information that the Government have made available, from which I discovered that, in the main, the children were not excluded for physical aggression against teaching staff. According to the Government's figures, only 7 per cent. of permanent exclusions were for such behaviour, and only 14 per cent. of exclusions were the result of physical aggression against other pupils. The overwhelming majority of permanent exclusions were for disobedience, flouting school rules and for being insolent to teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the NUT survey, one category in the top five reasons given by schools for excluding children was because they were either poor school attenders or had absconded regularly from school. It is bizarre to say that
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
children who do not wish to attend school will, in a sense, be rewarded by the school by being excluded from it. What nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, if schools are using non-attendance as an excuse for exclusion, we could conclude that, once information is published about schools, that would become a greater feature in educational circles and one that should be condemned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South; he makes an excellent point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would wish to play down the importance of flouting school rules, being disobedient to teachers and so on. I do not condone it, but they are flimsy reasons for wrecking a child's education and probably a child's career prospects, especially given the provision that is available to children who have been excluded permanently. Many such children end up with home tuition which can often be for only one-and-a-half hours or two hours a day. That is completely inadequate for children who might be in their GCSE year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in substantial agreement with the hon. Gentleman, but the difficulty facing schools is that the punishments available to them are not as extensive at present as they once were. The hon. Gentleman might agree that the old idea of having a cane in the corner of the head's study was an invaluable deterrent. It was not often used, but the fact that it was there was enough. I hope that he can support me in my efforts to bring back corporal punishment to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it illuminates Tory thinking. I have often heard people say that they were flogged at school and that it did them no harm. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is a clear example of such treatment doing considerable damage. We are talking about children with special educational needs, and the hon. Gentleman suggests that the way to deal with such children is for them to be assaulted by teachers. That is appalling. What should be available in a wider context is more in-service training, more educational psychologists and more help given to teachers to prevent disruption from happening within the classroom and for them not to resort to assaulting pupils who have special needs.
