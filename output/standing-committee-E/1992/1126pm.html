PROVISION OF INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 112, in page 2, line 32, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() shall make an annual report to the Secretary of State, who shall lay a copy of it before each House of Parliament;'.—[<i>Mrs. Anne Campbell.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 69, in page 2, line 39, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The funding authority shall publish annual reports that shall be made publicly available.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Up to now, in my reply I had referred entirely to the funding agency for schools. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Welsh Office has asked me to make it clear to the Committee that the arrangements that I described this morning will apply to the schools funding council for Wales when it is established. I hope that that will help hon. Members to understand fully the mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurances.<br><br>
A number of points were raised and, in the hope that when annual reports are published—the Minister assures us that that will happen—I will comment on three useful ones.<br><br>
The first, about clarity, was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright). The second, relating to the use of clear English in the reports, which is important to parents; not to mention politicians; understanding of them, was made by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson). The third, accountability, was raised by several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris). The recent difficulties that have arisen following the publication of examination results show that there is a lack of understanding of where responsibility for concise and accurate information lies. The Department for Education blamed the press and LEAs for the mistakes, and the LEAs blamed the Department for Education. It is important to show, precisely, where that responsibility lies.<br><br>
On accountability, my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) said that other performance indicators apart from financial ones should be reported on. I hope that the Minister will take my comments on board. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 2, line 36, at end insert
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
<br><blockquote><p>'; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) shall provide the Secretary of State with information each year to show that each school funded by a funding authority is fulfilling the requirements of any statutory instrument relating to the National Curriculum, and undertaking Standard Assessment Tests under the Education Reform Act 1988.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would improve the Bill because it would ensure that all schools covered by the funding agency, and the funding council in Wales, undertake the requirements of the national curriculum and the standard assessment tasks, as required in the Education Reform Act 1988.<br><br>
The Bill contains an anomaly in that that requirement was omitted. No doubt that was but an aberration on the Minister's part. When he winds up, no doubt he will accept the amendment and the Committee will go forward without further debate on the matter.<br><br>
The Education Reform Act 1988 placed a requirement upon the Secretary of State, LEAs, governors and head teachers to ensure that the national curriculum was followed in maintained schools. We wish, as, no doubt, does the Minister, to ensure that that will obtain if the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
Section 2(1) of the 1988 Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The curriculum for every maintained school shall comprise a basic curriculum which includes … a curriculum for all registered pupils at the school of compulsory school age (to be known as 'the National Curriculum.')"</p></blockquote>
The amendment would update the provisions of that Act to take into account the considerable change in circumstances that have taken place since it was passed. We are helping the Government in anticipating that there may be more grant-maintained schools in future, as the Minister said earlier. The amendment would tackle the problems that may arise if "promoters" set up completely new schools or took over those that were not previously in the maintained sector.<br><br>
Speaking about the efficacy of the national curriculum in 1989, the Prime Minister, now Baroness Thatcher, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We must make every effort to see that every child has a good education, whatever their background. That is why we are introducing the national curriculum."—[<i>Official Report, 2</i> May 1989; Vol. 152, c. 17.]</p></blockquote>
In a written answer in April 1990, the Prime Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We need the national curriculum to raise standards in schools."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 April 1990; Vol. 171, c. <i>357.</i>]</p></blockquote>
I shall not argue that case now, because Conservative Members will argue the case for the national curriculum far more energetically and forcefully than me. I shall leave it to the many Conservative Members who have expressed their interest in education: the hon. Members for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon), for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), for Waveney (Mr. Porter) and for Erewash (Mrs. Knight), who, I am sure will jump in on the debate. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey)—is not present, but I am sure that he will be anxious to tell the Committee the wonders of the national curriculum and the SATs. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) is not here either, but, as a former schoolmaster, he will give us the benefit of his knowledge and experience. I am confident that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth will do likewise.<br><br>
The introduction of the national curriculum caused chaos in schools and is continuing to do so. It was ill-thought out and hurried and it has been subject to constant revisions. The hand of Whitehall has been on it, and it has been shown to be inadequate. Despite those revisions, which were due to the haste with which the 1988
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
Act was enacted, we believe that all schools should go ahead in the same way, and be subject to the same rules and laws.<br><br>
We need to accommodate the novel means by which new grant-maintained schools may be set up as stated in clause 41. Part II of the Bill refers to persons described as "promoters" who may be able to set up their own grant-maintained schools. The Bill should contain provisions to ensure that those schools follow the national curriculum and SATs, so that they suffer in the same way as grant-maintained and LEA schools. A promoter who sets up a school may be a religious body, an independent school or a private individual, even an entrepreneur. Perhaps the Minister will give us some guidance on that matter. Whatever the case, new schools and independent schools would not have been subject to the national curriculum before they became maintained schools.<br><br>
May I digress for a moment, Sir John? I am sure, however, that you will come down heavily on me if I stray too far from the amendment. It has been a constant source of wonderment to me that if the national curriculum and SATS were so efficacious, such a good idea, so beneficial to the education of children, and so needed, as the former Prime Minister told us in 1989, why were they never imposed on independent and private schools? I never understood that. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why. It may have something to do with the fact that a preponderance of Conservative Members attended such schools and now send their children to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. Friend because I had the undoubted pleasure of serving on the committee that considered the Education Reform Act 1988—GERBIL. Ministers gave the impression that there was no need to impose the national curriculum and SATs on the independent sector because parents were paying and if they chose the wrong type of education, they had that freedom of choice and it did not matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the benefit of his historical knowledge of these matters. I am sure that some parents in Buckinghamshire will look closely into private schools, but I shall come back to that.<br><br>
Independent schools may look to the state for finance. A number of private independent schools are flagging because the recession is biting deep and many people who could afford private education are now unable to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the amendment relates to the provision of information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. I am grateful to you for pulling me back into line. I was merely pointing out that if the schools that are flagging want to be part of the maintained sector they will have to be subject to the conditions of the national curriculum. I am sure, Sir John, that you understand my line of argument, but with your guidance I shall now impeccably stick to the amendment.<br><br>
Many of those schools are now receiving a reduced income and may look towards the maintained sector. They would then be within the remit of the national curriculum, which would have to be in place in their schools otherwise they would contravene the Education Reform Act 1988 and the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
It may be a good idea for fee-paying schools to consider the national curriculum. In Buckinghamshire, the chairman of the governors at the Sir Henry Floyd grammar school referred to the GCSE results tables and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It cannot be fair for Buckinghamshire to have been pulled down in the rankings by the inclusion of locally sited private schools in our total. These schools pulled our averages down and there is nothing anyone working in education in Buckinghamshire can do about it."</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if those schools were to operate the national curriculum so that they could bring their standards into line with the excellent comprehensives in many LEAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I usually manage to follow the hon. Gentleman, but now he has lost me. The amendment says nothing about providing information about independent schools, so I do not understand his point. The amendment specifies
<br><blockquote><p>"each school funded by a funding authority".</p></blockquote>
Patently, that does not include the independent sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister does not understand my logic, but he was deep in conversation when I dealt with that point. To help him, I shall repeat it. When independent schools flag and look to the state as a promoter of a new school, perhaps in the maintained sector, many will need to begin to implement the national curriculum. I hope that that helps the Minister.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will help the Committee by defining his terms. He has referred to private schools, which I am sure that he knows are run for profit. Public schools are educational trusts. Most of such schools implement the national curriculum and, as far as I am aware, all operate standard testing throughout their pupils' school careers. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is referring to those schools, because I see no prospect of any private school being admitted to the state system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly capable of giving the hon. Member for Hammersmith an answer—[HON. MEMBERS: "Battersea".] I apologise, I meant to say the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Evennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erith and Crayford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs new glasses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that may be true, although the differences are not very great.<br><br>
I was making the point that a private school or an independent school might be the promoter of a new school, which could enter the maintained sector. I dodged from one definition to the other to help the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to ask my hon. Friend what the difference is between my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Soley) and the hon. Member for Battersea. They are a world apart in lots of ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is only a river between us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be more if they stood face to face.<br><br>
If an independent school were to become grant-maintained, it would have to adopt the national curriculum. Such schools are not obliged to do so at the moment. It would also have to implement the standard assessment tasks.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
As I said earlier, the previous Prime Minister had claimed that the national curriculum was needed to raise standards. However, since neither private nor independent schools are under central control, they do not need the national curriculum for that purpose. For example, a school that is now grant-maintained may advertise itself as an independent school
<br><blockquote><p>"where the Government pay the fees".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make it clear that schools in the maintained sector would be subject to the national curriculum and to SATs testing. It would reinforce previous legislation and what the previous Prime Minister said. It would also ensure that schools entering the maintained sector would have to operate in the same way that schools maintained in the LEA sector have had to operate—under close public scrutiny. That would push them to achieve the high standards and proper accountability which parents want. The amendment is needed in the Bill to ensure that promoters of new schools do not think that they are onto an easy touch. Standards that they may have had in the past cannot prevail in the future; they must follow the national curriculum and operate the SATs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is important for two reasons. First, it ensures that everybody is on the so-called level playing field. By level playing field I mean that it keeps the teaching profession together because they have the same interests. For example, the standard assessment tasks are generally thought, throughout the profession, to be not helpful, but harmful. They are harmful not for the reasons that the Government might think; as I understand it, the Government put SATs in place to ensure some sort of quality control. That is entirely right: any decent teacher uses quality control throughout his or her teaching not just once a year, but once a week, or even once a day, particularly in languages.<br><br>
SATs are worrying because there is a devotion to pen and paper. Everything is tested and must be tested every time by some visible formula. Any decent teacher knows—this is especially true in mathematics and languages—that one can more effectively test, control and teach if one does not use mainly pen and ink to test. Many things can be done verbally and it is important to have a conscious plan.<br><br>
My remarks may seem to you, Sir John, or even to the Clerk, to be straying from the amendment: I assure you that they are not. If I accept the Minister's assurances from this morning, the reports on the SATs should show the reactions of the teachers, the pupils and the parents. Parents find SATs worrying. In the first of one of the little schools of which I was a governor before I came here, one of the principal reactions of the parents was to say, "Jane spent all morning doing nothing." Jane spent all morning doing nothing and not being taught because the requirement of the centrally dictated testing meant that the teacher had to be looking at other pupils. That is a shameful waste of time—we need to know if that is happening in every form of report that is being returned.<br><br>
The second reason is the national curriculum. If we are sensibly to assess the way in which the national curriculum is working, we need evidence. It would be unreasonable to withhold such evidence. The Minister may tell us—I am sure that he will because he is very reasonable in such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
matters—that the Government does not wish to be prescriptive, but those tasks will be part of the reports coming through. If that is so, that is fine.<br><br>
There are worrying aspects, which may be covered up if the testimony does not go through, particularly in reference to the national curriculum: in curricula matters there have been swift changes and interference from the top. It is normal to say, "You will learn English" because English can be defined more closely. It is intrusive and insensitive to say, "You will read this, that and the other", instead of providing a range of options in the necessary subject. The reports will reveal the worthlessness of that approach.<br><br>
We regularly discuss sins of commission, but we never refer to sins of omission, which are often more harmful in education. I hope that funding authorities' reports will be able to provide a comprehensive overall picture. The reports will cover a wide sweep of schools—if the Minister has his way—in different parts of the country and in different backgrounds. The overall picture that picks out sins of omission will be very useful. That was a feature of the best reports of Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools. The reports should provide a ready beacon to light the way ahead. We should hone and refine our provisions for the educational system. Yet we do not reflect. As the Minister admitted, we do not meditate. We are simply putting functionaries in place. Functionaries should be put in place for the good of education. To extract the maximum good from the reports, the Government should make a firm commitment to examine the two aspects that I have outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should try to reassure the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) about the independent sector. I refer him to the admirable White Paper, "Choice and Diversity", which has not received much of an airing in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I deplore the content of the White Paper, it is well written. I congratulate the Minister on its presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that generous remark, which I shall pass on to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who is author of the document, as he has often said proudly.<br><br>
Paragraph 1.60 of the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Good independent schools will always flourish in a free society; others will not and may close. Indeed, some of those at the margins may well face severe pressure in their catchment areas as parents recognise the high quality of state education."</p></blockquote>
Nothing suggests that the Government wish to encourage failing independent schools to seek refuge in the maintained sector. Any independent school's application to become grant maintained under the aegis of clause 41 would be subject to approval by the Secretary of State. The curriculum of that school would be taken into account as well as the basic needs case: the provision of places and the number of pupils in the area. The Bill provides no easy option for an independent school that is unable to satisfy parents who pay fees to it. It cannot slide easily into the maintained sector and continue at the taxpayers' expense. I want to make it clear that that should not been seen as an option. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. No doubt the governors of the Sir Henry Floyd school in Buckinghamshire also will be grateful to hear that news.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0263">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of aspects of the amendment still puzzle me, despite Opposition Members' comments. Its effect would be to oblige the funding authority, somehow, to collect evidence that could be given to the Secretary of State. Providing evidence to show that each school funded by a funding authority was fulfilling the necessary requirements implies positive action by the funding agency for schools that, in a sense, goes beyond anything that the Government envisaged for it.<br><br>
The amendment is an interesting example of Opposition Members wanting to give the funding agency additional powers and responsibilities to do more than we had envisaged. It is a development that we may have to watch carefully. I want to ensure that we know what is expected of the agency, and, indeed, circumscribe it carefully.<br><br>
Opposition Members seem to be going in a different direction, which is even more puzzling because LEAs are not required to provide such information about their schools. It is puzzling that the Opposition think that the agency should be required to do so, especially in the light of the fact—I am addressing points raised by the hon. Member for Hemsworth—that we now have Ofsted, a new independent body that will report regularly on schools.<br><br>
In addition the published information which we launched recently with such great fanfares was welcomed widely by parents. We shall have comprehensive, regular publication of the type of information that will tell us about the performance of all schools. This will be added to incrementally in coming years, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said recently.<br><br>
Given those facts, it is surprising, to say the least, that hon. Members would want to give the funding agency for schools additional responsibility—and additional power, which, presumably, would require extra resources which I should be reluctant to give in this context—when that appears unnecessary. The Secretary of State will have detailed data from Ofsted, and from the information that has been produced on SATS and other things—information that will be added to in future—which will go even further that that requested in the Opposition amendment. The amendment is unnecessary. It would add further responsibility and burden on the funding agency, which would be unwarranted, especially in the light of the comprehensive and all-embracing information that will be available. If that is not enough for Opposition Members, I shall be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that one of our problems is that we are having difficulty defining funding agencies, because—perhaps deliberately—they closely defined in the Bill. The Minister is apparently saying that funding agencies will merely, according to the Secretary of State's pre-determined plan, give money to grant-maintained schools and check up on whether it has been properly spent. If that is to be their sole role, would that not be better undertaken by accountants than by all the part-time members of those agencies and a string of civil servants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not their sole role. The funding activity, within the prescribed formulae that will be in place subsequently, is their major role, but as time goes on the planning of place role will be also be vital.<br><br>
That leads me to a further thought. I wonder whether Opposition Members are implying in their amendment that if, via this rather bureaucratic procedure that they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
suggest, a school is found not to be doing as they suggest, funds would be peremptorily cut off. Later in the Bill, there are mechanisms for following up reports by Ofsted, charging the governors of grant-maintained schools, or the LEA, as appropriate, with making improvements to it, whether in the context of an education association or in the usual course of events. Those mechanisms should cover the point that is worrying hon. Members, unless they are suggesting that when the bureaucratic procedure throws up additional information that the curriculum requirements are not being fulfilled the funding would be cut off. If not, I am not sure of the point of the amendment. It goes beyond the normal mechanisms that are available through Ofsted reporting, normal performance reporting, the role of parents and governors of the school, the annual reports and so on that would have to be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That important point should be clarified. The 1988 Act places a legal responsibility on LEAs to ensure that the schools that they control satisfy the requirements of the national curriculum. My anxiety is what will happen after a school has left LEA control. Will the law require the funding agency to ensure that all grant-maintained schools operate the national curriculum and SA7s? If that is not the case, that legal responsibility has been removed from those schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point and Opposition Members seem—deliberately or not—to have missed the thrust of my argument. That legal responsibility will be on the governors of the grant-maintained schools. They will have a legal obligation to implement the national curriculum arrangements. As is the case with much of the new regime, the emphasis is increasingly on the schools—with the governors. That harks back to the point raised by the hon. Member for Warrington, South about accountability. We want schools to be accountable through their governors, some of whom are elected by parents. That is where the legal obligation will reside. The hon. Gentleman should not imagine that it is disappearing. It is being transferred from the LEAs to the schools. That is why it need not involve the funding agency as such.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. We understand the role of governors. In a sense, it should always have been their role, but some are more active than others. Our point is "quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. In the case of seven, 11 and 14-year-olds, independent auditors will check the accuracy of marking and of teachers' assessments in grant-maintained and LEA schools alike. For example, the Secretary of State has designated the GCSE examining groups to audit marking standards in secondary schools as part of the 1993 tests for 14-year-olds. The guardianship is in a new and different form, as well as with Ofsted. That is in addition to the public information that will be available on a cumulative, year-on-year basis, so that parents can make their own assessments in addition to the arrangements that I have described. There should be no fear about that.<br><br>
It is odd that Opposition Members say that existing inspection regimes—they are run and owned by and accountable to LEAs, but inspect what LEAs do—fall into the same category as that which the hon. Gentleman mentioned in his classical way. Where was the guardianship under the old inspection regime? I should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be more relaxed and content about the new guardianship under the independent aegis of Ofsted, which surely is a step forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to what the Minister said, there was a genuine difficulty in the LEAs about inspectorate role and advisory service. Sometimes they performed a dual function and it was not always well thought out. In the very best authorities, such as West Riding, the advisory service helped teachers in the classrooms to overcome problems. I hope that that function will not be removed.<br><br>
Guardianship came from the education committees and, more importantly, from the parents in the long run. I want to know if the new auditors are to be moderators—I go back to the days when I was the general secretary of the West Yorks and Lindsey examining board. Will the auditors be moderators of that order, taking samples, or will they look at every marking system? What samples have been decided upon? It is important that the auditors are defined; it may even get rid of many of our worries about the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot describe the techniques that the auditors will use because, I freely confess to the Committee, I am not aware of them. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman giving him as much information as I can, but it is not at my fingertips. I am trying to reassure Opposition Members that sufficient provisions have been made in different ways, at different levels and with different institutional arrangements to make the amendment unnecessary. I ask hon. Members to think again about the implications of the amendment which enhances the function of the funding agency for schools in ways that I would not be happy about. They may be uncertain about that too, and, if so, might want to reconsider the amendment. If they do not do so, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response to the debate. He assumes that the system that has already been set up is satisfactory, yet the evidence is that the establishment of the national curriculum and the standard assessment tests have hit serious teething troubles in the past four years, which have resulted in the Government making changes both in their approach to the national curriculum and to SATs. I believe that SATs have now been abolished because an American company threatened to take the Government to court over the use of their copyright name, I do not know whether they felt that the Government's product was inferior and would impugn their reputation. I believe that in future they will be called national curriculum tests.<br><br>
As the Minister rightly said, the amendment would give the funding agency an additional power. We are opposed to the funding agency and the funding council for Wales on principle, because the Government are proposing a particular line and encouraging a solution that we, and the educational world, are not convinced is preferable to what happens in the maintained system.<br><br>
If we are to have a funding agency and a funding council, let us ensure that they do an effective job. By seeking this information, they could complement the part played by Ofsted and the governors of grant-maintained schools. That fits in well with the clause and with the undertaking to have an exchange of information between LEAs and the funding agency.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The Government should try to get this matter right. They must be aware of the debate bubbling away about the way in which the national curriculum is working and about the real value of the testing process. David Pascall, the new chair of the National Curriculum Council, made it clear as recently as September 1992 that he believes that there are problems with the national curriculum. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The more the NCC has listened to teachers talk about their work, the more convinced we have become that the concerns are not just teething problems inevitable in the period of transition."</p></blockquote>
There is obviously a more fundamental problem, which the chairman of the National Curriculum Council does not think is merely the result of transitional introductory problems. That must be tackled.<br><br>
A duty on the funding agency and the funding council to collect information will not, by itself, solve that problem. This annual check need not be a detailed, in-depth study of every school; that will be done on a four-yearly rota by the new inspectorate, although it is debatable whether there will be enough inspectors to carry out those inspections. We believe that the funding agency could have an important complementary role.<br><br>
The National Curriculum Council, which is a major Government body, says that there is a fundamental case to answer on the way in which the national curriculum has been introduced. It is not only the national curriculum, but the tests associated with it. Two important surveys have recently been carried out. They were paid for by the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association and the National Union of Teachers. The survey for AMMA was carried out independently by Warwick university, and the survey for the NUT was carried out by Leeds university. The survey on the national curriculum and SATS carried out by the school of education at Leeds was interesting because it was done by Professor Robin Alexander and Dr. Diane Shorrocks using a similar methodology and sample size to that which they had used previously in a report for the School Examinations and Assessment Council. Unfortunately, the Government have not published the SEAC report, despite the time spent on it.<br><br>
Our amendment would not require such a level of research to be done every year, but it would help the funding agency to keep a watching brief on the use of SATS in schools. The Leeds survey found that an average class of 28.8 pupils—I would hate to be the 0.8 of a pupil—needed 75 hours to take the year II SATS instead of the 30 hours estimated by the Government. If the funding agency collated information annually, that is the type of information that they could obtain from schools. It would give the agency a picture of what is happening on the ground without having to have in-dept inspections by Ofsted.<br><br>
These results might be queried on the ground of teacher inexperience, but the teachers involved in the survey had an average of 15 years experience a piece and not one of them believed that the time spent on SATs was well spent. SATs have been in operation for a few years, but unfortunately the Government did not publish the original report. The amendment would help to make such information available. Not only did the teachers believe that the time was not well spent, nearly half of them regarded it as a worrying loss of teaching time. Those tests have been carried out for a few years but it is only because of this independent survey that such information has come
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
to light. If our amendment were accepted, that information might be made available each year as a matter of course. We could then monitor progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman attempted to assess the resources or mechanisms that would be required to fulfill the aims of the amendment? That would help members of the Committee to make a judgment on the amendment. I have put my arguments to the Committee. Has the hon. Gentleman any feel for the scale of the exercise to collect, analyse and use the information that he has in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we have not tabled detailed guidelines. The Government have not yet fully developed their ideas on how the system, such as the common funding formula, will work. We envisage a straightforward response from schools. They would be checked regularly. We would not pore over each set of results but we could check out matters that worried us. We do not envisage a huge bureaucracy.<br><br>
A detailed study has already been carried out into the working of the SATs but, unfortunately, the Government have refused to publish it. The amendment would enable schools to tell the funding agency what is going on. The funding agency could determine whether the information was satisfactory. I have not worked out the details of how it might operate—I have stressed that we consider this to be a complementary part of the process—but the funding agency could use the information to invite Ofsted to look into particular problems. Some of the work that has been done shows that serious shortcomings exist and that there is anxiety among teachers, who must ensure that the national curriculum is delivered effectively in the classroom so that children get a rounded education.<br><br>
The evidence is that the demands of testing cause serious problems: 79 per cent. of teachers said that children had been frustrated by lack of attention, while 93 per cent. said that they were able to spend less time with those children who needed extra help. No teachers wanted the exercise repeated the following year, and just over half felt that the testing should be for optional use in support of a teacher's assessment of pupils. The Government are putting the experience of classroom teachers to use in Scotland, where there is a different approach to delivery of the national curriculum and to ensuring that children get a quality education.<br><br>
The report that I have just mentioned was conducted by the school of education at Leeds university, which had already conducted a previous survey for the Government. It used the same methodology on a sample of exactly the same size and came to much the same conclusions as the report that the Government refused to publish. It will be interesting to see whether SEAC will be allowed to publish that report. Another survey—the Warwick survey—seems to back up the Leeds study, which was sponsored by the NUT.<br><br>
The Warwick survey, conducted for AMMA, found that 64 per cent. of key stage 1 teachers considered that a lack of time was the main obstacle to implementing the national curriculum, while 31 per cent. thought that the central problem was large classes. That means 95 per cent. of teachers believed that those were the two main problems with implementation. The amendment would mean that the funding agency would be able to gather such information through questioning schools. The Warwick survey also showed that overloading the national
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
curriculum is preventing five to seven-year-olds from receiving the broad and balanced education to which they are legally entitled under the 1988 Act. The pressures of the testing arrangements are forcing schools to concentrate on the core subjects of English, maths and science, while other subjects such as history, geography and religious education are not receiving enough time to be taught properly. In Wales, we have the additional challenge of ensuring that Welsh is taught in a sympathetic and encouraging manner.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
I undertook a brief survey of the primary schools in my constituency after the first round of SATs. Only one primary school head teacher said that he was able to cope successfuly with the SATs. The remaining head teachers said that there were tremendous pressures of time: they felt that if they were to teach the non-core parts of the curriculum in a proper and substantial way for children, that would put pressure on the time that they could give to teaching the core subjects. They felt that the fundamentals—in maths and English in particular—had to be dealt with properly. They were being pulled this way and that in attempting to deliver the national curriculum effectively and to give children in their care a quality education.<br><br>
The responses from the head teachers were not 10 or 20 pages: often, they were just a page of pithy, precise and accurate comments about the way in which the system was working. The Minister spoke of the time and resources that would be involved under the amendment. From my experience in dealing with the schools in my constituency, and all the other things that come the way of any Member of Parliament, I believe that the funding agency, with a reasonable staff, would be able to cope with the duties that we would give them under amendment No. 78.<br><br>
The surveys show that the curriculum, in its present form, is undeliverable. Teachers were working an average of 52·4 hours a week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish we could do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, it would be wonderful if we could do that. Every weekend I think of ways of devising a system for allocating my time so that Sunday evenings are totally free. It never quite comes off. I agree that most Members of Parliament work well over 50 hours a week and it is said, from time to time, that teachers are overpaid, get long holidays and are in school for only a few hours a day. In fact, teachers work hours that are well beyond what are typically regarded, in the outside world, as standard hours. Even though they were working 52·4 hours a week, the teachers still did not feel satisfied that they were meeting both the test requirements and the requirement to provide a responsible time for all national curriculum subjects.<br><br>
The conscientiousness of teachers in working beyond the call of duty enables the system to continue. The lesson of the surveys is that there is a point when the system cracks and teachers are unable to continue to work at that rate. The amendment would provide an opportunity for schools to respond regularly—although not in as much depth as in the survey—about their work in fulfiling the national curriculum and meeting the Government's targets on assessment and testing. Teachers have to cope with constant change. There are plans for more changes. For example, the national curriculum orders for English and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
technology are to be revised. Next year, schools will be required to publish key stage 1, 2 and 3 results. We await a circular about that.<br><br>
The funding authorities should carry out the functions described in the amendment to enable schools to respond and provide information. That would enable the funding authority to call on Ofsted or SEAC, or the unified body that the Bill will create, and say, "Look, there's a problem here—deal with it". That is the purpose of the amendment, which is in the spirit of clause 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment calls on the Secretary of State to:
<br><blockquote><p>"provide the Secretary of State with information each year to show that each school funded by a funding authority is fulfilling the requirements of any statutory instrument relating to the National Curriculum, and undertaking Standard Assessment Tests under the Education Reform Act 1988."</p></blockquote>
It is worth reminding the Committee of the argument that the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) presented on 1 December 1987 on Second Reading of the Education Reform Act 1988. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are proposing a curriculum which
<ul>
<li>'(a) promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society; and</li>
<li>(b) prepares such pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life.'"</li>
</ul></p></blockquote>
The former Secretary of State for Education continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not intend to lay down how lessons should be taught, how timetables should be organised, or which text books should be used."</p></blockquote>
Later in the debate, he stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are establishing the framework of a core curriculum and foundation subjects, and expect children to take those subjects to 16."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose of the national curriculum is to provide a broad-based and relevant curriculum."</p></blockquote>
On assessment and testing, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We seek a balanced package of assessment arrangements, including national tests. It has three purposes: first, to tell the parent or teacher what a child knows, is able to do and is able to understand; secondly to identify problems which need further diagnosis and whether the child needs extra help or more demanding tasks; thirdly, to indicate through the results of assessment the achievements of schools and local education authorities generally."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 1 December 1987; Vol. 123, c. 773–75.]</p></blockquote>
Those were the specific points about the national curriculum.<br><br>
Those aims were included in the 1988 Act. Section 1(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) It shall be the duty—
<ol>
<li>of the Secretary of State as respects every maintained school;</li>
<li>of every local education authority as respects every school maintained by them; and</li>
<li>of every governing body or head teacher of a maintained school as respects that school;</li>
</ol>
to exercise their functions (including, in particular, the functions conferred on them by this Chapter with respect to religious education, religious worship and the National Curriculum) with a view to securing that the curriculum for the school satisfies the requirements of this section."</p></blockquote>
Unless that section has been repealed, when the funding agency for schools takes over from LEAs the responsibility for providing sufficient education places for children aged five to 15 and for providing revenue and capital grants to schools, and when it can consider closing or significantly changing schools, it will be absolved of its responsibility to provide the Secretary of State with the information that he requires to carry out his statutory duties under the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
Education Reform Act 1988. The amendment should be accepted, as it would enable the Secretary of State to carry out his statutory duties.<br><br>
If the Under-Secretary of State for Schools rejects the amendment, it will confirm Opposition Members' belief that he considers that the funding agency for schools should be only financially accountable. It will be clear that he is not interested in having it provide the information that would assure the Government that the national curriculum is being delivered and that standard attainment tasks are being fulfilled. He might also fear that acceptance of the amendment would confirm some of Opposition Members' anxiety about the national curriculum and the problems with SATs. The amendment would have the effect of allowing the Secretary of State to have access to information that would allay our fears. That is why I support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The local education authorities currently have many awesome responsibilities which, by and large, they fulfil very well. We are worried that a vacuum will be left when a large number of schools become grant maintained. As I said at a previous sitting, the local education authorities have been most helpful in implementing Government policies, including the local management of schools, the national curriculum and many others. Local education authorities ensure that policies become the practice in schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth spoke about the work of advice and inspection that LEAs do. The quality of that work may vary from authority to authority, but in the main it has been good.<br><br>
Generally, school governors offer excellent support. However, by and large they are lay people. They are not professionals, and do not have a complete and intricate knowledge of the education system. Governors have told me of the difficulty of trying to keep up with the many changes in school law. I am sure that all hon. Members have heard similar stories. Indeed, many people who are paid to keep up with the law have had great difficulty in remaining fully aware of, and involved in, every change. It is a tall order for governors to keep a check on all the minutiae of the changes that have been introduced. That is why the local education authorities do such a good job. They ensure that the professionals in a school implement policy as fully as possible.<br><br>
Many local education authorities have kept their schools advisory service going, and, in my own county, they regularly review and inspect schools. They are constantly aware of the progress of schools. We are worried that when we have four-yearly inspections those schools will not be inspected for long periods and that the governors will have the awesome task of ensuring that the law is being implemented in their schools. That role may be more than most governing bodies can cope with on their own without the guidance of the local education authority.<br><br>
If a child entered a secondary school at 11 and the inspection had just taken place, it would be another four years before the next inspection and that child would be half way through his GCSEs. It could be a further year before improvements were made as a result of recommendations. That child's whole secondary school lifetime would have passed by without any monitoring.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
We are worried that schools will not be monitored, other than within the limited monitoring undertaken by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
the governing body. The funding agency should have the power to require that such reports are made available so that it can make recommendations if required.<br><br>
We shall deliberate carefully on the Minister's comments. I am sure that we shall return to this matter later because it is essential and one of the most important aspects of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 2, line 39, at end insert—
<ul>
<li>(2A) A funding authority shall make such reports and returns, and give such information, to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools for England or Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools for Wales as either of these may require for the exercise of his functions.'.</li></ul>
The hon. Member for Hemsworth remarked on the clarity of the White Paper "Choice and Diversity". I should like to give my opinion, and I am happy for the Minister to pass my remarks on to the Secretary of State. I, too, found the document very clear. However, it was also said that it is rarely referred to, so it might be helpful to begin my remarks on the amendment by citing the opening page which contains a foreword by the Prime Minister. He talks about the
<br><blockquote><p>"drive for higher standards in schools"</p></blockquote>
and he ends by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Excellence must be the key word in all our schools; that is what our children deserve. That is what we intend to achieve."</p></blockquote>
[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear".] I join hon. Members in their approval because I applaud those remarks. However, I do not believe that the White Paper or the Bill will achieve that.<br><br>
Paragraph 15.5 on the last page of the White Paper says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Regular and rigorous inspection will similarly provide a benchmark for each school, and a spur to greater quality."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, we all agree that we need a drive for quality and excellence for all, but I genuinely do not believe that the Bill, with the chaos and division it will bring to our schools, will lead to improvments in quality and to excellence for all.<br><br>
I share the Government's view that inspections are a vital tool in improving quality. The provisions of the Education (Schools) Act 1992 weaken the quality assurance role of LEAs with respect to county and voluntary schools. I am anxious that, with the four-yearly cycle, there will no longer be a link between the identification of problems and the people who seek solutions to them. Previously, that was done by the local authority inspectors or advisers. The situation would have been worse had it not been for the amendments made on Report in the House of Lords. They made it possible for LEAs to continue to be involved in inspection.<br><br>
With the growth of the grant-maintained sector, small though it is at present, there has been an attack on the central services that can be provided by LEAs because of the money being taken away and the loss of economies of scale. It is already difficult for LEAs to become heavily involved in quality assurance for their schools. However it is difficult to know what other quality assurance mechanisms exist for grant-maintained schools. It must be the Government's intention that the quality assurance mechanisms for the grant-maintained school sector will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
largely be the work of Ofsted, although they will, rightly, point to the role of the school governing bodies in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point about quality control is important. Is he not suggesting, too, that the Ofsted reports will be published? The funding authority will take them into account when they decide funding policies. If Ofsted goes into a school in year one and finds a disaster area, it will not wait another four years before it returns. It will lay down a programme of remdial action for that school and keep a check on it, as HMI does now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what the hon. Gentleman says. We may have debates in Committee about the frequency of the inspection, and argue about the framework within which those inpsections will operate. We may argue about who the inspectors will be but there is no disagreement about the fundamental principle that there is a benefit to be gained from inspection and from the publication of the reports. The benefit is not only to the individual school—the publication of reports is one way to pass on examples of good practice. There is no disagreement between the hon. Member for Battersea and me on that issue. However, as I shall illustrate, the amendment is vital because of the way in which Ofsted can seek information from the funding authorities rather than the other way round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that a school was inspected in a particular year, and immediately afterwards the head teacher of that school resigned and was replaced by another, much less successful head. It would be another four years before the next inspection. That could mean that the whole of the school life of a particular pupil could have been spent in conditions of relative failure before any remedial action was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman bears out what I said earlier, that while we do not disagree about the benefits of inspection in the generality, we have significant anxieties about its mechanics and the frequency with which it takes place. I shall not pursue the point as to go into more detail would be out of order. Inspections are an opportunity, through the publication of a report, to spread good practice. Professor Stewart Sutherland, the new HMCI made that point in an article in <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> on 20 November. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"inspections help to spread good practice across the system by highlighting strengths and identifying weakness in the management and performance of schools".</p></blockquote>
I agree with that, although I disagree with some of the mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about the dissimilation of information, for which the amenment is partly designed. I commend to the hon. Gentleman a series of books on primary education which is already published by HMI. There is a wealth of information about primary education—my daughter said that she found them the most helpful books in her first year of teaching at a primary school. Perhaps the Government should do more to promote those books in schools because they are not as well known as they should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing to the Committee's attention that series of books. I am sure that he is aware that since its foundation in 1839, HMI has done invaluable work and has produced many

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
excellent reports over that long time. Although I am not familiar with the details of the series to which the hon. Gentleman referred, I am familiar with many others.<br><br>
There is nothing strange about the concept of close liaison among various bodies involved in the education process: that has been established for a long time. In a letter dated 8 September 1992 to the new chief inspector of schools, the Secretary of State makes specific reference for the need for Ofsted to work closely with the National Curriculum Council and with the School Examinations and Assessment Council. He states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have no doubt that there will continue to be close and mutually beneficial working between all parts of the DFE and your office on a day-to-day basis."</p></blockquote>
That crucial remark shows the close working relationship between all parts of the DFE which—if the Bill is passed—will include the funding authorities and Ofsted.<br><br>
Ofsted will need to gather information from different sources to enable it to do its job properly; to ensure that it is fulfilling its remit. There needs to be a two-way relationship between Ofsted and the other parts of the DFE.<br><br>
From the same letter of 8 September 1992, the Secretary of State writes to Professor Sutherland:
<br><blockquote><p>"You and your staff have new roles of central importance, which build on but go well beyond the functions carried out by Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools since its establishment in 1839 … The hard and public evidence from the inspections you are to arrange will provide all schools with an incentive for improvement"—</p></blockquote>
that point was raised by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis)—
<br><blockquote><p>"as well as setting their agenda for action."</p></blockquote>
That extract highlights the two-way relationship: gathering information that will provide the necessary incentive through the reports for improvement and setting the agenda for action for those schools as they progress. The funding authorities will be concerned to have information from Ofsted which relates to the new agendas for action of the schools and Ofsted will need information from the funding authorities to enable it to carry out its task.<br><br>
What information will Ofsted want from the funding authorities? Let us consider the "Framework for the Inspection of Schools" which Professor Sutherland published and circulated. It refers to a range of issues that are relevant to the funding agency for schools. For example, Professor Sutherland wishes input indicators to include information about: overall unit costs per pupil when compared with the national average; expenditure per pupil on books, materials and equipment; and annual recurrent funding from
<br><blockquote><p>"the LEA, DFE or other funding body."</p></blockquote>
That clear reference to other funding bodies includes the funding authorities.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
We are told by the chief inspector of schools that he has assured parents and schools that inspectors will examine and report on all crucial aspects of the school. To achieve that, he will need to gather data about individual schools from a wide range of sources, which must include the funding authorities. It is vital that the funding authorities provide Ofsted with information through HMCI.<br><br>
I accept that Conservative Members probably agree that the link between the funding authorities and HMCI is vital. When I spoke about another amendment, I was able to anticipate the Minister's argument against it by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
referring to what has become our bible—"Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments". I have examined the document carefully to ascertain which part the Minister will use as his excuse for rejecting the amendment. However, I cannot find a let-out clause for the Minister in the guide. He stated clearly in a previous debate that Ofsted was distinct from the Department for Education. He accepts the importance of specifying in clause 5 bodies, such as local education authorities, which will receive information from the funding authorities. I am unable to pinpoint the Minister's objection to the amendment and I look forward to his response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is modest and I hope that the Government will consider it. All that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) suggests is that the funding authority should provide a report, or any information that HMCI and his counterpart for Wales, request.<br><br>
I am sure that the grant-maintained sector will not expand in the way described by the Minister during the past 10 days. However, the measure will be used if such expansion occurs. In that case the funding authority should be responsible for providing HMCI with any necessary information.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath has covered most of the reasons for accepting the amendment. I shall mention some others. Quality assurance will be difficult to obtain under the Bill. Surprisingly for a Government who are supposed to be in favour of improving standards and of raising the quality of education in our schools, the Bill is silent about quality assurance and monitoring schools. One of our main worries about the Bill is that it is bureaucratic and organisational. It makes no effort to deal with the questions of quality and standards in the school classroom. A report such as is specified in the amendment would help to bring such matters out into the open.<br><br>
Conservative Members may argue that greater competition for pupils between schools will raise standards. The dogmatic belief in the market system is that standards will rise because of the discipline of the market. In a country whose biggest selling daily newspaper is <i>The Sun,</i> it is difficult to see how the market can guarantee quality. There is no evidence that the grant-maintained sector has been responsible for raising standards, nor any to show that such schools operate at a higher level of standards and quality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman refers to the debate on Second Reading he will find that words were used then—perhaps even by myself—which answer his question—which probably he posed then and is recycling now. It was made clear that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had referred to inspectorate reports which showed that, even at this early stage of development, grant-maintained schools were proving to be a great success in almost every respect and that they were an improvement on what had gone before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not quite what was said on Second Reading, as the <i>Hansard</i> record will show. I now have the opportunity that I did not have on Second Reading—because the Minister would not let me intervene on his winding-up speech—to press the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has the Floor.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. There are more people in the Room this evening than were in the Chamber on Second Reading.<br><br>
The Minister referred to a general report from Her Majesty's inspectorate on the operation of the grant-maintained sector, which said that the levels being achieved in that sector were better than the average in maintained schools. I accept that that is so, but it is also what one would expect, given that about 35 per cent. of grant-maintained schools select pupil intake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I know what the hon. Gentleman is trying to say, but it is not correct. If we are discussing the Second Reading debate we should refresh our memories about it, but we are both at the same disadvantage so I suppose that that is okay. I am pretty certain that the report offered evidence that, since they became grant maintained, schools had improved in some key respects—in intangible matters such as morale, and in tangible matters such as an improved supply of books. That reflected the different priorities exercised by the governors as opposed to the LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case, but I was asking whether standards clearly had been raised in those schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may recall that I mentioned some figures from grant-maintained schools. They showed that there had been a significant improvement in examination results and in areas such as truancy and attendance. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the motivating factor for higher standards in grant-maintained schools. He mentioned competition in a somewhat cynical vein. The motivating factor is that parents know that, in grant-maintained schools, their governing body has greater control over what goes on in the school and thereby hold it accountable for the standards achieved to a greater extent than in a non-grant-maintained school. As a result, the governing body of a grant-maintained school will take more seriously the results of four-yearly inspections than the governors of a non-grant-maintained school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that governing bodies are crucial to the well-being and development of the school. However, I am not convinced that grant-maintained status is necessary for that. There are many examples of maintained schools whose governing bodies are doing that job extremely well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this will be the last time that I have to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's speech. I can now ride to our mutual rescue because a document has suddenly fallen into my hands. It is a letter from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw). It is the very passage for which we have both been groping, so I can now quote it authoritatively.
<br><blockquote><p>"Thus HMI have observed not only that in GM schools the proportion of lessons judged satisfactory or better is greater than that in maintained schools generally, but also that since becoming grant-maintained the schools have generally deployed their resources to good effect so as to secure continuing improvements; that the demand for places in the majority of schools has increased since the change of status; that pupils' behaviour and attendance in GM schools are generally commendable; and that teachers' morale has improved."</p></blockquote>
Those points were made on Second Reading and on them we rest our case.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are very important matters and they lead me on to say that there are 342 grant-maintained schools—is it still 342?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, 345.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been a bad week if it had not gone beyond 342. However, we should remind ourselves that 24,647 schools have not yet opted out. I accept that there probably has been an increased demand for places in grant-maintained schools, because parents think that they receive additional grant to which maintained schools do not have access. Those schools are now full to capacity—in fact, they are over-subscribed. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) referred to Baverstock school, which now faces a greater demand for places than it can meet. Such schools can decide which pupils to take. Whether intentionally or not, they select the more able pupils. I am worried that if the grant-maintained sector expands, such practice will be rife.<br><br>
Amendment No. 68 deals with reports. Quality in the grant-maintained sector will be relevant. We need to be open about whether standards have improved in individual grant-maintained schools. We had an interesting discussion about whether standards have improved in the generality of schools in the sector. Grant-maintained schools are currently inspected by Her Majesty's inspectors. There is no obligation for those reports to be made public. In some cases, HMI has visited the school for a lengthy period at great cost to the public purse, but we are not given the findings.<br><br>
It may be useful if I gave some examples of the cost to the Exchequer of those inspections. Rickmansworth school in Hertfordshire has had the equivalent of 17 days inspection at a cost of £6,030 but no public report has been issued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a crucial issue. One of the great clarion calls from Conservative Members is for the publication of information. Is my hon. Friend saying that reports of inspections of grant-maintained schools have not been made available to the public, who cannot therefore know how well or how badly the schools are doing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Several schools have been inspected on many occasions but no report has been made public. It is difficult to reconcile that position with the Prime Minister's stated objective of open Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the argument is that parent power can be exercised through knowledge of the school and by the ability directly to influence its management, a refusal to publish an inspectorate report is a fundamental break in that chain of logic. Without the report, parents cannot exercise an intelligent choice about the standards operating in the school.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Government are hiding behind the smokescreen of grant-maintained status, which they claim will in itself improve standards. It is a source of anxiety that an independent body such as Her Majesty's inspectorate goes into the schools, not for a day or half a day, but for a considerable time, yet no report is published. That raises questions about the standards attained in the schools.<br><br>
I mentioned Rickmansworth school, and I shall cite one or two more examples, which make my point. Bankfield
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
high school in Cheshire has had 24 days of inspection by HMI, at a cost to the public purse of £6,840, but no report was published. In the past 12 months, the London Nautical school was inspected by HMI for 27 days at a cost to the public purse of nearly £10,000. Once again, no report was published. Baverstock school in Birmingham—our favourite school—had 29, the greatest number of days of inspection by HMI, and no report has been published.<br><br>
I accept that there is no legal obligation to publish those reports, but if the HMI inspection had showed that standards had risen dramatically, the Government would not have kept quiet about it. HMI has not said that standards have improved in the schools inspected, even though up to 29 days were spent at the schools. The amendment would require the funding authority, at a request from HMI, to make the details of the inspection public. It is part of the process of openness and of giving parents the information on which to make an informed decision. At present, they do not have even half the picture.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) made clear earlier the Labour party's position on the publication of examination results. Many good LEAs have, for many years, provided all the necessary information for parents to take proper, informed decisions and judge whether schools operate effectively. The amendment is part of an opening-up process to ensure that all the relevant information is available so that parents, members of the public, and taxpayers will know whether they are getting value for money from the schools. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 68 would ensure that the funding agency for schools provides HMCI with relevant information. It would bring to the Bill some of the requirements of the Education (Schools) Act 1992. The hon. Member for Bath referred to the document issued by Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools, "Framework for the Inspection of Schools"—the statutory requirement or basis on which inspections by registered inspectors will take place. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The function of inspection set out in the Education (Schools) Act 1992 is to report on: the quality of education provided by schools; the educational standards achieved in those schools; whether the financial resources made available to the school are managed efficiently; the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils at those schools."</p></blockquote>
It is not unreasonable to ask that the funding agency for schools provides Her Majesty's chief inspector with sufficient and relevant information to carry out its role that is described by statute.<br><br>
HMCI is charged with the responsibility of producing national data, which will be grouped in various ways to provide relevant comparisons. The "Introduction to the Framework" states that the grouping is to be done
<br><blockquote><p>"by phase, primary or secondary: by size of school: by age-range: by type of providing authority, ie Shire, County, Metropolitan Borough, London Borough"—</p></blockquote>
I think that is an important point—
<br><blockquote><p>"by enrolment principle, ie selective, non-selective, comprehensive: by type of school, ie county, maintained special, voluntary controlled, voluntary aided and special agreement, grant maintained, City Technology College and other independent."</p></blockquote>
The HMCI will be required to publish that information nationally. He will also need that information from the funding agency for schools. When HMCI is providing his reports, he will need to know from the funding agency the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
size of classes in the grant-maintained primary schools, if there are any. He will also need to know the size of classes in grant-maintained secondary schools, of which there are some now.<br><br>
Later we shall discuss the special needs phase, in which I have a special interest. The Bill gives the opportunity for special schools to opt-out and come under the auspices of the funding agency for schools. Therefore, it is important that the funding agency has that information and then passes it to HMCI so that he carries out his statutory responsibilities.<br><br>
The results from that information about class sizes will be of interest to educationists across the country. The information will also be interesting if it shows that the funding agency for schools has used the powers included in the Bill to change the character of the schools under its control. We have already dealt with that issue in previous debates: that information would be brought nationally to HMCI of schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 68 is extremely relevant because it addresses other education statutes. It is not unreasonable to ask that the funding agency for schools provides such information to HMCI. There have been several moves in the Committee to resist the provision of information and introduce accountability. The Minister continually claims that that responsibility is somewhere else in the Bill—it is dealt with in other clauses. The Minister can, and should, accept our plain and straight-forward amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are all important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even the Minister will accept that some are more important than others—some he tries to answer and others he simply dismisses as being of lesser importance. So, in the heirarchy of such things, this is an important amendment. The concept of the role of inspection as a support mechanism for schools, maintaining and improving good schools and picking out failing schools, is fundamental, both in education and in the White Paper. Later on in our proceedings we shall discuss failing schools, and the importance to them of the inspection system and its mechanisms. The Minister complained about too few quotes from the White Paper, so I shall turn to that document now. The Secretary of State seems to be having a good day, so I hope that my remarks about how amazingly well written the White Paper is will be passed on to him.<br><br>
The White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under the Education (Schools) Act 1992, an independent inspection of the quality of teaching and the standards achieved in all maintained schools will be made every four years. This will lead to a published report highlighting strengths and weaknesses. Schools will have to publish a plan of action to tackle the weaknesses identified by the inspectors and report on progress to parents every year."</p></blockquote>
That is germane to some of the points raised already by my hon. Friends. If they are to receive a report on progress every year, parents should be entitled to know what the inspection found to be unsatisfactory in the first place. If the reports are not placed in the public domain, it will be impossible for parents to use the inspectors' reports to put pressure on the school's governing body and head teacher. Most parents have considerable difficulty in determining the quality of the schools attended by their children. My children are at different levels of education and I am aware of a constant anxiety among parents as to whether schools
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
are failing children. However, as a parent one has little opportunity to find out. The role of inspection is central to the education system.<br><br>
That role is even more important in opted-out schools. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest made one of his occasional contributions on that subject. There are all sorts of arguments about whether grant-maintained schools are an improvement. It would be surprising if the first tranche of such schools did not have a high degree of motivation. Whatever our overall views of opting out and of its effect on the whole system, the process has attractions—at least initially—for some schools. It would be surprising if some head teachers and governing bodies did not feel motivated by the process.<br><br>
The question is not whether a few hundred schools can operate successfully on an opted-out basis but whether opting out is a viable structure across the board. Will the average school under an opted-out system be as good as, or better than, the average under the existing system? The difficulty is that the Bill does not contain adequate procedures to deal with grant-maintained schools that begin to fail. There is a clear structure for picking up county and voluntary schools that move into what the Bill defines as a period of failure. For those schools, the process of inspection is important. It triggers the definition of failure, but before that happens many ways of avoiding it will have been tried.<br><br>
The Association of County Councils has pointed out that the block-buster approach to failing schools could be used in extremis, but it is not the norm. Usually, advisers from the LEA and inspectors visit a failing school to help it to re-establish itself and to raise standards before provisions such as those described in the Bill are used.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
There are no parallel provisions for the grant-maintained structure. There is no mechanism to deal with failing schools apart from changing the governors or closing the school. The latter option is an extreme method of remedying failure. It should not be a first approach. If the Bill provides for any other mechanism to tackle failing grant-maintained schools, I should be grateful if the Minister pointed it out.<br><br>
If I am right and the only mechanism for dealing with failing schools is closure based on regular inspections, the role of the inspectorate becomes more important for opted-out schools than for LEA or voluntary schools. Proper transmission of information is, therefore doubly important. The hon. Member for Bath and I discussed what the hon. Member for Battersea said earlier about a school that fails between inspections. The issue will not divide the Committee: we are discussing a technical matter, not a political issue. A school could begin to fail after one inspection and continue to fail until the next four-yearly inspection. In the LEA structure, such a failure would be arrested before the end of that four-year period because a constant dialogue exists between LEAs and schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised that point on Second Reading. Quality should be monitored and problems should be spotted long before an extreme solution is necessary. The hon. Gentleman is considering what I hope will be rare cases. Even if the head teacher is changed, which may cause a school to go downhill—that should not happen,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
because the head has been appointed by the governors and the school community—four-year inspections, governors' control, parental involvement and local advisory services should alert people within and beyond the community to any problems. I wish to explore that further. However, many checks and balances are already built into the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Such checks and balances make the current system work, the system does not work when those checks and balances are not applied correctly. If schools can fail under the present system and we are trying to define a mechanism to deal in extremis with county or voluntary schools how will a failing opt-out school be tackled? Under the Bill, one answer is to change the governing body, but it cannot go through the process outlined in the Bill for voluntary or LEA schools, because opt-out schools are specifically taken out of that system. In extremis the school will be closed. It should be considered a very unusual step to close a school because of failures. There might be other reasons, such as dilapidated buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman share my genuine concern that in the gap between one inspection and another, the possibility of failure is more likely in a grant-maintained school than in an LEA school? LEA schools may be battered but the LEA will still provide support through the advisory and inspection service. It is a widespread service, but it is not available in the same way to grant-maintained schools. Grant-maintained schools might be able to purchase that service, but it might have disappeared because of the attacks and, more importantly, they will only be allowed to purchase it for a maximum of two years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The opt-out structure may be tolerable or successful schools but is doubly damning for the school that is beginning to struggle. The real test will not be after a couple of years, but when the grant-maintained system moves into a mature phase. In the medium term, we shall have to allow for heads and staff growing older and their enthusiasm at 8 am not being what it once was. That is the reality of human institutions. It is part of the reason for the cycle of failure. Those challenging questions must be answered by opt-out schools.<br><br>
Conservative Members will argue that parental control enables governors in opt-out schools to be more incisive, which will save those schools from that cycle of failure. That credits the Government with a great understanding of what is happening in schools. A genuine dilemma for parents and governors is that it is difficult for a voluntary governor to know what is going on in the school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be right, but parents and governors should know what is happening in the school, as well as the head—assuming that it has a good head. There may be a problem in one subject area. If we assume that the published results are accurate, the area that needs support will be identified. Any head worth his or her salt will apply to the advisory service—either the existing service or a new service perhaps serving a number of boroughs—to ensure that that support for teachers is available. That is how to remedy the subject problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I happily accept that, but I think that what we are all driving at is the importance of the inspection system as one of the legs on which rests the maintenance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
of standards in all types of schools. None of us wants opted-out schools to fail because they would be failing their pupils. We think that there are better ways to run the education system, but it is in no one's interest for those schools to fail. The role of inspection is fundamental.<br><br>
The central point of the amendment is that inspections should not be discrete and take place over a long period, but should be part of the organic life of the school and the education system. Obviously, schools look to the funding agency, but when it has information it must be sped to Ofsted and the schools inspectorate to ensure that the inspectorate is capable of monitoring outside the four-yearly period when necessary. That is one of the many checks that we want built into the system to ensure success and prevent a lurch into failure.<br><br>
The amendment would ensure a flow of information throughout the system. That would allow the decisions on which the Minister claims the new system depends to be made. That duty would not place an onerous burden on the funding agency and it is only common sense to require it to transmit information that can be useful. We await the Minister's response to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I did not know Opposition Members better, I would be tempted to accuse them of impertinence because the essence of what we have said throughout our proceedings is that there is not enough information. In the light of what has happened in the past week or two, their attitude is pretty breathtaking. Recently, we provided more informtion about education in this country than was ever dreamt of before, and had an overwhelming and positive response from the public and parents. Our rather lop-sided debate has taken place against that background and anyone who entered the Room while it was in progress might have thought that it was about a request for more information from Ofsted. Instead, the amendment relates to Ofsted asking for information from the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
I shall return to that matter in a moment, but I shall first deal with some other points. The hon. Member for Warrington, South gave details about the data that he thought should be extracted from the funding agency for schools. That was the implication of what the hon. Gentleman said, and the thought crossed my mind that virtually all that he asked for is already available in my Department's annual report, documents laid before the House and answers to parliamentary questions about class sizes, parent-teacher ratios and so on. To suggest that Ofsted could not do its job properly unless the amendment could draw that information out of a reluctant funding agency for schools is rather bizarre. That information is already available, perhaps from a different source and in a slightly different form, because my Department produces it. The argument advanced by the hon. Member for Warrington, South had little effect or weight.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) dismissed, in a rather cavalier fashion, the potential power to replace grant-maintained school governors of an identified failing school. In a sense, that is the equivalent of the education association that is proposed in a later part of the Bill. When a grant-maintained school has been identified through the normal inspection process as failing, as defined in the Bill, the power to replace sufficient governors to make dramatic changes in the way in which the school is run is an extremely potent weapon that should not be underestimated.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
I was intrigued by the argument of the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers). I think that he genuinely misunderstood the nature of the existing inspection regime and its aims. None of the visits made by HMI to grant-maintained schools under the present inspection regime has been a formal inspection intended to lead to a published report.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
A full inspection, which normally leads to the publication of a report, would require 50 days for a typical secondary school. Even the considerable number of days that the hon. Gentleman mentioned does not come close to that requirement. Visits such as those that he described are made to various schools on various occasions for specific purposes and, in the normal course of events, do not give rise to a published report.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seemed to be criticising the old-style inspection regime that his party fought so bitterly to defend during our discussion of the Bill that gave rise to the new inspection regime. The hon. Gentleman was not a Member of Parliament at the time, so I exonerate him entirely; the guilty parties are sitting all around him.<br><br>
The new inspection regime will lead to published reports that will be available to parents and governors and will produce a much more open system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is worth recalling that the Government were defeated in the House of Lords on the provision, and that the present inspection arrangements are not those that the Government wanted. They were imposed on the Government by an amendment in the House of Lords, which was described at the time by the Government's education spokesperson in the other place as damaging the Bill. It was said to have been holed below the waterline.<br><br>
I am concerned about the publication of the reports, and the number of days of inspection for which no report is published. In the case of a school such as William Tyndale, which was failing badly, 24 days of inspection were carried out and a formal report was published. It was damning of the school, and rightly so. In that case, 24 days was the trigger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not fruitful for us to engage in a debate on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing inspection regime. That was done in the course of a previous Bill and the issue was resolved.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's comments on the role of another place in the matter demonstrate to us all the value of a second Chamber and the excellent work that it does in scrutinising Bills—including this Bill, I am sure, when it gets to another place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will, but I want to turn to the amendment, which members of the Committee would like to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises an important point about the parliamentary legislative process. Does he anticipate defeats in the House of Lords to improve the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that when the Bill leaves the Committee it will be in such a perfect state that even their Lordships will have difficulty in finding fault with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister remind me how many amendments the Government tabled to the 1988 Act

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
during its passage through the House of Lords? There were, I think, 584 Government amendments. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However many amendments there were, they obviously improved the Bill sufficiently for it to receive the Lords' assent in the end. That is what matters. I see no shame in the Government amending their legislation in the light of debate and consultation and having listened—as we constantly do—to the points made by hon. Members and even by people outside the House. If I consider that the Bill requires Government amendments in Committee, I shall not hesitate to put such amendments before members of the Committee and ask for their support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we look forward to the time when the Minister says, "I accept that the amendment is accurate and I welcome it." Would he, however, welcome two or three of his hon. Friends choosing to exercise their right to amend and improve the Bill? Would he say that that was in the interests of progress?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that if any of my hon. Friends table an amendment, it will receive the attention and care that I give all amendments. If my hon. Friends could persuade me, I would be, I hope, prepared to accept the amendment, as indeed I would be prepared to accept any other amendment, from whichever side of the Committee it came. I make no distinction in this respect. I will look impartially and even-handedly at all amendments, from whichever quarter they may come. If I believe that they strengthen the Bill, I will recommend that the Committee accept them. I have no hang-ups about that. Surely the hon. Gentleman knows me well enough by now to know how open, fair minded and impartial I invariably am. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where's the Whip?"] The fact that the Whip is not here has no bearing whatever on what I am saying. <i>[Laughter.]</i><br><br>
One thing that puzzles me about the amendment is that Ofsted would have no power to require LEAs to provide information. I do not know whether that is an oversight, but to single out the funding agency and fail to give Ofsted similar powers with regard to LEAs is an oddity, to say the least. I should have thought that the opposite argument could be applied. If the flow of information already available to Ofsted from the FAS—information contained in its annual or financial report, for example—is not enough for its purposes, Ofsted is perfectly free, as a Department of State, to request from the funding agency, as an NDPB, further information. I cannot imagine that the FAS would fail to provide any additional information that Ofsted requested. If it did, Ofsted could say to the Secretary of State, "We need, for the full discharge of our responsibilities, further information from the FAS." If that were the case, I cannot imagine that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would hesitate to ask the FAS to provide the additional information.<br><br>
All of this makes about the role and purpose of Ofsted an assumption that is slightly off-beam. Ofsted's main responsibility is to assess and report on the performance of schools. In doing that, I cannot for the life of me see what information Ofsted would require from the FAS that was not already available from other sources, whether from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
increased publication of data, to which my right hon. Friend has said that he will add, or from information available from my Department.<br><br>
Not only do I fail to see the purpose of the amendment, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I can envisage no circumstances in which the information that Ofsted might require from the FAS would not be available. If—as is almost inconceivable—it was not available, Ofsted could go to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and, in that way, obtain the information that it required.<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary. It would add nothing to what is already provided for in the Bill. Therefore, for the reasons that I have outlined on previous occasions, and in view of my assurances I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A couple of things puzzle me about the Minister's response. First, at both the beginning and the end of his remarks, he said that all the information that Ofsted could possibly require would be available from other sources, as well as already being available in his Department. The implication must be that Ofsted is not generating any new information. If that is so, what is the point of having Ofsted at all? It is an additional, unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. If Ofsted is not operating as a prime source of information, what is its purpose?<br><br>
The Minister argued, as he has before in other contexts, that he cannot imagine circumstances in which a body such as Ofsted would not be given whatever it asks for. Incidentally, the Minister said, "Ask and it shall be given" to me about the list of respondents, and I am pleased to say that that list has been placed in the Library. However, he has said that he cannot imagine Ofsted not being given any information for which it asks, so there is no need to place anything in the Bill to ensure that that is so. Why then does clause 5(4) state:
<br><blockquote><p>"A funding authority shall make such reports and returns, and give such information, to any local education authority as the authority may require for the purpose of the exercise of their functions"?</p></blockquote>
Surely the same argument applies to local education authorities as to Ofsted? If such a provision is not included in the Bill for Ofsted, why is it included for local education authorities? To use another phrase that the Minister has used often in this Room, "You can't have it both ways".<br><br>
I think that there is a glimmer of hope that the Minister has accepted the need for information flow in both directions, as he criticised the amendment for not including the flow of information from Ofsted to the funding agencies and to the funding council for Wales. I sense a glimmer of acceptance of the principle of the amendment, and on the strength of that and in the hope of convincing the Minister before we debate the matter again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will know already, Sir John, that Opposition Members oppose the provisions in chapter I for the establishment of a funding agency and a funding council for Wales. However, the provisions in clause 5 are useful and necessary as part of the system that will be established if the Bill is enacted. That is why I wish to put a number of questions to the Minister as to how the system for the provision of information might work. I thought that I would read the notes on clauses provided by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
the Government to see if they offered any further guidance. I am sorry to say that the notes merely reproduced the contents of clause 5 in a different form. They did not at all advance my knowledge of how the system might work.<br><br>
Clause 5 would oblige the funding authority to provide the Secretary of State with information if he requests it and if the authority thinks that he should have it. That system would work under guidelines from the Secretary of State. There is provision for the LEA and the funding agency to provide each other with information on request.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
The skeleton is clear, but how will the system work? When I referred earlier to the funding agency collecting information from schools about the national curriculum and SATs outlined in an amendment, the Minister asked me for details of how the system might work. I said that it had been difficult getting information on how some parts of the Bill might work. The Government should have some idea what information would be of mutual benefit to those involved in carrying out the Government's education policies. I hoped that the Minister might explore with the Committee what information might be exchanged by the funding agency, the Secretary of State and the LEA. This is a genuine request for a bit of flesh to be put on the skeleton. I hope that the Minister will elucidate and enlighten us on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite the Minister's earlier assurances, I am still unhappy about the clause because of how the power is dispersed. I do not object to power being dispersed: in principle, that is a good philosophy. However, in dispersing power, it should not be fragmented because its effect on schools, parents and communities will not be what the Government want.<br><br>
The reports are part of the quality assurance that the Government want. We agree entirely with the aim of quality assurance, but I have difficulty defining the funding agency and its relationship with other agencies. To produce reasonable reports it must have reasonable relations with the other bodies. I read the Minister's full reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), in which he defined funding agencies. I shall relate some of my worries about the definition of the funding agencies and the system of reporting back. The Minister said that the Secretary of State can hand over to the agencies
<br><blockquote><p>"the function of determining proposals by a governing body significantly to change the character or enlarge the premises of a grant-maintained school".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 November 1992; Vol. 214, c. <i>174.</i>]</p></blockquote>
If the character of the school is to be changed, the funding authority will presumably report back on that. What form will the report back take? Will it suddenly make the change and then report back, or will it report beforehand?<br><br>
I give a practical and concrete example. Suppose that the authority were to say of the two voluntary-aided schools in Wakefield metropolitan district—St. Wilfrid's and Thomas A'Becket—that it wished to conduct an experiment in single-sex education. It could demand that Thomas A'Becket became an all-girls school and St. Wilfrid's became an all-boys school. That would be possible. It should be given a report beforehand, explaining why that had happened, arising out of reports written in conjunction with the chief inspector, the local authority, the diocese, the auditors mentioned earlier by the Minister, and representatives of the community—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
although for the purposes of the argument the latter could be the local education authority. That report would give advance warning and a proper discussion could take place, involving parents, the local community and the diocese. However, it would not be satisfactory if the report was issued subsequent to the decision being taken. That is the heart of the dilemma.<br><br>
How do the funding agencies fit in with the other bodies? The Minister said in reply—in one sense, I was delighted to hear it—that they were strictly accountancy bodies. However, in subsequent responses, the Minister gave them more powers than simple accounting. They will do more than add up, give out or take away. They will be able to change the character of a school. Should changes arise simply out of a scale of economy, because it is cheaper to have one all-boys and one all-girls school instead of two mixed schools? That would be entirely feasible if they merely considered the money side of things. Surely, they must look wider, especially in relation to the chief inspector and the local education authority. What sort of reports will they write together and how will they write them?<br><br>
I admit that if we wanted the amendments that we have just withdrawn to have been included in the Bill, we should have written them much more carefully, and drafted them in the style of the Bill. However, that is not always the intention behind amendments, which are rarely accepted fully by the Government. As the Minister stated—he can say it again now that the Whip has gone, because it is not our intention to save his pride—he has no pride whatever and if amendments are right, he will incorporate them into the Bill. The reason for moving the amendments was to introduce two important principles and to see whether, in the 764 amendments that he places before the House of Lords—or will it be two?—the Minister will incorporate the spirit of the amendments.<br><br>
The first amendment requires there to be a simple, clear, direct report that tells us something meaningful about the school. If the funding agencies do not report on SATs or the national curriculum in schools, they nevertheless need to co-ordinate with the other reporting bodies. It would be misleading, and wrong, to have six reports on a school under different headings—one under attendance because of the presence of a specialist; one under the chief inspector; one under the funding agency; one under the local authority and so on. It would be hard on the grant-maintained schools and prevent them from being as successful as the Minister wants them to be.<br><br>
No matter how much I opposed it originally, when a school decides to become grant maintained, I want the children to have the best possible education. I can say, ex cathedra, that it is also the policy of the Church to ensure that, even though against everybody's wishes—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend speaking on behalf of the Pope?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking—to use an earlier phrase—quasi on behalf of the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman speaking also on behalf of the Labour party? We should be interested to know whether the Labour party endorses his view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking absolutely on behalf of the Labour party, not just of the parliamentary Labour party, but of the Labour party in Wakefield metropolitan district, which I represent. If the Minister thinks that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
earned some brownie points because of that, will he ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, who produces the spending assessments for our district, to be a little more generous? <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister may say in public that there is fat chance of that, but I am sure that in private he will have a word with his right hon. and learned Friend. I shall not press that now, not just because it would be straying from the matter under discussion, but also because it might dissuade him from doing so.<br><br>
We need to know how the bodies will come together. It seems that a bureaucratic nightmare is being established. Either all the bodies work independently of each other and go their own sweet ways, or there is collaboration. There is a clear need for collaboration, but that should not be so bureaucratic as to impede the effectiveness of the bodies. Therefore, will the Minister consider carefully how the funding agency will work with the other agencies?<br><br>
Let me give the Minister a tip, which I always found helpful when undertaking simple tasks such as making a report on the direction in which St. Wilfrid's school was going: he should talk to the parents, as well as to the pupils. There should be regular contact with parents so that reports can reflect their feelings and perhaps force a change of direction. I know that the Minister can say that the governors will cover that, but he must not forget that a minority of governors are parents. I know that Tory Members who have been in the teaching profession will agree that it is not always true that parent governors are the best representatives of parents. Great care must be exercised when a minority of parents runs the lives of a majority of children, taking them in directions in which their parents do not want them to go. Therefore it is important that the funding agency should, for the purpose of its report, be told the feelings of the majority of parents—not the feelings conveyed by just two parents.<br><br>
Togetherness—a synthesis, one could say—is the theme of what Labour Members would like. I think that that applies to the Government too, and therefore I ask them to examine the method, manner and content of the reports and their relationship to others. Despite the clarity of English in the White Paper, the subject still needs to be clarified. We still need to define what is happening and how.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seem often to be called to speak immediately after my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, which puts me in a difficult position because he so lucidly explains Labour Members' point of view. We are not at all happy with the clause, as hon. Members will be aware, for a number of reasons, of which I will deal with one or two.<br><br>
We have reservations about the quality of the information that would be made available to the Secretary of State, the local education authorities or whomever. The Minister has made great play of the idea of information as power and of the great importance for parents of having such information. However, information is not just woefully inadequate but positively dangerous if it is not accurate and to the point. I am concerned that the Secretary of State should ensure that any information that he requests from the funding authority should be accurate.<br><br>
I reiterate the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford about SATs, their effect in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
last couple of years and the dangers of using some of the information that might be gleaned from them. I can only emphasise what he explained—that teachers who have had to deal with SATs, particularly teachers taking 7 and 8-year-olds through SATs in primary school—have had serious doubts about the merits of that form of assessment. They have said not only that it takes too long, but that they feel that the time used is wasted time in which they could have been doing something much more positive and educationally useful, and that the children have responded badly not only to the experience of the SATs but to the fact that the teacher is unable to give individual children as much attention as they need.<br><br>
I do not understand why we do not again look to Scotland for a better example. We hear constantly, and I have no reason to dispute it, that the Scottish education system is of a high standard and quality. I wonder why the system in Scotland, but not that in England and Wales, allows teachers choice about using SATs to support their assessment of pupils. Perhaps the Minister will take that point up and say whether we can ensure that the standards of which we feel so proud in Scotland could be transferred to England and Wales.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth spoke about quality assurance. We need quality assurance not only for what is being taught in schools, what local authorities are doing for them and what grant-maintained schools are doing, but for the information that is provided. That means ensuring that such information is properly and professionally gathered.<br><br>
The Minister and the Secretary of State have paraded as a success last week's league table debate, despite people throwing up their hands in horror at the mess that the Government have caused. That is a good example of the way in which bad information upsets parents, teachers and children. Incorrect information should not be passed from funding agency to Secretary of State or vice versa. Information that is made available should be accurate and of high quality. If the Minister insists on arguing that the league tables were a great success, he should visit schools for children with special educational needs in my constituency, which were not just horrified, but deeply upset because they were included in the league tables.<br><br>
Earlier, the Minister spoke about surplus places. I shall mention two examples from my own constituency. The Department for Education claimed that Lewisham had more than 4,000 surplus places. That was a substantial and avoidable error. The Department said that St. Theresa's school had 924 surplus places, yet St. Theresa's closed in July. The Department also claimed that Northbrook had a capacity for 1,693 pupils and more than 1,200 surplus places, when it has a capacity for 374 pupils and is overcrowded. Such inaccurate information is unacceptable. We must ensure quality assurance not only within schools but in the funding agency and in the information that the Secretary of State receives. Rather than simply being passed back and forth between the funding agency and the Secretary of State, quality information should be made available to parents, local education authorities and teachers.<br><br>
The funding agency's work should be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. The Government should assure us that the funding agency will not only provide proper information on SATs but take cognisance of teachers' views and act on them, changing the system if necessary, to enable pupils to get the best from their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
teachers, and parents to feel comfortable about the assessments carried out in local schools. None of that can be achieved without accurate, up-to-date information. So far, the information proudly paraded by the Government has been inaccurate, shot full of holes and downright dangerous. The Minister should assure us that the Secretary of State will ensure that professional people examine the information that he receives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the clause's central problems is that it does not tackle the relationship between local education authorities and the funding agency. The Government have not properly thought through what the relationship will be when more than 10 per cent. of the pupils in a given area attend grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
The problem is not simply about the flow of information from the funding agency and the Secretary of State, from the funding agency to the LEA and back to the funding agency and from the LEA to the Secretary of State. It is about who will take the lead in providing the information. The clause assumes that there will be a relationship between the funding agency and the LEAs, but it does not articulate how that relationship will develop or what it should be.<br><br>
It is all very well to state that there should be a flow of information, but if sufficient places are to be provided in a given LEA area efficiently and effectively, someone must be the boss and take the lead in determing what those places will be. It is not sufficient to state that there will be a relationship between the funding agency and the LEA. Someone must specify where the places will be. The Government should have thought in more detail about who would take the lead at different stages.<br><br>
For example, the Government could have said that, until 50 per cent. of children attend opted-out schools, the LEA will take the lead on the exchange of information in the relationship between the funding agency and the LEA. Once the 50 per cent. threshold had been passed, the lead would pass to the funding agency. Unless the Government think the matter through before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House, there will be real problems later.<br><br>
One of the problems with the provision of information is ensuring that it is accurate and fair. The league tables published last week were little short of a fiasco. The Government have a fixation with tables and that sort of information. Apart from being inaccurate, the information in the league tables is crude. Parents and educationists need not less, but more information. If the statistics in the league tables had been placed in a social context, the information would have been of more use to parents. Crude examination data are not a good indicator of what type of schools they are.<br><br>
As the parent of three children, I want to know what changes take place in the time between a child entering a school to it leaving. In the constituency next to mine there is an independent school that can select children, who come from fairly well-off backgrounds and whose parents can afford to pay fees. It is not sufficient to say that as the school has good examination results, it is a good school. One should consider schools that can change children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or who have special needs and create some success of them.<br><br>
When I worked in education, one of the greatest successes I had was when a child with whom I had worked intensively achieved one GCSE pass. That might not look very good in the Government's league tables, but in terms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
of the work put in by professionals and the achievement for that child, it was a magnificent success. The Government's view of education does not take account of such educational success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Congdon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I would not disagree that more information is useful, is the hon. Gentleman in favour of publishing unadjusted data in the form of actual results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of publishing information that is accurate, which is something that the Government are incapable of doing. Publishing raw data alone is misleading. People deserve the full facts. The Government could study various ways of providing such information. They already have statistics on, for example, indices of social deprivation across the United Kingdom and Z-factors by which they determine urban aid programming. The near natal mortality rate in the constituency next to mine—Rossendale and Darwen—is the highest in the country. There might be a link between underachieving and poverty, but, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would deny that.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is perhaps being unfair to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon). I thought that it was generally accepted among all educationists that there is a link between deprivation and educational performance. The concern of any education system and the Government is to try to ensure that schools working in areas where children are deprived are raised out of that deprivation into an education that can liberate them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and he is absolutely right. Anybody who has worked in education, which many Opposition members and some Conservative members have, knows that there is a clear link between social deprivation and academic performance, but obviously with exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's belief that all schools in deprived areas will under-achieve. Will he explain why some schools perform exceedingly well when they have children from deprived backgrounds compared with neighbouring schools with children from the same backgrounds that do not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should not respond to that intervention because we are going wide of the clause. No doubt we shall have another opportunity to return to the matter raised by the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Sir John.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all relieved. I represent a constituency that has high levels of social deprivation, and its county schools are not opting out—there is not one primary, secondary or special school that has applied for grant-maintained status. They are succeeding schools, succeeding in the midst of central Government cuts and a recession for which Conservative Members are broadly responsible. I do not, for one moment, suggest that all schools in deprived areas are failing schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the clause, which relates to the provision of information, will the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
Gentleman accept that the intervention of the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) is important? Her valid point is that information should be made available about comparisons of schools that are in similarly deprived areas, some of which have done well and some of which have not done quite so well. The concept of added value provided by schools, which the hon. Lady raised, is the very point that many Opposition members are saying is the important information that should be provided to parents. Raw scores of examination results, by themselves, fail to address the issue of added value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The Government have withheld information that would place the raw statistics in context. The figures will be distorted if taken out of context. As well as being inaccurate, the figures distorted the case. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) gave us the example of a school in her constituency which was full, but on record as having more surplus places than the total number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find this a bit rich. In Croydon 15 years ago, we published examination results and the same argument that other information should also be published came from the education establishment. I said to the local NUT branch, "Come up with other measures so we can measure value added." It has dismally failed to do so. It has woken up to the need to do it only because of the Government's decision to publish public examination results. Why did not the hon. Gentleman push the NUT to publish information in the past?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a pupil at St. Mary's Roman Catholic College, Blackburn, 15 years ago. If I had then been a Member of Parliament or a member of an education authority, I would not have demanded such information from the NUT. It should be demanded from the local education authorities. The better LEAs, such as Lancashire and that in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, have published statistics for a long time. We do not need lessons from the Government on providing information.<br><br>
The Government should be more specific in the clause, which is vague to the point of being meaningless. Will the Minister say who will organise the information? Suggesting that there will be a free flow means nothing. Someone will have to take a lead—will he give the direction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the sour and inaccurate comments of the hon. Members for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) and for Lewisham, East.<br><br>
To persist in characterising the information recently provided by the Department as grotesquely inaccurate takes a bit of believing. There are 250,000 lines of data with six proven errors. Unless Opposition Members can better prove their wildly exaggerated statements, they should stop making them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to have my say.<br><br>
Most of the few demonstrated errors were due to faulty input, not faulty output. It is regrettable that people cannot read and fill in forms properly. We shall all learn from the mistakes. The Opposition must substantiate their claim that the information is grotesquely inaccurate. I hope that the hon. Lady will substantiate it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder about the Government saying that there are six errors. I think that there were five yesterday. When our consideration of the Bill in Committee has come to an end, we may be closer to the correct number of errors in the league tables. Schools were shifted from one county to another, a school that does not exist was included and special "education" needs schools, which cannot compete with grant-maintained, selective or other schools, were included. I have stated repeatedly that last point to the Minister. How can he say that there is not inaccuracy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady is not saying that the information from the special schools is inaccurate. The special schools' representatives and organisations were consulted carefully before we defined this exercise. They said that they wanted to be included and treated normally. To do otherwise would be patronising and condescending. The hon. Lady is exemplifying such attitudes. If she wishes to put special schools in a little box and treat them as if they were inadequate, that is up to her. Conservative Members will not do that.<br><br>
We shall continue to treat people involved with special educational needs as people who are doing an excellent job. We shall continue to urge them and the children to participate and to improve, and not treat them as a special marginal case to be sidelined and possibly ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is appalling. Although one school in the Devon county council area did not ask for its results to be published, they were reported in the table. Another school has a row of noughts—for children who are severely physically and mentally handicapped. It is a triumph for some of those children to be alive, let alone to be passing examinations. The report has caused deep offence to the parents of those children. The report contained errors in respect of five out of the seven secondary schools in my constituency. One school was mentioned that does not even exist. The figures that were published were wholly inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will let my Department have details of the inaccuracies, we shall examine them in detail as we have examined all the others, and let him have the result of our investigations. Simply repeating assertions will not get us anywhere, nor is it good enough. If he would be kind enough to let us have the details, I undertake to have them looked into.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hemsworth expressed some anxiety about why the FAS might wish to change the character of a school. If the FAS considered that such a change was sensible, it would have to publish its proposals. They would be subject to the usual procedures for objection. The guiding principle in the context of providing sufficient school places is referred to in paragraph 3(1) of schedule 2. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the schools providing relevant education which are available for the area are not sufficient, the funding authority shall, for the purpose of securing the availability of sufficient schools providing such education for the area, exercise their powers to publish proposals for the establishment, alteration"—</p></blockquote>
which would include a change of character or significant enlargement—
<br><blockquote><p>"and discontinuance of schools."</p></blockquote>
I ask the hon. Gentleman not to consider such a proposal as a sinister move by the FAS. It would be part of the FAS process in fulfilling its obligation to provide both adequate and proper provision of places in a specific area.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) asked about the nature of the information required to be provided under clause 5. Most, but not all, of that information would be provided during phase two, between the trigger points of 10 per cent. and 75 per cent., when the LEAs and the FAS have the dual responsibility to ensure that sufficient, adequate and proper places were provided in each area.<br><br>
To do that, we envisage that both the LEAs and the FAS, in their different ways, would provide information such as actual and projected birth figures, the relationship between birth and actual attendances, the number of pupils attending independent or special schools, the level of migration in and out of the area, the number of pupils receiving education other than at school, the number of dwellings built in each area in the previous year, the projected future building figures and so on. Such figures would come from the local planning authority.<br><br>
I have cited only examples of the information that we envisage will be covered by clause 5. Such data would be necessary to enable the FAS, for example, fully and properly to discharge its duties when assessing how many places are required within its sector. It would rightly and properly be regarded as a requirement under that parallel regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the guidelines referred to in clause 5, which govern the dissemination of information between the parties mentioned, is it the Minister's intention that formal links should be established between the funding agency, or the funding council in Wales, and the local education authorities when between 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. of schools are grant-maintained, whereby officers of the two bodies could meet to discuss the information and plan sufficient school places?</span></p>
<p>7.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting thought. I am not sure that it would require guidelines. I hope that that will happen in the normal course of events. It will be in the interests of local education authorities and funding agencies to make the system work. The hon. Member for Hemsworth personally opposes the concept of grant-maintained schools, but I am sure that he will support the promotion of the best quality of education for grant-maintained schools. In that spirit, I expect local education authorities, the funding agency and the boards of governors of grant-maintained schools in each area to co-operate to ensure the best educational provision. In that sense, I believe that the process described by the hon. Gentleman will occur in the natural course of events. But, if it does not occur naturally, I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will use the powers available to him under clause 5 to make sure that it does. It is self evident, but worth putting on record, that it is in our interests to make sure that the system works as well as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that all hon. Members agree that, although some of us may not like the system that is being established, once it has been established, it is in the interests of the children, the parents and the community to make it work. I accept what the Minister said about expecting the information to flow, but, taking up a criticism of an earlier amendment, we must ensure that the legislation will work in all circumstances, especially in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
circumstances in which the spirit of co-operation between the funding council and the local education authority breaks down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, other than the 10 to 75 per cent. limit, a wide range of information may be required in other areas, for example, in special education. However, either side may say that it is not reasonable to ask for certain information. In the event of a request for information being considered unreasonable, who will arbitrate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that the Secretary of State would arbitrate in such a case. It will be in his interests to ensure that information is distributed so as to make the best possible educational provision. Any Secretary of State wants education to be of the highest standard. People may differ on how best to achieve that, but, once a regime is in place, it is in everyone's interests to make sure that it works properly, as, for example, it was in the interests of Conservative-controlled local education authorities to ensure that comprehensive education worked as well as possible.<br><br>
Clause 5 makes proper provision for the exchange of information between the key institutions involved in educational provision. I do not think that Opposition Members dissent from that. I hope that I have answered their questions and, in that spirit, I hope that the Committee will support clause 5.</span></p>

SUPERVISION OF FUNDING AUTHORITIES BY THE<br><br> SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 3, line 3, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The Secretary of State shall consult the funding authority before making an order under subsection (1) above, except where he believes it necessary to make an order urgently.'.</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief. I think that there will be little contention on this issue.<br><br>
The Minister said that the funding authorities should develop independent expertise. Therefore, it seems reasonable, that before the Secretary of State makes an order, he should consult the funding authority. I understand entirely that there will be exceptions—for example, emergency directions in relation to suspected misuse of public funds—but in the case of operational directions by the Secretary of State, it is entirely reasonable that the Secretary of State should want to consult the funding authority before orders are made.<br><br>
There are many examples of orders in the Bill. Clause 197 suggests that consideration will need to be given to the payment of grants to educational associations in the event of failing schools. It will be necessary to consider the priority of the distribution of the available resources between grant-maintained schools and education associations. I could use other examples, but, for the sake of brevity, I shall not.<br><br>
The funding of schools through the funding agencies, will replace their funding through local authorities. Today's announcement on the rate support grant was made following consultation by the Department of the Environment with the relevant organisations.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
Section 80(2) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before making the report, the Secretary of State shall notify"—</p></blockquote>
I stress that word, because there is a distinction between notification and consultation—
<br><blockquote><p>"to such representatives of local government as appear to him to be appropriate the general nature of the intended contents."</p></blockquote>
Within section 80(2), reference is made to the "notification" of various organisations before announcements are made, but I understand that it is common practice, following notification, to allow the various service working groups to make representations to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Funds are distributed through the rate support grant and that affects the money that the LEA subsequently distributes to schools. In that case, the concept of consultation before making an order is already built into the legislation. I am suggesting that a similar arrangement should apply to orders made by the Secretary of State in respect of funding authorities. Except in emergency cases, when orders are non-operational, I am suggesting that the Secretary of State should consult the funding authorities before making an order. I hope that the amendment is accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief point to make on the proposal that the Secretary of State should consult the funding authority before an order is made.<br><br>
Can the Minister confirm that, before an order is made, there will already have been informal consultation with the chairman of the relevant organisation? The funding agency is only one part of the school system; there are also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
local authorities. The supervision of the grant-maintained sector may have an impact on the local authority sector if the Secretary of State has to consult widely before making an order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hour and the stage of our deliberations, and in a spirit of exceptional good will, I accept the hon. Gentleman's argument. Given the reasonableness and the thrust of the amendment, I recommend it to the Committee. If the hon. Member for Bath withdraws the amendment, I will undertake to produce wording that reflects the spirit of the amendment but is more acceptable. His comments describe the relationship that I expect will exist between the Secretary of State and the funding agency for schools. The second part of the amendment is a sensible provision for the urgent cases that may arise.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be prepared to withdraw the amendment in the light of my specific undertaking to submit an amendment later which will give effect to the intention of this amendment but which will have been examined by parliamentary counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking desperately at the Government Whip. We understand that there may be a move to adjourn in the not too distant future. I accept the Minister's undertaking magnanimously. If I am too brief he might jump to his feet immediately. If not, we might be in some difficulty. I am getting no reaction from the Government Whip. I hope that he appreciates the speed with which I am responding positively to the Minister's suggestion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—<i>[Mr. MacKay.]</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at three minutes to Eight o'clock till Tuesday 1 December at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
