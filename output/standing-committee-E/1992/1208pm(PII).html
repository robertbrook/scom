	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martin. As you were not in the Chair before we adjourned for dinner, it might help if I start again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining my view that only a few permanent exclusions from schools are the result of a pupil's physical aggression towards teachers or other pupils. Many children are excluded for relatively minor breaches of school rules, so the punishment is out of proportion because it may well wreck their education and future careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave examples earlier of issues that are serious for schools, but not grounds for permanent exclusion unless they present a genuine threat to the education or welfare of other pupils or teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider minor breaches of uniform codes. From my work in an LEA and from reports, I know that hours are spent by psychologists and educational social workers and welfare officers persuading children who are poor attenders and who are disruptive in the classroom to go back to school. When the child returns, he or she may be sent home for wearing white socks, for example, or for another minor breach of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more worrying is the information supplied by the children's legal centre, which alleges that some schools may exclude troublesome pupils because they cost more and will bring down the school's position in published league tables. In one case, it is alleged that only under-achieving boys with long hair are excluded. Boys with long hair who in other ways are an asset to the school are not excluded. That is an extreme example but it shows why our anxiety about the problem is growing. It explains why schools need a tight legal framework within which to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the first part of the amendment is taken from schedule 2, paragraph 7 of the Children Act 1989, which states that local authorities must take
	<br><blockquote><p>"all reasonable steps to reduce the need for care proceedings".</p></blockquote>
We felt that the analogy was particularly pertinent to clause 8. It is not difficult to think of reasonable steps that schools could take to tackle the problem. Other than in isolated cases of extreme violence, the decision to exclude a pupil should not be taken quickly or lightly. In most cases, there is a cumulative process of disruption by a pupil. In the end—this is unforgivable—the school essentially loses its temper with the child and says, "Enough is enough. We are going to offload this problem."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, must say enough is enough. What the hon. Gentleman is saying is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
travesty of the truth about both local authorities and teachers. The report to which he referred mentioned 2,000 children being excluded, although not permanently. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that a child would, before being excluded, first be dealt with through the normal pastoral system, then by the headmaster. The case would then be referred to the governing body, which would have to refer it to the local education authority. I would have thought that that was the precise opposite of the fairly casual, flip way of dealing with disruptive pupils which the hon. Gentleman is imputing to local authorities and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly has not read the Government's discussion paper on exclusions, which refers to 3,000 pupils, not 2,000, all of whom have been permanently excluded. None is subject to fixed period or indefinite exclusions. Perhaps I could lend the hon. Gentleman my copy, if he would care to look at it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was making was that in most cases a school, in the face of cumulative disruption, unforgivably loses its institutional temper. The school should involve the parents early on when it is realised that there is a problem. It is difficult for parents to back schools up, which is what we all want, if they are not aware as early as possible that there is a problem. They need to know what the school is doing, so that they can back up that action in the home. Schools should, of course, involve the expert LEA support services that are on hand to deal with problems. All too often, that does not happen, because the school makes no decision, or even worse, the school applies to the support service but, because of cuts and financial restraints, there are too few support service staff to be able to help. I realise that support services vary from LEA to LEA but I would have thought that when disruptive pupils become increasingly problematic in the classroom, it would be common sense to get help from the school psychologist, who could work with the child and advise teachers on the prevention of disruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, schools also have access to education welfare officers and educational social workers. They have an invaluable and crucial role—although one that is sometimes overlooked—in providing a link between the child, the school, the family and other LEA support services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some LEAs, including my own, have other support agencies with a brief to keep children who have emotional and behavioural difficulties in the mainstream school. They do much intensive work with children and teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report published by HMI five years ago, entitled "Good Behaviour and Discipline in Schools" outlined the main factors that would underpin good practice. What was good five years ago is still good today. The report suggested that schools should have agreed policies on exclusions and discipline, which should be well known to staff, pupils and parents. Also, any sanctions should be applied consistently, avoiding an ad hoc approach by which children might sometimes be excluded for relatively minor offences. There should be a positive climate in the school, with challenges and responsibilities for all pupils. There should be a thought-out system of consistently applied sanctions and rewards for good behaviour. There should be proper support and in-service training for staff in dealing with classroom disruption. There should be close links with parents and the wider community. One of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
our fears about GM schools is that they will no longer be perceived to be as closely integrated with the community as LEA Schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be possible for the Government to include legislation similar to that in the Children Act, to specify in the Bill that a duty is placed on agencies dealing with children to work together closely and to operate in the best interests of the child. For example, the social services department will know about children who have been excluded. That department should be involved as early as possible in discussions aimed at keeping such children in a mainstream school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the second part of the amendment is similar to existing Scottish legislation on exclusions. It would ensure that permanent exclusions genuinely are the last resort and that they are imposed only when there is a serious threat to teaching staff and other pupils. They should not be imposed in response to petty breaches of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have expressed concern about exclusions, but the Bill deals with the problem only once it has occurred. Even the discussion paper, which I welcome and which the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) can examine later, talks about producing yet more league tables on exclusions. In the paper, the Government admit that that could pressurise parents into withdrawing children from schools instead of going through the formal exclusion process. The discussion paper also contains some rather vague ideas about financial incentives and disincentives for schools with regard to exclusions. I do not condemn those ideas out of hand: they are quite interesting, although fraught with technical difficulties, as the Minister will agree. For example, it would be difficult to make immediate the disincentive to exclude, given that a school has an annual budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion paper also suggests that the Department for Education might consider issuing guidance on exclusions criteria. However, such guidance could be ignored and would not be available to parents. If we are interested in involving parents seriously in the problem of exclusions, they must know exactly where they stand. Such knowledge must be placed in a tight legal framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains measures to deal with failing schools. One of the indicators of such a school is the number of exclusions that it makes. The DFE accepts that there are discrepancies between schools' rates of exclusion, even where schools have similar catchment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to what the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said earlier, I can assure the Committee that I do not intend to undermine teachers. They often have a difficult job trying to control disruptive pupils in class. However, the child's interests must remain our main concern. A child's emotional and behavioural difficulties should be recognised in the Bill. The Education Act 1981 has worked well in practice, but one of its failings was that its definition of a special educational need did not include emotional and behavioural difficulties. The Bill is similarly flawed. We should look for ways to help such children. It was lucky that you were not in the Room, Mr. Martin, when the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
suggested that pupils with learning difficulties and special educational needs should be caned rather than helped with their difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have you ever been to school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did you say that I had never been to school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not sound like you have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I worked for education support services before I became a Member of Parliament. I spent every working day of the past six years until April going into schools. I have been to more schools than the hon. Member for Wyre Forest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion paper makes clear the Secretary of State's view on exclusion. Paragraph 44(i) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exclusion should be seen as a last resort, and positive encouragement should be given to schools to secure high standards of behaviour and contain disciplinary problems wherever possible."</p></blockquote>
It is not enough to will that to happen. The Secretary of State seems to believe that it will happen because he wants it to happen. There should be a legal framework to ensure that it happens. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment in the Christmas spirit that he showed when we considered the previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) made an excellent speech and I do not wish to be too repetitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (No. 2) Act 1986 states that exclusion can be for a fixed period, an indefinite period or permanently. In recent years anecdotal evidence suggested that exclusions of pupils from schools had increased substantially. The press claimed that many LEAs had reported a significant increase in exclusions, especially during the past year. The National Union of Teachers carried out a survey of exclusions, which was published in May. It revealed that, in one year, temporary and permanent exclusions increased by 20 per cent. More than 5,300 pupils were excluded in only 26 LEAs. I suspect that those figures underestimate the true numbers, because some authorities did not include in their statistics the three types of exclusions that the 1986 Act defined. If those increased exclusions are reflected in other LEAs, 25,000 children could be excluded from schools every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's preliminary analysis, which was undertaken by the national exclusion reporting system, shows that 3,000 permanent exclusions were reported in one year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Out of the total school population?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest has had a good evening in the restaurant with a nice bottle of red wine. We are jealous of that. The hon. Gentleman knows that he will not have to make a speech. We have to stick to mineral water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure comprehensive consideration of every child's case before expulsion took place. It is significant that 12·5 per cent. of excluded pupils had statements of special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the NUT conducted a survey. Would he be kind enough to explain how the survey was undertaken? Was an independent survey group employed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
or did the NUT carry out the survey? How was the data acquired and how did the NUT collate it? Who did it employ, if anyone, to analyse the data?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has shown an interest and asked his question. The survey was carried out by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, an independent and respectable firm. I assume that the hon. Gentleman has heard of it and agrees that it is respected in its industry. The survey was put in professional hands and there was no bias.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell us what the terms of reference for Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte were? What were they asked to survey?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, that is not all that important. The National Union of Teachers employed Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte to carry out a survey of expulsions in 25 local education authorities. The findings are not meant to be political; they are an attempt to discover the problems, to come to conclusions and to find ways to solve the problems. There was no attempt to score political points, which is what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do. The survey was clearly an attempt to get to the root of the problem and solve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to discover how objective and impartial the survey was. Did Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte choose the 25 LEAs that it surveyed randomly or was it asked to survey 25 specific authorities? I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would explain those details to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot at the moment, but I promise to send the hon. Gentleman a copy of the report, which he can read in his leisure time. He could then give the Committee the information that he requested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the hon. Gentleman does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do not know, I admit that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that teacher's associations are careful to ensure that the results of inquiries such as the one that he mentioned are reliable? The NUT is attempting to bring about better teaching. If it were seeking better pay, it would be a different matter. Teaching associations are impartial when making such inquiries and their surveys are conducted in the same manner as the majority of reliable surveys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Everyone, except the mischievous and those attempting to undermine the report, would accept what my hon. Friend said. The report is an attempt to solve the expulsion problem. If Conservative Members do not want to seek solutions, fair enough. The NUT went about the survey impartially, employed a respectable firm to carry it out and came up with a set of statistics. I shall send the statistics to the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) so that he can read them for himself. I am sure that his mischievousness will go away and he will fully support the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put this matter in perspective before we become hysterical? The hon. Gentleman said that there are 3,000 permanent exclusions a year. No one has mentioned that the number of children in schools at present is 6 million. That means that one
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
pupil out of 2,000 is permanently excluded. That does not seem to me to be the willy-nilly exclusion of disruptive pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody is saying that. The national exclusion reporting system—a Government organisation—found that in one year there were 3,000 permanent exclusions. The figure that Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte arrived at is reasonable if we take account of both temporary and permanent exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Friend for Clwyd, North-West intervened, I had just said that 12·5 per cent. of those excluded had statements of special educational needs. That tells a story. Many of the children that were excluded and had statements of special educational needs found that the reason why they ended up with behavioural problems was that resources were not available to carry out particular statements. As an ex-teacher and as a parent, I remember that the children with special educational needs and learning difficulties were most disruptive if they were not carefully and properly catered for. Although I cannot be certain about that, I suggest that that is an important factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that he suspects that that explanation is appropriate when considering the data. Was that one of the conclusions of Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the conclusion of the hon. Member for City of Durham, who spent 21 years teaching in special schools. Although I am not an expert, I have some experience of that matter. Unlike Conservative Members, I am not dogmatic. I am prepared to listen to the arguments and base my solutions on the evidence that is presented to me. I only hope that the Minister is prepared to listen because, as far as I can make out, he has not listened to anybody. As a result, he has given us some disgraceful answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that a final analysis of the information obtained by the Government in their two-year monitoring of exclusions should be available by the end of this month. I have no doubt that the detailed findings will show that pressure on school resources has made it increasingly difficult for schools to respond to the needs of children with behavioural problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now have a dreadful admission to make to my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn and to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. After I became a head teacher in 1979, I used corporal punishment. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] I had taken over the post in a school in which corporal punishment was traditionally used. If a child was sent to me, I was expected to cane that child. I can honestly say that it hurt the child more than it hurt me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That experience led me to the following conclusions. I used corporal punishment for two years—from 1979 to 1981. One day I realised that the kids who were receiving that punishment were always the same ones. I was instructed by the local authority to put their names in the punishment book, to state the crime that they had committed, the number of strokes that had been given and name of a witness who was present when the punishment took place. I looked at the punishment book and read the records for two years. Over that period, five or six names appeared in the book time and time again. The same kids kept getting punished. It did not work and was a absolute waste of time. I stopped using it in 1981, sent back the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
punishment book to the local education authority and informed it that I should no longer use corporal punishment. The law then changed to make it illegal, but my point is that corporal punishment does not work. It became clear to me that over that two-year period that caning children does not solve problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With increased class sizes, teachers have less time to deal with individual needs and inadequate financing limits the schools' ability to make alternative provision. Local authorities are less able to provide sufficient assistance from educational psychologists to help children and to support particular schools. Additional demands on teachers' time limit the development of home school liaison provision. In that climate, exclusion of difficult pupils removes the problem and enables schools to push themselves up the spurious league tables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been easy for me to have gone to the chairman of the board of governors to ask to have a particular pupil excluded. I did not do that. Unfortunately, over the past 10 years, time has become of the essence and resources have become scarce. I suspect that many schools are now taking the easy way out. I am not being unprofessional by saying that; great demands are made on schools, and the easy way to deal with a difficult child is to get him or her out of the school. I believe that that is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools should not be punished for exclusions. The Government must consider providing incentives to encourage schools to keep excluding pupils. It is against the background of community schools, well resourced to provide high quality education for all children, that the number of exclusions will fall—not with a market system in which schools compete against each other to score points and climb up football-like league tables. Schools should be able to compensate for disadvantaged, counter discrimination and provide for children with learning difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be assumed that exclusions have increased because of poor LEA advice. The evidence from the Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte report is that schools continue to consider LEA advice to be helpful and useful. Three principal underlying reasons were given for the increase: first, lack of resources under local management of schools—accounting for 27 per cent.; secondly, consciousness of the impending introduction of comparative school performance league tables—27 per cent.; and, thirdly, deteriorating home circumstances and lack of parental discipline—18 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research conducted by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte showed evidence of substantially increased pressure on teachers and on their ability to respond to the behavioural needs of pupils. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within lessons, the amount of time for pastoral care, 'social time', and time spent talking to children had all decreased."</p></blockquote>
It is clear that independent in-depth national research should be commissioned by the Government into the underlying causes of the increase in pupil exclusions. That should satisfy Conservative Members. Meantime, amendment No. 184 would ensure that before a child is excluded, the needs of the child and of the school are considered fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall throw good light and sense on this issue, as I have on all others. The amendment would clarify the important issue of exclusion of pupils. It would ensure that "all reasonable steps" had been taken by the school and that all matters that are considered when pupils are excluded from school are given serious application. I do not think that unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members are no easy touch in this matter. We want and believe in good discipline in these schools because we send our children to them. I do not want my children's school to be badly ordered. Our criteria for excluding pupils are in line with good sense: repeated disruption by a pupil; irreconcilable breakdown in the relationship between pupil and school; the failure of parents to co-operate with the school; behaviour that is detrimental to the education of other pupils and that which is detrimental to their safety. Labour Members want good order in our schools.

The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth raised the issue of corporal punishment just before some members of the Committee went for a good dinner, while Labour Members sat here collecting their thoughts, ready for the next part of the debate. In a debate on 22 July 1986 on what was then the Education Bill, the hon. Gentleman moved an amendment to retain flogging in schools. He had assistance in the Division Lobby from some fairly honourable Conservative Members. Among the floggers were the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts), and the hon. Members for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) and for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson). The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth must have been deeply disappointed that he was not supported by the eminently sensible hon. Member for Berkshire, East (Mr. MacKay), who did not cast his vote. Even the then right hon. Member for Finchley, now Baroness Thatcher, did not vote for the amendment. I am sorry to say that the amendment was defeated—the ayes were 230, the noes 231—largely because of the lack of votes from those sitting on the Conservative Benches in this Committee.

This is an important issue. Exclusion of pupils must be carried out with care. It is proper for pupils to be excluded from school, either for a period of time or permanently, for the reasons that I gave.

I am worried that as schools are put under the microscope and more details are made public, they will have an incentive to dispose of disruptive pupils if that is possible. They will try to remove those children from their

rolls because badly behaving children generally have poor attendance rates and perform less well in external examinations. It is important to consider the present procedure. We have heard from my hon. Friends how exclusions take place: a case is considered by the school and then the matter goes to the governing body. Those exclusions often have the backing of the local authority.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In times of crisis, when a pupil is about to be excluded or has just been excluded temporarily from a school, the LEA may often bring in advisers, such as the educational psychologist. Liaison with the social services is often important in such cases. That can be an involved and protracted process. Sometimes, there will need to be contact with the local police when crime is involved, and we must not forget the excellent work of the educational welfare officers, who are almost always deeply involved in exclusion cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before an exclusion takes place, there is often careful negotiation with the LEA, which may act as a broker between schools and try to arrange the transfer of pupils from one school to another. Indeed, in some areas schools are willing to swap children to avoid recourse to permanent exclusion and to try and give a youngster a new start. The amendment would ensure that all those avenues are explored before a pupil is permanently excluded. The disruptive child could be subject to permanent exclusion or to some sort of LEA intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has spoken about exclusions, which I gather have recently increased. However, he also mentioned the involvement of the social services, the police and various other organisations. Does the hon. Gentleman consider that the involvement of those bodies has helped or hindered the exclusion problem? I ask that in all seriousness and am genuinely interested in the hon. Gentleman's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The involvement of other agencies often prevents a pupil from being excluded from school. The good work of the social services and the intervention of the police when a crime has been committed is helpful. However, the load of work in schools—the result of the introduction of the national curriculum and the other changes of the past few years—has placed enormous pressure on head teachers and other school staff and has reduced the time available for counselling and helping individual pupils. The increase in the number of exclusions is due in part to the fact that teachers have less time to handle the difficult cases that arise. However, I can tell the hon. Member for Norwich, North that exclusion is a last resort. I have attended the sessions of many governing bodies considering a permanent exclusion case. Usually, the discussion of the case ends with one of the lay members—often a person from business or industry—asking how the school was able to put up with such behaviour for so long. Many members of the Committee will belong to governing bodies and will have heard the same question being asked when the final decision has been taken to exclude a pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that there might be some incentive for a school to exclude a disruptive pupil permanently before all the other avenues have been explored. It is important to remember that disruptive and troublesome children also have rights. However, we must remember too that other children in the school have rights also, as do their parents, even if they are not enshrined in law.

	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
I am particularly concerned about the 75 per cent. threshold. Who will handle the placement—or replacement—of students who are permanently excluded from their schools when that point is reached, or before it is reached if the LEA has ceased to hold responsibility for running the education system in its area? Perhaps the Minister will answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will liaise with the social services, the educational welfare officer and the police? Who will do the rest of the work that is done at present? Will a hit squad come down from Darlington in a van to deal with these matters, or will the work be carried out on paper? Who will carry out the careful negotiating with the parents of a permanently excluded pupil? Such negotiations are often highly sensitive and emotionally charged. They are currently handled with care and sensitivity by education officers in town and county halls. Will that function be carried out by members of the funding agency? Will its staff negotiate with parents and with the services that I mentioned earlier? Most importantly, if the task remains the responsibility of an LEA—even before the 75 per cent. threshold is reached—will there be sufficient funds to deal with the management of this part of the process? The amendment deals with a minority, but an important minority, of pupils. As the hon. Member for Norwich, North said, it is increasing in number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited several schools that accept pupils with emotional behavioural difficulties. I am becoming alarmed because most such pupils are now subject only to permanent exclusions. There is no negotiation between the LEA, the parents and the school about placing the child temporarily in a school for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties with a view to returning him to the school from whence he came. Such pupils find themselves cut off from their schools and they never leave the EBD school. That seems to be increasingly common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about what the funding agency would do in such circumstances. Would it be able to negotiate with special schools of the type that I have mentioned? Could it carry out the sensitive work and monitor a pupil's progress with a view to placing him back in the original or in a new school? I hope that the Minister will deal with these important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exclusion, even if temporary, is not to be taken lightly. Permanent exclusion must be taken seriously. I am sure that governing bodies do that. As there are in the amendment, there should be enshrined in the Bill criteria stating the circumstances in which exclusions can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would stop grant-maintained schools excluding pupils permanently because they want to be rid of them. We are afraid that heads will take the view that it is easier not to have such children around because they would not be good for raw test scores. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said, there are three types of school exclusion: first, the fixed, cooling off period; secondly, an indefinite exclusion pending consultation; thirdly, a permanent exclusion. The amendment is concerned with permanent exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
Only the head teacher has the right to exclude a pupil but he or she must inform the governing body and the child's parents may appeal to that body against the exclusion. To judge from the Minister's earlier remarks, he is anxious about the issue and we welcome his concern. He recently published proposals for school exclusions which involve fining schools. I am against fining but in favour of extra resources for children who have special behavioural and emotional problems and who might otherwise be excluded because the school cannot cope with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By his pronouncements on the guidelines for school exclusions, the Minister has shown that he is aware of our anxieties about the clause. Therefore, I hope that we can persuade him to our point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When schools are under pressure to perform well for the league table, the head could be tempted permanently to exclude youngsters who are disruptive without trying properly to tackle the problems. The aim of the amendment is to avoid that. If a head takes that attitude, it is likely that the governing body will support him or her because such pupils could give the school a bad reputation, and the governors are conscious of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schools go out of their way to keep children who have behavioural and social problems. It is important that those schools are assured of funds to cope with emotionally disturbed children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was alarmed this evening by the comments of some Conservative Members and I shall read some brief extracts from the diary of a head teacher in my constituency. I do not have the experience in education of some of my hon. Friends but I thought it important that I understood the problems that face schools today. Therefore, I asked the head teacher to keep a detailed diary of her experiences over several days. I apologise in advance on behalf of the head teacher if the extracts are not grammatically accurate. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth will forgive her; at times she was writing under great stress and duress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The diary starts on a Friday. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The educational psychologist came in. I persuaded him to see a violent boy. Because he had limited time, this is preventing our real SEN children from being statemented. The boy is out of parental control."</p></blockquote>
The head teacher had to take a difficult decision, because of the school's limited resources, whether to go ahead with the statementing process for children with real learning difficulties or to concentrate resources on this one disruptive child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The diary continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His mother had to be informed and persuaded that the boy should start the statementing process, which is a very lengthy business. Another child who is in local authority care is deeply upset. She needs teacher/head teacher/assistant support."</p></blockquote>
Later that day, the entry states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Saw member of the LEA special needs team to 	<i>beg</i> for learning support assistance hours for another boy. He did have 25 hours of LSA in the infant school, but because of disruptive behaviour he has been temporarily excluded from the junior school. He has a statement but no clear hours stated."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the Government proposals to tighten up the statementing process. That should prevent a child being statemented without the school having the necessary resources to deal with him. LEAs and schools often find it difficult to meet those needs.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEA colleague, who had no resources to spare, tried to negotiate a solution for that child, which involved
	<br><blockquote><p>"putting him in a class with children who have been allocated learning support assistant hours."</p></blockquote>
That stretches precious resources. It may be unsuitable to put a child in a class to which he does not belong so that he can be with an assistant who should be allocated to another child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the following Tuesday, a boy, who she refer to as R, locked himself in a toilet. He is in foster care. He said that he may kill himself. The head teacher says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dad tried this in prison and social services told him this last night. I left an important secondary meeting and spent an hour with him. He should have someone with him all the time."</p></blockquote>
That child did not have someone with him all the time because of the scarity of resources in the school. Such a situation happens all too frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Friday of the same week the diary says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social services rang. They need information on a family they believe to be abusing their children."</p></blockquote>
She spent half an hour up-dating social services on this family.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is definite concern from the school. The children are very difficult and drugs are involved at home."</p></blockquote>
Later that day it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Kate came to a head. She now has no support assistance. Allocated since she was in care. Mum said she could return home."</p></blockquote>
The head teacher did not have time to keep the diary on the Thursday. On Friday she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yesterday I excluded a boy for 2 reasons—tried to strangle another child—clear marks left—pushing the same child into a teacher, who then fell against a wall."</p></blockquote>
That is a record of one school in my constituency, which is not a deprived area. It shows the stress that teachers, learning support assistants, children, parents and families are under. Schools are trying hard to retain some social cohesion and to do their best for their pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for excluded children should be enshrined in the legislation and not left to market forces, which the Minister is trying to promote by threatening to fine schools if they exclude too many pupils. Many schools would prefer to pay the fine rather than deal with the problem. On the other hand, we should try to protect schools that do their best for socially deprived children. They badly need extra resources to deal with the problem properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, schools will know that if they permanently exclude a child they will be sure to get rid of that pupil. The pupil might benefit from a fixed or indefinite exclusion; it would give him a second chance and it would give the school and social services the time to deal with some of the problems causing the disruptive behaviour. Under the Bill, schools will be tempted to exclude a pupil permanently too quickly. The youngster could be branded a trouble maker and a future criminal. That may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded the Minister to accept this important amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a particularly important amendment. I am saddened that it has caused such hilarity among Conservative Members. I have spent all my working life in education and this problem has always worried me; it has given me many sleepless nights. My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport was accused of arrogance, but I am not being arrogant by giving a
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
teacher's perspective. Teachers have a perspective that parents, administrators and politicians do not have. We need not apologise for providing the Committee with that perspective; that is representative democracy, and is incredibly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always suspected, and I have been proved right, that permanent exclusion for every child whom I taught meant the end of education for them until they were 16. I do not know of any child who has been permanently excluded and who has then gone on to succeed in other schools. I have taught hundreds—even thousands—of children, but have not achieved academic success with any child above the age of 14 or 15 who was sent to my school after having been excluded from a previous school. In the last three years of my teaching career before I came to this place, I was head of a large sixth form, with a roll of 170 to 180 pupils, only a small number of whom had been through the premanent exclusion process. That is why it is such a crucial issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The numbers may be only 2,000 or 3,000, but that represents 3,000 childhoods—3,000 children about to become adults without having had the benefit of the quality of education that we have the obligation to provide them with. Just as we are obliged to provide a high standard of education to children who are able, who conform and who join in the school system willingly, we are obliged also to do all in our power to prevent children from being deprived of the compulsory years of schooling between the ages of five and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exclusion causes teachers much heartache. Conservative Members may laugh, but that is true, not just of teachers who are members of the Labour party, but of those who support the Conservatives. Teachers and schools have a sense of failure. If it can possibly be avoided, schools and individual pupils should not carry round with them such a feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would simply put good practice into a legal framework. Many schools already act in that way. I hope that the school at which I taught and all the schools in my constituency follow such practice, but I am aware that in these times it is easy not to adopt good practice. Mention has been made of the factors in education, and in society generally, that have caused the increase in pupil exclusions over the past few years. Schools are in an extremely competitive position. Nobody can deny that the publication of league tables, whether or not one approves of that, caused incredible public interest. It is no good for us to say that we do not like them and that no one is interested in them; we all read them in our local newspapers, whether or not they were accurate. That must put pressure on schools to achieve the best results that they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members and I know that keeping on its rolls, badly behaved and unco-operative students who damage not only their own chances but those of their fellow students, does nothing to improve a school's place in the league table. In its first year as a grant-maintained school, Baverstock school in Birmingham—much vaunted by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest—excluded permanently 10 students, which was far in excess of any other secondary school in Birmingham. Its truancy rate went down because its exclusion rate was in the category described in the Minister's consultation paper as exceptionally high. I believe that that was not because many students suddenly began to behave badly until the teachers had refused or were unable to exercise control, but because Baverstock
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
had become grant maintained, and with all the pressure to do well from Conservative Members, it wanted to prove a point. It wanted to prove that grant-maintained schools in Birmingham could achieve better records than LEA—controlled schools. One of its first actions was to exclude 10 pupils in the first year, in an effort to do better in the league tables. Despite that, 20 schools in Birmingham achieved better results last summer than any grant-maintained school in the authority. Good results in Birmingham did not necessarily come from the grant-maintained sector.

Not only does Baverstock have the highest rate in Birmingham of permanent school exclusions, it also refuses to take students who have been excluded by any other school in the LEA. That is because of pressure to perform well in the league tables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, if not for giving in. Will she reflect on the point that a school such as Baverstock, or any other school that, because of the publication of league tables, is under pressure to perform well also has to consider the financial cost of making extra provision for difficult pupils? Is not that a further difficulty for schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Cost is important. One element of its importance—I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport on this—is that achievements can be made with potentially disruptive children only with close support from a staff member, a small group and an excellent teacher-pupil ratio. In present circumstances and with the desire to save money, those options are no longer available to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost factor links to another problem that is causing an increase in permanent exclusions—the increase in pressure on teachers and schools. Anyone who has taught will admit that at the end of some days, one knows that one has been harsher on children than one wanted to be or than one would be in other circumstances. I have finished teaching a lesson and wondered why I was harsh on a kid, what it was about that day that made me behave in I way I would not otherwise behave. Usually I found that it happened when pressure was on me to fill in forms, to send returns back, to teach bigger classes, to lose free time, to work again on a new set of national curriculum guidelines after thinking that I had got it all right the last time. That pressure of work and expectation—particularly larger classes and reduced resources—makes teachers behave in ways they normally would not. I admit that it has happened to me. I fear that such an atmosphere in schools is another cause of an increase in permanent exclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to that school, which the hon. Lady has mentioned in Committee, we should examine the figures. In 1988, 5 per cent. of pupils obtained A to C GCSE grades. By 1992, the figure had increased to 17 per cent. No exclusions occurred during that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Member for Wyre Forest quotes figures to protect Small Heath school when I did not introduce the school into the debate. The 10th Birmingham Labour Member did that. The hon. Gentleman talks about value-added. I understood that the publication of results did not take value-added into account. League tables contain only raw data. On that basis, Baverstock excludes 10 pupils a year and obtains better results than Small Heath, which excludes none and performs below the city average. By mentioning that, I do what the Minister and the Secretary of State for Education ask—I utilise the published information that is available to the public. I object to being accused of denigrating schools when I use information that the Government have made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an ex-teacher, I support the publication of all information about schools including the number of exclusions.

Complications arose when league tables were published. They will also arise when exclusion rates are published. The chief education officer for Warwickshire—the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth represents part of that county—was interviewed in the Sunday press. She speculated that, if tables for permanent exclusions were published, some parents might select a school with a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
high exclusion rate because they believed that it was tough on indiscipline. One can understand parents who favour a school with few exclusions because they believe that there is no trouble in that school, but the opposite could be true. We constantly face such dilemmas when we publish information. However, I support the wish of the hon. Member for Norwich, North to publish as much information as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the introduction of the national curriculum, I learnt about another form of temporary exclusion that especially saddened me. Some Muslim girl students do not take part in dance classes, which are part of the national curriculum, because of the clothing that the school feels it is appropriate that they should wear. Their parents decide not to send them to school on the day in which there is a dance class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating permanent exclusions, but temporary, time-defined and permanent exclusions all cause great concern. If members of the Committee have not yet been persuaded that the issue is important, they should consider who is being excluded. Much reference has been made to the exclusion of children with special needs. However, two other groups appear in greater number than they should do in the tables of permanent exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first group is the Afro-Caribbean community in which the ratio in the tables is 4:1. Pupils from that background are far more evident in permanent exclusions than their percentage in the community would suggest. The other group is boys of 14, 15 or 16. They are far more likely to be excluded than girls of a similar age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start from the premise that there is nothing about special needs children, Afro-Caribbean children or boys that makes them more likely candidates for permanent exclusion. Therefore, when I see that those groups figure highly in the permanent exclusion league tables, I become worried. I wonder what circumstances have caused that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the report on exclusions, which the DFE published last Tuesday. It recognised the seriousness of the issue. If, as a nation, we care about the education of all children, it is time that we deal with the problem of permanent exclusion. I hope that part of the DFE report was based on the excellent Elton report that was issued two or three years ago. It discussed discipline in schools and considered strategies that may be adopted to overcome discipline problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortuitously, the Bill ties in with an issue of current importance. Because of too few resources, classes that are too big and the emphasis on market forces, the problem of permanent exclusion has never been so important. We have an opportunity, through the Bill, to put exclusion into a legal framework that will protect children who may find themselves permanently excluded when they should not be. If we were not considering the Bill, there would soon be a call from all those involved in education for legislation that would provide such a legal framework. With the Bill, we have an opportunity to do that before we are called upon to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are times when children should be permanently excluded. I support the amendment to clause 8 (6). As soon as a child's behaviour affects the learning of any other child in a classroom or the well being of any member of staff—teaching or non-teaching—it is time for the school to act. It must say, "We cannot do any more. We have an obligation to those who come here to teach and to learn. Although it is sad and we feel it to be a failure, we must pass on responsibility for the child's
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
education to a body outside the school." Nobody can underestimate the severity of that step and the impact that it will have on the life of that child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, most children who are permanently excluded face other problems, too. For example, they may be sexually abused, come from homes that are poverty ridden, or go home at night and listen to their parents arguing. Those children take on responsibilities in their family that far exceed any that I have been asked to take on for other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth talks about the deterrent effect of a cane in the head teacher's classroom. If the home life of those children is not a deterrent, I am pretty sure that a cane in the corner of the head teacher's classroom will not be one. For most children who are permanently excluded, a caning is nothing compared with what they go home to and put up with, night after night, weekend after weekend. That is why many of them cannot cope at school. That is a growing problem in education and one that is cause for anguish. It is vital that children are not permanently excluded unless we can do nothing else with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment simply says that no pupil should be excluded unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"all reasonable steps have been taken by the school to avoid excluding the pupil".</p></blockquote>
That is an adequate, caring and firm framework against which head teachers, chairs of governors or local education authorities should measure their actions when dealing with a child whom they are about to exclude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, I remind the Committee that there is due to be a Division in the House at 10 o'clock.

My approach to the debate is not quite the same as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn. In a previous incarnation, I worked in a multi-disciplinary assessment team, with an educational psychologist, a social worker and a co-ordinator, to try and keep in school pupils who were in danger of being kicked out. We also tried to ensure that they were allowed to stay at home, because they were in danger of being kicked out from there. The local authority probably introduced that initiative for purely financial reasons. Changes in legislation which stopped the pooling of the costs for special education meant that each local authority had to find the money for its special schools out of its budget. LEAs up and down the country looked for good practice to ensure that pupils stayed in ordinary schools, as that was better financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past seven years, my mission was to try to keep a large number of pupils in school. If there had been a provision on the statute book that was similar to the amendment, my life would have been much easier. It also would have been much easier in school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I examined the way in which we dealt with disruption. I raise this point in a paradoxical way, because I believe that what I am about to say will cause disruption on the Conservative Benches. One cause of disruption at school is boredom. For most of the day, the Lobby fodder on the Conservative Benches has been doing correspondence and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
signing Christmas cards. Since coming back from dinner, they have had nothing else to do but barrack my hon. Friends—[HON. MEMBERS: "Shame!"]. I thought, given what I have just said, that they would not react, but I was wrong. Then again, public schools are often less able to deal with such behaviour, in a paradoxical way, and that is probably what Conservative Members are used to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Government's statistics, 3,000 pupils have been permanently excluded from school. It does not matter what percentage of the school population is represented by that figure—for every pupil, exclusion is an educational opportunity lost. As my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley said, once pupils have been permanently excluded, it is difficult to get them back into school and on course for an education or career from which they will benefit. If the amendment prevented half of those pupils from being permanently excluded, that would be a reason for the Government to accept it and take credit for the benefits that would stem from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of 3,000 is only the tip of the iceberg. For every pupil who is permanently excluded, a range of pupils is in trouble at school and in continual danger of permanent exclusion. The amendment would deal with that problem. It states that the LEA or funding authority must first satisfy itself that no pupil is permanently excluded unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"all reasonable steps have been taken by the school to avoid"</p></blockquote>
exclusion. Therefore, I believe that each school should have an overt, codified pastoral care system that deals with the way that disruptive pupils are handled in school. It could even be termed the pupils charter because it would explain their rights, within the system, in avoiding exclusion from school. In that way, the LEAs could demonstrate that they had fulfilled this part of our proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that this is a good amendment. I am sure that the Minister, who has been so generous this afternoon, is convinced by our argument and that in his winding-up speech, after the Division in the House, he will accept the logic of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not be offended if I say that the pressure currently building up in our schools—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you have resumed the Chair, Sir John, but I shall not give you the details of what I said before, as there was not very much of it. There was a little contretemps earlier about the number of interventions, so I tried an old schoolteacher trick called the paradox: one tells a person how he or she will behave to ensure that, paradoxically, that person will behave in the opposite manner. That works with intelligent pupils, but it failed in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing amendment No. 184, which would introduce into clause 8 the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate authority having first satisfied itself that no pupil has been permanently excluded unless
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) all reasonable steps have been taken by the school to avoid excluding the pupil".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
I shall speak about the second part of the amendment later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools have difficulty with pupils whom they may exclude permanently because of the pressure exerted by all the education legislation of the past 13 years. Schools are now obliged to publish performance information. I have no difficulty with the publication of relevant information, but it now appears that the Government may be considering requiring schools to publish attendance records and exclusion figures. They may also be considering publishing punctuality marks, which might be appropriate in this Committe. As some of my hon. Friends have said, the danger of such information is that it may cause schools to believe that they can best prove enhanced performance by permanently excluding disruptive pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, poor school attendance figures are statistically interesting but they give no clue as to why some pupils are poor attenders. Some schools may consider that that stark figure is drawing down their performance and that they should resort to permanent exclusion. An additional difficulty is that poor attendance can be related to poor academic performance as a result of missed coursework. The risk is that pupils will be permanently excluded not only because of their poor attendance records but because their poor performance in public examinations—if they were allowed to sit them—would bring down their school's rating in the league tables. The amendment would go some way towards mitigating such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of the disruptive pupil, about whom I shall say more later. However, the performance of a disruptive pupil is sometimes cited as a reason for permanent exclusion because of the perception that that student will drag down the performance of the rest of the school. We must deal with that pupil's disruptive behaviour and performance. No Opposition Member will say that disruption should be ignored. Far from it: we believe that disruption in schools should be tackled, but that that is best done in the pupil's own school. Exclusion should be the last resort. Schools should be encouraged to deal with disruption themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the category of the undesirable pupil. Sometimes, schools consider—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an anecdotal aside, I often consider behaviour in terms of how it can be modified. One way to deal with difficult pupils is by a behaviour modification programme. My family had some personal grief last week.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
My dog, Guy, who was 14 years old, was put down on Friday morning. We bought a new puppy who is going through a modification programme now. I have a great interest in animal welfare. The hon. Member for Battersea is anxious about mink farming; I hope that we share a view that that barbaric practice should be condemned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools sometimes take decisions about the desirability of keeping certain pupils. They may be encouraged by the current climate in education to opt for the permanent exclusion of such pupils. The amendment deals with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national curriculum can be a barrier to effective school attendance. A curriculum prescribed by Government may not meet the needs of individual pupils who may therefore not attend school. That problem was envisaged in the 1930s when the Secondary Schools Examination Council consultative committee on education made the following observation in the Spens report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a cardinal principle that the examination should follow the curriculum and not determine it".</p></blockquote>
We now have an examination-dominated curriculum, which may not be relevant to the needs of some school pupils. The national curriculum could be seen as a barrier to continued attendance at school. When pupils do not attend a school, it has an incentive quickly to exclude them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other changes may have contributed to the increasing number of permanent exclusions. The GCSE was a Conservative innovation that I supported; it was a good move to merge the GCE and the CSE into a common qualification for 16-year-olds. I support, too, the introduction of course work as a means of determining a pupil's ability. That is far better than asking children to take a memory test on one day, rather than proving what they can do during the year. However, 100 per cent. course work has a drawback: if a pupil, for whatever reason, is out of school on a fixed-term or an indefinite exclusion, or because of illness, moving house and so on, he will miss part of the curriculum. In year 9 and later, participation in the subjects that children have chosen for GCSE is essential. We must ensure that there is a mechanism for pupils not in school to follow the national curriculum so that their results do not cause the school to under-achieve and therefore reduce its average score. If we did that, a school would not be forced to say, "We are awfully sorry, but permanent exclusion has got to be an issue in this case."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem about permanent exclusions is that schools have lost their tolerance of the behaviour of certain pupils. Teachers have had a lot of work to do during the past 13 years, especially since the Education Reform Act 1988 was passed. Teachers' school days have been lengthened, their holidays have been reduced and they have to put in more and more work to organise the national curriculum standard attainment test. The amendment would help to deal with that by making permanent exclusions the ultimate remedy for disruptive pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a strategy on fixed-term and indefinite exclusions. Despite being excluded in such ways, a pupil could be allowed back to his school, but all too often fixed-term and indefinite exclusions are the route towards permanent exclusion. We must make sure that that is not the case. A short-term suspension of a pupil must be aimed
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
at allowing the pupil to return to school as soon as possible to ensure that he can fully participate and gain educational benefit from the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would put in place safeguards for excluded children. Schools would know that there will be at times one or two exceptional pupils who cannot be managed. There would have to be a permanent exclusion of such pupils, and the amendment recognises that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is all really rather odd. I can best characterise the oddity by referring to the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As some Labour Members have kindly said, my Department is consulting on this important issue even as we speak. I am grateful that Labour Members support consultation about such a difficult issue. We have posed questions in the consultation document to enable consultation. Would not it be odd if the Committee accepted the amendment when we are in the early stages of consultation? Strictures were placed on me at the start of Committee proceedings—it seems like 100 years ago, but was only a few weeks ago. Labour Members were critical and said that the consultation period was too short, yet they are now trying to pre-empt the consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has completely misjudged the Opposition's case for the amendment.

I cannot prejudge whether this or any other amendment will be appropriate until the consultation has finished. Having listened to a lot of nonsense about consultation from Labour Members, it is obvious that they do not understand the process. We are posing important questions and hope to get positive, coherent answers, which we will analyse. If we judge that returning to the Committee with proposals for the Bill is justified, I would expect to do so. However, I shall not prejudge responses to the consultations. I am shocked that Labour Members seem so willing to prejudge and to present forms of words before we know the answers to the important questions that have been posed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should never believe what he reads in newspapers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being mischievous. The amendment is a minor measure that is needed to supply a basic provision in the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has half a point. The clause deals with the narrow aspect of the directions that may be required at some time during the exclusion process. This is not the part of the Bill in which to cover exclusions in general.

The deadline for replies is late January and I should expect to be giving them urgent consideration by February. I might have to think again if, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, the Bill will have completed its passage through the other place by February. However, that is unlikely, given that after about 50 hours in Committee we are still on clause 8. The hon. Gentleman is being slightly optimistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister, but does not he agree that permanent exclusion should be the last resort for schools and that the funding authority or the LEA should make absolutely certain that that is the case? That is what the amendment would call for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an easy statement to make and the document states that one point, if not at more than one point. If we concluded that exclusion should be a last resort, that begs many intermediate questions about the role of exclusions and other disciplinary procedures that may be available to heads of schools. Even if we came to that conclusion, I am not convinced that the amendment would be the right way to implement it or that this is the correct place in the Bill to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is wrong for many reasons: it is probably the wrong place in the Bill to include it and it might pre-empt my consultation procedure, which I should be reluctant to do. If Opposition Members take seriously their words about consultation, I urge them to withdraw the amendment and to wait with me for the results of the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister answer my question? If the funding agency is responsible for providing education in an area—either before or after the 75 per cent. threshold has been reached—will it have responsibility for placing children in schools? If that is the case, will it carry out the type of consultation to which I referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even after the 75 per cent. threshold is reached, LEAs will continue to exercise school attendance functions and education welfare services will continue to operate in respect of individual children.

	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My second point was: is the Minister confident that, after the 75 per cent. threshold has been reached, LEAs will have sufficient funds to carry out those duties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.

So for all the reasons that I have given, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment. I hope that I have persuaded Opposition Members to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start by saying, perhaps to the surprise of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, that I agree with something that he said. He said that excluded pupils were those most in need of education. That is the only thing that he has said in all our debates with which I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the intervention of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, who seemed to support Labour party policy on value-added information. We know that the Minister has banned Conservative members of the Committee from making speeches, but if interventions continue to support our policy he may ban them as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speeches from Opposition Members have been excellent. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said that the problem of exclusion had to be placed in the context of declining resources. That is true. Many schools are trying to cope with children, especially from the primary sector, with behavioural and emotional difficulties, but the wait for a psychological appointment may be long. In my constituency, I know of examples in which the referral of a primary school child may take up to a year because not enough psychologists are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge pointed out that best practice already exists. As we suggest, every effort is made to keep the child in school and every avenue is explored before permanent exclusion is decided upon. That practice already occurs in the best schools. However, a child's school career is too important to leave the adoption of best practice by schools to chance. A legislative framework is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was deeply disappointed by the Minister's remarks on the consultation process. I am struggling to maintain parliamentary decorum, but duplicitous is the best word that I can think of to describe them. The Government have a preconceived view about exclusions as they enter the consultation process. We already know from page 8, paragraph 44(i) of the discussion document on exclusions that the Secretary of State's view is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exclusion should be seen as a last resort".</p></blockquote>
That is all that the amendment says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation involves the procedures relating to exclusions rather than to the exclusions themselves. It assumes that exclusions will be the last resort. The questions that appear in sections 9 and 10 of annexe A of the discussion document ask for advice and views on how to discourage schools from excluding pupils and how to encourage schools to
	<br><blockquote><p>"contain serious breaches of discipline"</p></blockquote>
within the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's arguments are crystal clear. The number of exclusions is rising, which is a cause of concern to the Government as well as to Opposition Members. That is why the Government issued the discussion paper and why a couple of years ago they set up the NERS. The Government agree with the amendment.

We know that the number of children with special educational needs who are being excluded is disproportionately high. The Government agree about that too. We are saying simply that all reasonable action should be taken before a child is permanently excluded and we know that the Secretary of State agrees with us about that too. I am astounded that the Minister feels unable to support the amendment. I am at a loss to know why that is so. I appeal to Conservative Members to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 4, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) In any case where a child has been premanently excluded from each school which is a reasonable distance from his home and provides suitable education, a direction under this section may specify any such school.'.</p></blockquote>
I am tempted to use a phrase used by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, who said that he was making, not a party point, but a serious point. The amendment has indeed a serious point to it I assure the Minister that he would not, in accepting it, prejudice the consultation that he rightly wants on the document about exclusions that he has circulated. Whatever the Minister's views about the claim made by the hon. Member for Hyndburn that a previous amendment did not prejudice consultation on the document, I am sure that he will agree that my amendment in no way affects it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is so simple that it will, I am sure, be accepted by all members of the Committee, who no doubt agree that we wish children who have been excluded from school to be back in school, receiving an appropriate education, as rapidly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 does not provide for an order to cover a child who is excluded from all local schools in the vicinity. The amendment would provide for an order to place a child in a school from which he or she has been excluded. The provision would be used only as a last resort. Two secondary schools might serve an entire rural area. The odd pupil will have been excluded from both. Where will that pupil go? There are two options in the measure. The Bill provides for the child to be educated outside the school. Paragraph 42 on page 8 of the consultation document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such provision can be expensive to establish and maintain properly in the face of a fluctuating clientele. Reports to the Department suggest that a large number of excluded pupils are receiving education which is inadequate".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
By the standards of the Minister's document, that option does not give the pupil the best educational opportunities. The second option is allocating the pupil a place that is not in the local area. That means a long way from the pupil's home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide a third option. It includes the word "may" rather than "will". The pupil might, therefore, be allocated a place in a local school from which he had been excluded. It is a simple amendment. Acceptance of it does not require Christmas spirit. Simple logic shows that if the amendment is not accepted, the Committee condemns pupils who are excluded from schools in an area to inadequate education or to travel a long way. The Committee does not wish to do that. I am sure that logic and sense will prevail and that the amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Gentleman's logic. However, I am reluctant to commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman forces me to say it up front, yes, it means no. I am sure that he would like me to explain briefly the reasons for that, unless he is prepared to leave it at "no". I expect that my colleagues wish to hear an explanation. In this Committee, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are indistinguishable. I can address the Opposition as one. That would reflect the voting pattern and their mutual support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that I am at one with the Labour party in opposing this pernicious Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That gives us a complete set. I am happy to acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement. I shall remember it in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is inappropriate for two reasons. First, there are well-established means of redress and appeal in the process leading up to exclusion. That process will remain unchanged and will continue to provide some reassurance in what is always a distressing circumstance. However, I concede that exclusions may have to be imposed as a last resort in special cases. As has been acknowledged, local education authorities are empowered to provide education other than in school for children who have to be excluded. The amendment could be interpreted as undermining the power of exclusion that is available to head teachers as a necessary last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is not an overstatement to say that the amendment could make a nonsense of the exclusion option. Whatever hon. Members think about exclusion—whether or not it is a last resort—we must accept that it is important to retain exclusion as the ultimate weapon in a head teacher's armoury. Head teachers have a difficult job dealing with some pupils. My fear is that the amendment could undermine that work. Until the consultation process has given us a better feel for what people involved in education—head teachers, teachers, LEAs and—other bodies—think about the problem, I cannot recommend that the Committee accept an amendment that may do irreparable damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will consider withdrawing the amendment. If he does not, I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly heartened by the Minister's comments. I did not expect him to accept the amendment,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
but at least he said that he could not accept it "at this stage", to use his words. He also said that it is important to wait for the results of the consultation process. I do not see how that process will help the Minister, but he believes that it will. That consultation period will end on 29 January and the Minister has assured the Committee that he will review the results rapidly. Therefore, there may be an opportunity to raise the matter again before the Bill completes its passage through both Houses. As a result, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, the Minister promised to look at the matter again, and we hope that there will be an opportunity later in the Bill's progress through the House to debate the matter again. Therefore, we shall not press clause 8 to a Division in the hope that the Minister will consider this important matter again in the serious mood of his earlier contributions to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DIRECTION TO ADMIT CHILD TO SPECIFIED SCHOOL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 5, line 4 after 'body', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and head teacher and staff.</p></blockquote>
The aim of recent legislation has been to encourage parental choice. So a direction should be the exception. Therefore, when a direction is proposed, it is crucial that full information is available to all parties and that the widest consultation takes place. It is inappopriate to exclude from the consultation process the head teacher and the teaching staff. Those professionals form a partnership with parents to provide the most effective education for pupils in their care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would strengthen the Bill by including those parties in their own right and not just through the governing body. That they have been excluded must be a drafting mistake. I cannot believe that the head teacher and teaching staff were not to be included in the consultation exercise. Parents have rights, but for goodness sake the teaching staff have the right to be involved in consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governing body may be responsible for the school in the long run, but teachers are at the sharp end: they are at the chalkface. The Minister may tell us later that the Bill provides for consultation with the head teacher and staff through the governing body. The Minister is already nodding in agreement, but that is not good enough. Many years ago I was a member of, and chaired, several governing bodies. My experience is that the relationships between governing bodies and head teachers differ. Some governing bodies consult fully with the head teacher,
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
others do not. Some governing bodies take direction from the head teacher, some do not. Some governing bodies instruct the head teacher, some do not. Therefore, it is not good enough to depend on the good will of the governors to consult. The Bill should make it clear that the head and the staff must be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed findings of the Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte survey show that pressure on resources has made it increasingly difficult for schools to respond to the needs of children with behavioural problems. LEAs do not analyse the underlying causes of the increase in pupil exclusions. However, the survey reported the views of teachers at the sharp end. One reason given for that increase was that the increased pressures on schools because of the introduction of the national curriculum, testing and assessments have left fewer or no staff to deal with pupil problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of alternative provision was another reason given. There was found to be a lack of educational pyschologist support, especially for pupils with behavioural problems, and a reduced home tuition provision. The survey found that the integration of special needs pupils in mainstream schools has not been accompanied by sufficient funding. The small amount of money available is insufficient to persuade schools to hold on to those pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social pressures on schools, as well as educational pressures, have increased alarmingly. That is recognised in the White Paper, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A good school is a bulwark against those pressures which undermine individual and community values."</p></blockquote>
There is a lot of truth in that observation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers regard it as part of their professional role to assist pupils facing difficulties, of whatever kind, outside the school so that they like their peers, can make full use of the learning opportunities provided. There are pressures on pupils and therefore on schools from the growing number of unstable families and from increased crime, violence and drug abuse. Unemployment and dislocation caused by the recession add to the difficulties that teachers face in their classrooms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the receiving school to which the child is directed. The amendment states
	<br><blockquote><p>"head teacher and staff".</p></blockquote>
Presumably that means teaching staff. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why all staff should be consulted, and how that would be done? The head and staff representatives will be on the governing body; I cannot therefore conceive of circumstances in which a school whose governing body is consulted would not take into account the views of the head and, through their representatives, the staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always glad to give way to the hon. Gentleman, who takes a keen interest in these matters. However, he obviously was not listening to what I said. Governing bodies have different attitudes; some listen to the head and the staff representatives and some do not. The Bill does not state that this consultation should take place; there is thus a distinct possibility that in some schools there will be no such consultation. If it is important that the head and the staff are consulted, it must be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governing body of my school was extremely good; it consulted me on every issue that came before it. We had meetings with the staff representatives before and after the governors meetings to discuss the decisions taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
However, I was also a member of a governing body whose chairman was harsh, to say the least, on the views of the head and the staff and such cases worry me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying. My point is that the decision will not be taken by the governing body which may, or may not, take any notice of the head. The decision will be taken by the authority which wants to place the child. That authority will consult the school and the parents. Therefore, I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety. The LEA that places the child will seek the views of the entire governing body, which includes the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not repeat my answer. Such consultation will not take place in some schools. The LEA may hoist the child on to the school without consultation. That is why we tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. gentleman does not appear to find any comfort in what my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said. He does not feel that the head teacher and the staff on the governing body would be listened to. I presume that the hon. Gentleman meant all members of staff as he did not qualify what he said. How would their opinion be decided, unless it was decided by the staff representatives or by the head, whom he is worried will be ignored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. If the staff and the head are consulted directly, it will be clear what their views are. If they are not consulted directly, their views will not be clear to the governing body and the LEA that are undertaking the consultation exercise. A direct approach to the staff will elicit the school's view, not necessarily that of the governing body. I must push on as I have had a note from my hon. Friends on the Front Bench telling me that they want to make progress. So do I. The Bill and its White Paper will not open up a serious dialogue with the teaching profession. They do not discuss the profession's role in any scheme to improve the quality of education. Teachers recognise that their job is becoming increasingly demanding. Research studies over the past five years undertaken by bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive, have highlighted teacher's traumatic working conditions and have identified such conditions as a major cause of occupational stress. There is no commitment in the Bill to enhancing the teacher's role or to working with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School's ability to cope with support staff, teacher cover, training and certain class sizes could be related to teaching pupils with behavioural problems by consulting with teachers. Teachers have to teach children, so they have a right for their opinions and professional judgments to be heard—to the benefit of teachers and, most importantly, children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded by what the hon. Member for City of Durham said, partly due to what emerged from the close and incisive questioning of my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea and for Wyre Forest. There is imprecision in the amendment that could make it volatile. In a large school with a large staff it would be difficult to follow the spirit or the letter of the amendment. That is a serious flaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subversion or circumvention of the governing body's role is also potentially serious. The governing body is responsible in law for admissions. We do not wish to divorce governing bodies from that responsibility—they
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
will continue to carry it. I would need to be much more persuaded before I brought about such a divorce. It is also difficult to imagine how the amendment would work in practice. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was not convinced by my argument. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument. He said that it would not be possible to consult in a large school. That is nonsense. No one would want to consult with every teacher in such a school. The teachers of any children under discussion would be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A difficulty arises in that the amendment says not "appropriate staff" or "relevant staff", but simply "staff", which could be interpreted to mean all staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of our amendment and introduce an amendment that specifies "appropriate staff" or "relevant staff", I should be happy not to press the amendment in favour of his one. He does not seem interested in doing that, so my argument wins the day. He is not prepared to bring forward the solution to what he considers to be our flawed amendment. However, after consulting my hon. Friends, or, having been consulted, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 5, line 23, after 'may', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'within the period of fifteen days beginning with the day on which the reference was made'.</p></blockquote>
Much of the ground of the amendment has been covered already, but I want to emphasise one or two matters. It is important to recognise that the exclusion of a child from a school is often the end of a long process of suspensions that has already kept him or her out of education. With his customary charming naivety, the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said that only 3,000 out of 6 million children were excluded. That begs the question because the 3,000 children are concentrated mainly in a specific age group and come from particular areas, which makes exclusions in those locations severe. There is a cluster of permanent exclusions and it would be wrong not to put those children back into education as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to the point made admirably by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth—who must be getting very worried—that those are precisely the children who need eduation. It is easy for schools with difficult problems to keep out a child for the good of others—mea culpa on occasions—and to forget about the good of that one pupil. It is crucial that decisions are taken as quickly as possible and that the individual pupil is given alternative education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like everyone with difficult decisions to make, the Secretary of State is likely to put off the evil day. The amendment would put the same constraints on the Secretary of State as are on governing bodies and everyone else. That is perfectly reasonable. If the Minister wishes to consider it further, as he is doing with other matters, we should be delighted to accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can see what the hon. Gentleman wants to do through the amendment. It is tempting to tie the hands of the Secretary of State and impose a deadline, but I must warn the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that we are talking about cases that are, by definition, the most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
complicated and contentious, and that will go to the Secretary of State. If the Committee promises not to tell anyone outside the Room, I shall divulge a trade secret. Even with the best will in the world, it is quite difficult for a Secretary of State and his Department to reach a decision on a difficult and complicated matter in 15 days. Such matters must be dealt with properly and carefully. It is possible that the people preparing the case for the ultimate decision of the Secretary of State may require further evidence or material. I hope that the Committee would want such cases to be handled with care and that it will accept the possibility that to do so might take more than 15 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is unacceptable. The attempt to meet the very tight deadline of 15 days could mean that a case might not be dealt with as carefully as it deserves, given the sensitive nature of such matters. I understand the motivation behind the amendment, but I cannot recommend that the Committee accept it. Moreover, I would apply the same reasoning to almost any arbitrary deadline that might be imposed on a process such as this. Of course, every effort will be made to expedite such matters and to deal with them as rapidly as is consistent with care. It is almost certainly more important to deal with such matters properly and ensure that the Secretary of States judgment is right than to impose a tight, arbitrary time limit and risk getting the judgment wrong for the sake of unnecessary haste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that response. It seems that he is willing to go part of the way towards the amendment. Clearly, he will tidy up the Bill, as he has said before. I hope that he succeeds in returning with a wording that would not demand anything of the Secretary of State but merely strongly suggest to him that he should attempt to reach a decision within the suggested time limit. Everyone will understand that, for reasons of justice, he may have to go beyond that limit. I am sure that the Minister will be able to achieve that, given his grasp and flair. He appears to have promised to do so and I am grateful to him. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 is important because the clause requires that a fifth committee be established or a conference be convened in order to draw up an agreed syllabus for religious education once the 75 per cent. exit point has been passed. The fifth committee would be comprised of representatives of former county opted-out school governing bodies. The other four committees would be from the LEAs, the Church of England, other religious denominations and teacher associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find it a little difficult to understand the reason for the inclusion of subsections (5) and (6). The words in subsection (5) are markedly different from those used in the Education Act 1944, which set out procedures for the preparation and bringing into operation of an agreed syllabus on religious instruction. Under the fifth schedule of the 1944 Act, it was required of an LEA
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before appointing a person to represent any denomination or associations as a member of any such committee, a local education authority shall take all reasonable steps to assure themselves that he is representative thereof."</p></blockquote>
The concept of a representative is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(5) requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local education authority shall take all reasonable steps to assure themselves that he is acceptable"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
to the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools. The wording in the 1944 Act requires that a person is merely representative, but the Bill requires that he is acceptable to governing bodies. What will be the impact on the difference in wording? Has the 1944 Act stood the test of time? Conservative Members may argue that the Act's time has now expired, although on occasions they are moved to pay tribute to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear that the difference in the wording has been brought about by the change in social attitudes between 1944 and now. The Bill would place a more stringent test on the LEA. Although clause 10(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"no proceedings under that Schedule shall be invalidated on the grounds that the person was not so acceptable"</p></blockquote>
it would not provide the LEA with a get-out. We should assume that the LEA will behave consistently with the clause. The get-out should be used when, for reasons that are beyond the LEA's powers, someone is appointed who proves to be unacceptable. The difference in wording is important because the clause imposes a more stringent duty upon the LEA.

It is also fair to point out that we are considering convening a committee at a time when the LEA's historic role will have ceased, because its powers will have been passed to the funding agency. The measure imposes a stringent duty on LEAs, although they have been invited to withdraw from the education sector. I hope that the Minister will appreciate our anxieties and accept that we are genuinely trying to understand what lies behind the wording in the clause. I hope that he will assure the Committee that the clause does not place an unreasonable burden on LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State and the Minister for their expression, in the clause, of confidence in LEAs. LEAs have kept religious education alive in schools in Britain. My reservations about the standing advisory councils on religious education and their meetings to discuss the syllabus are made in the context of my admiration for what LEAs have achieved in difficult circumstances, which have included training people who are not religious education teachers. The standing advisory councils on religious education have met in public and in private. It is not necessary to include in the Bill a requirement for those councils to meet in public. However, in principle, their meetings should be held in public. Those meetings are the best method of informing the public about what is happening and ensuring—I shall put this delicately—that some hon. Members do not have misconceptions about religious education in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the DFE's sanction, not all LEAs have consulted all major denominations in preparing their syllabuses. I do not refer to Muslims, Hindus or Jews, but, to, for example Pentecostalates. There are many in some areas and they feel that they have been excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend does not want to use an incorrect term. The correct term is, "Pentecostalists".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is late at night. I apologise to my hon. Friend for that slip. I refer to the Pentecostal church, but to the Pentecostalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ethnic minorities should be consulted about the syllabus. They are widely spread throughout our
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
secondary and primary schools, with a greater concentration in some areas. Muslims say that, even in schools in which 80 per cent. of the pupils are Muslim, they do not find the approach to religious education satisfactory. That matter should be treated with delicacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that in a place such as Featherstone, which is not known for its ethnic minorities—although I suppose that those of us who come from there could be called an ethnic minority—the teaching of different religions should be imposed. However, children from Featherstone will go to other places and should be made aware of the beliefs of other religions and faiths. The Anglican and Catholic syllabuses recognise that. Indeed, the bishops' syllabus in the Catholic Church has been strongly criticised by the odd recalcitrant, backward-looking priest for studying the Muslim and Hindu faiths. That is an important part of a syllabus, which we believe should figure largely in its preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agencies should have some knowledge of what is happening in this respect. I do not say intereference, because the Minister and Secretary of State have, very wisely, left the funding agencies out of this. The agencies are unlikely to have religious education expertise, just as they will not have expertise in any other subject. Nevertheless, they will be dealing with schols which may be predominantly Christian, Muslim or neither. It is therefore important that the funding agencies should know about an agreed syllabus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one very contentious matter, which is somewhat insulting in the Bill. I refer to the position of grant-maintained schools regarding the standing advisory councils on religious education. I applaud the fact that the schools will take part in preparing the syllabus. They should be consulted. However, it is wrong that they can influence what goes in the syllabus and then withdraw from accepting it. If they, quite rightly, have an input, there is no earthly reason for not accepting the syllabus. A private school put forward the spurious argument that that was all well and good, but it wanted to have a particular GCSE syllabus—I shall not mention the name of the board—as it was very easy to teach. The school actually meant that it had teachers who could teach that syllabus. That is often a good reason for a school to accept a particular syllabus. That is why I do not like the way in which the national curriculum if often laid down, although you would quite rightly rebuke me, Sir John, if I were to tread that path and stray from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say no more about the national curriculum, except in so far as it concerns the syllabus of religious education. The marrying of religious education with GCSEs is a difficult issue that will arise later, when we consider the values of schools, which are tremendously important. I shall later make criticisms and suggest ways to strengthen the Bill in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to distinguish at the outset between values and examination subject in terms of the syllabus. That was easy because there were examinations in scripture and in religious education. Examinations in scripture are easy until a fairly advanced level as all that is examined is a corpus of knowledge—who allegedly did what and when. There is no question of rationalising or analysing the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not what the SACRE syllabus would do. I declare an interest: for a long time I was a member of such a committee in Wakefield metropolitan district council, although not when I was teaching. It is always
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
difficult to agree values and syllabus. People regularly confuse knowledge and values. Values may arise from knowledge—to have knowledge is to produce values. However, values must be deep rooted in all that we do. I hope that the Minister will listen to what we have to say. I have spoken for myself on the issue and may have strayed into pastures where my hon. Friends would not follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be able to break my duck and exercise my vocal chords. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd for his kind opening remarks. In due course, he may not feel so charitable towards me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Stretford and for Hemsworth made interesting speeches on the amendments. Both were right to stress the paramount importance of the moral and spiritual dimension of school education, which appeared in section 1 of the Education Reform Act 1988. The hon. Gentlemen rightly referred to the 1944 Act, the spirit and letter of which is incorporated in the 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford made great play of the distinction between the words "representative" in the 1944 Act and "acceptable" in the Bill. As long as the people chosen for the additional committee are acceptable to a majority of governing bodies of grant-maintained schools
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
in circumstanceas in which 75 per cent. of secondary and primary pupils in the area are in the grant-maintained sector, there is the prospect that the committee will be representative of that sector and thus deserve to be included in these arrangements. If they are part of the arrangements, they are more likely to pull their weight and to contribute constructively than if they were outside. There would be no natural justice in their being outside the arrangements for agreed syllabus conferences or for standing advisory committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that he was arguing about a distinction without a difference when he referred to the apparent contrast between the words "representative" and "acceptable". I assure him that they amount to the same thing: a desire to see that those people truly speak for the grant-maintained sector in the matter of the curriculum
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford alluded to the fact that this was an unreasonable test to impose on LEAs. As LEAs are responsible for convening the bodies, they should be responsible for seeing that the bodies are truly representative of the traditional committees of representation and of the new grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
