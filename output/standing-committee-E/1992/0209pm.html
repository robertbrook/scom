	<section>
	<div class='title'>DUTY OF GOVERNING BODY TO CONSIDER BALLOT ON GRANT-MAINTAINED STATUS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'.—(1) The Secretary of State may by order provide for this section to apply, in relation to such area as may be specified, to the governing bodies of schools which are eliggible for grant-maintained status.
	<ol>
	<li>Where this section applies to a governing body of a school, they shall, at least once in every school year, consider whether to hold a ballot of parents on the question of whether grant-maintained status should be sought for the school.</li>
	<li>Subsection (2) above does not apply in respect of any school year if a ballot has been held in accordance with section 20 of this Act in the school year which precedes it.</li>
	<li>The annual report of any governing body to which this section applies shall include—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a statement indicating that in the period since their last report the governing body have considered whether to hold a ballot of parents in pursuance of subsection (2) above and giving—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>particulars of any decisions made by the governing body following such consideration and the date or dates on which they were made, and</li>
	<li>if the governing body decided not to hold a ballot, an explanation of the reasons for that decision, or</li>
</ol>
	<li>a statement indicating that in that period the governing body have not, for the reasons given in the statement, considered whether to hold a ballot of parents on the question of whether grant-maintained status should be sought for the school.</li>
</ol>
	<li>In this section, "annual report" means the report prepared under the articles of government for the school in accordance with section 30 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986.' 	<i>[Mr. Forth]</i></li>
</ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. It might help the Committee to complete unfinished business from our previous sitting and, particularly, to assist the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) who asked me about the possible applicability of the Trade Description Act 1968 to the provision of information by schools if I say that I have taken advice. The provisions of the Trade Description Act are unlikely to apply to the provision of information by the governing body of a maintained school because the 1968 Act applies to statements made
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of a trade or business."</p></blockquote>
Ultimately, the courts will decide, but we do not consider that the provision of information by the governing body of a maintained school would be held to be something done in the course of a trade or business. For those reasons, I do not believe that the provisions of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1474</span>
Trade Description Act 1968 would apply to information provided by a school governing body. I hope that that helps the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I thank the Minister for that response, although it makes me a little unhappy about the dissemination of information. Will the Minister consider drafting advice or guidance to ensure that any information disseminated by a school or a college through the two amendments that we discussed this morning will be accurate and that there will be legal recourse if the school or college did not do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I am happy to study the matter again. We have established that it is not covered by the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and, therefore, we may wish to consider further guidance to schools to ensure that the problem that the hon. Gentleman raised does not arise. I shall study it again to see if there may be a problem and, if so, to decide on the most appropriate way of dealing with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 50 ensures that the governing body holds a discussion, at least once a year, about whether to hold a ballot on keeping grant-maintained status. In this morning's sitting, I said that that will cause a great upheaval in the governing body. Those of us who have served on governing bodies have no doubts about the strength of feeling that parents and governors have on this issue and the need to lobby and supply information which is very time consuming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discussion about a ballot will also be resource consuming; people will feel the need to pass on information through leaflets or by dissemination through a meeting, which means that the important issues that governing bodies spend a great deal of time discussing—such as the curriculum, examination results, staffing, school buildings and special needs—will be neglected while the governing body discusses the grant-maintained status ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even worse, if a governing body decides to choose a parental ballot, that will create upheaval in the school. We are giving maintained schools another burden to drag them down. Maintained schools have inadequate funds and are under constant Government pressure to relinquish their local authority links, which many of them value enormously because of the support and atmosphere that the LEAs provide. They will now suffer the frequent turmoil of an annual discussion of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members want a level playing field. Parents have had their arms twisted behind their backs by the Government. They have been told, "Choose path A and we'll let you go: choose path B and we'll break your arms". We should be talking about substituting the word "freedom" for "choice". Earlier in the debate I talked about substituting the word "democracy" for "diversity". A Bill that dealt with freedom and democracy rather than choice and diversity would be much better and would improve education in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been advised that the objective of new clause 50 could be achieved by regulation. Therefore, will the Minister say why the new clause has been tabled? Perhaps you will allow me a brief diversion, Sir John, to draw a parallel between the Bill and the work that I did before I became a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1475</span>
One of my responsibilities previously was to run a department that planned, supplied and delivered computer systems to other organisations. In that work, I learnt that two things could go wrong with a computer system delivery—WIBNI and OSINTOT. WIBNI was the acronym describing the moment when a person who was about too take delivery of a computer system said, "Wouldn't it be nice if …?" We would then receive a list of requirements that did not feature in the original specifications, with the result that the project went way over budget and often failed. OSINTOT was the acronym for "Oh shucks I'd not thought of that"—although that is a bowdlerisation enforced by the need to use parliamentary language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the new clauses that we have discussed today fell into one or other of the categories that I have described, but new clause 50 is definitely a WIBNI. It seems to have been a response to pressure from right-wing Conservative Back Benchers, who are dismayed at the progress in achieving grant-maintained status in schools and who have said, "Wouldn't it be nice if we could reach the Government targets on grant-maintained status?" or "Wouldn't it be nice if a few more schools opted out?" We must cease pretending that new clause 50 is about free choice. It is about tilting the playing field so that schools are forced to opt for grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 50 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide for this section to apply, in relation to such areas as may be specified". I take that to mean that the Secretary of State has to specify the areas to which he wishes the new clause to apply. Why? That suggests to me that some areas will not have to comply. If so, how will the Secretary of State choose those areas and will he have to give his reasons? I hope that the Minister will answer those questions when he responds to the debate.</p></blockquote>
New clause 50 is all to do with Conservative dogma. It has nothing to do with raising standards or improving choice. The only diversity that it will produce is a widening in the funding gap between schools at the top and bottom of the pile. I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome new clause 50. I am delighted that it has been proposed. Many Conservative Members were disappointed that such a provision was not included in the original Bill. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] There is no secret about that. We believe that grant-maintained status benefits schools. We wish to encourage schools to consider opting for that status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) and I wondered to which clause she referred. The new clause is unexceptional and would provide an opportunity for governing bodies to consider grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the new clause provides a choice for governing bodies. It does not. It compels them to consider grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition ignore the fact that the key decision is not made when governors consider grant-maintained status, but when parents vote democratically on the proposal. I emphasise the parents' role, which is retained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1476</span>
The new clause would remove some barriers and inertia from the education system. I served on a school governing body. I know the obstacles to governors' consideration of grant-maintained status. The head teacher is often in a difficult position. In some schools, the head teacher is the driving force in favour of that status, but he or she sometimes finds it difficult to persuade the chairman of governors that that is a good idea. If the chairman cannot be persuaded, the proposal does not proceed. Conversely, the head teacher is sometimes unenthusiastic, while the chairman of governors supports the proposal. It is difficult to reach the stage when governors can legitimately consider the proposal. Other members of the governing body take the lead from the head teacher or the chairman of governors. Inertia can be felt about even considering grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall), the clause compels governors to consider grant-maintained status. I support that. Governors are entitled to decide that they do not wish the school to become grant maintained. That would be the end of the matter. A parental ballot would not be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned freedom, democracy, choice and diversity. It is democratic to allow parents to vote—that is the key aspect in the process of deciding whether a school becomes grant maintained. What do the Opposition fear? Why are they so scared of giving parents a choice? We do not force schools to become grant maintained—some people believe that that is a pity. Perhaps I am one of them, but the Bill rightly and properly gives parents a choice. Parents are important in the process. I welcome the new clause, which would remove more barriers that prevent parents from exercising choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said during our previous sitting that my contribution on Thursday was possibly my last to the Committee. However, Conservative Members will have to contain their disappointment because I wish to speak during the debate. We have heard the voice of democratic reason, all the way from Croydon, North-East. He has let the cat out of the bag again by telling us that it is a pity that governing bodies will not be forced to opt for grant-maintained status. When the Minister responds to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon), will he tell us whether his views reflect Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the brave new world of Toryism, who sets the agenda in our schools for the education of our children in the 1990s and beyond? We have been told that that is the task of shcools' governing bodies, which have been given many new powers, and that responsibility will be handed to parents. The power of governors grows daily. They are now an all-powerful body because a new title has been invented by the Department of Education or the Secretary of State himself: "The Head of Governors", so addressed in a letter sent in the past fortnight. The letter was marked, "Urgent. Key Stage 3 material". It was so urgent that it was not sent to the head teacher of the school who has the responsibility of ensuring that its' contents are implemented in the school but to the head of governors, the new, all-powerful person who is more influential than the head of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard fine words about charters and about giving new power to people. The governors have set their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1477</span>
own agenda so that people will be free from the fetters of Government. In our early debates in this Committee, the Under-Secretary for Schools talked about schools becoming grant maintained and "leaving town hall control" or "leaving the grasp of the local education authority". How free are the governing bodies? I can tell the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East that the governing bodies now spend more and more time discussing more and more legislation, almost to the point of exhaustion. Meetings go on until well after midnight in many cases, pushing people well beyond the bounds of normal expectation. What are the governing bodies implementing? They are implementing the policies of national testing. There is national inspection, the national curriculum and, in this Bill, the national funding agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "Excellent," but what the Government have done is to nationalise the education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman gives way, I hope that he will relate his remarks more closely to the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the Bill will result in powers being taken from governors, rather than being given to them, as the new clause suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have not considered the matter of national minimum funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill had been about setting minimum standards and minimum funding, I and my hon. Friends would support the clauses that would put that into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will tell the governors what should go on their agenda; the new, all-powerful head of governors is not deemed capable of drawing up an agenda. Perhaps the DFE will send out guidelines on how to set out an agenda. I can just see it—item 1, apologies; item 2, minutes of last meeting; item 3, discuss opt out yet again; item 4, discuss why the last ballot failed; item 5—this is important—discuss the financial cost, the emotional cost and the educational cost of constantly considering opting out and the balloting process. When a school held a ballot on opting out in Plymouth, it caused almighty dissension within the local community and the school. That ballot took place just over a year ago and they are still healing the wounds from the controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on a similar case, in which a ballot to opt out took place in Gowerton high school in west Glamorgan? In a turnout of more than 17 per cent., the vote was more than 2:1 against becoming grant maintained. The chairman of the governors said that he disagreed with the parents and that he would raise the issue again at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the worst example of what the proposals could mean. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) noted that the Blatchington Mill school in east Sussex has just voted 4:1 against opting out. Are we suggesting that such a school must, in six months time, reconsider opting out and go through the entire divisive process again? I hope that good sense will prevail and that communities will not constantly be in a state of upset and division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1478</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is shaking his head as though that should not happen. I noticed that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye was nodding, as though such disruption should continue in that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was shaking my head because the hon. Gentleman glibly slipped in a time of six months later. That puzzled me because the new clause has nothing to do with six months. I hope that he will alter his diatribe to include the time of 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain why I mentioned six months. If a school were to consider opting out and holding another ballot at least within a year, as the new clause specifies, it would have to plan for that six months beforehand to set in motion the necessary processes. I am pleased to be able to instruct the Minister on how governing bodies operate because it is clear from the new clause that he does not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A little note would have to be included at the end of the agenda for members of the governing body saying something like, "If a decision is made not to hold a ballot, you will have to write a little essay for the annual report, entitled 'My reasons for voting against opt out'." That is what the new clause suggests. The governing body must keep justifying its reasons year after year, despite the fact that its report is available to parents. There are parent representatives on the governing bodies who can make known parents' views and inform parents of other views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if a governing body does not consider opt out ballots within the year? Will sanctions be taken against the governors? Will the Minister take legal action against them? What will be the ultimate sanction? Will the Minister imprison the governors? Will he fine them? Will he tell the Committee what he will do to individual, unpaid members of governing bodies, who give much of their lives to their schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East said, we are happy for governing bodies to discuss the matter as they wish. Obviously, Conservative Members are not confident to leave that choice to governing bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon. Gentleman so afraid to oblige governors simply to consider once a year whether the school becomes grant maintained? He mentioned that a ballot in a school in his constituency caused much disruption. I understand that. However, this is about allowing or forcing—I have no problem with such compulsion—governors to consider whether they ballot parents. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) is scared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that a Russian recently described our system as Stalinist. When I listen to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East, I understand why Russians think that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is saying that governing bodies, which are supposed to have independent powers over the way in which they manage schools, will be "forced" to put items on to the agenda. My first objection to that is that, in a democratic society, governors should not be forced to put anything on to the agenda. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-East is telling us that if governors discuss opting out, that does not include discussion about having a ballot to become a grant-maintained school. If it is not about having a ballot, what is it about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1479</span>
My second objection—for the benefit of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East—is that schools should not be in the process of balloting and reballoting year after year until they are "forced" to—to use the hon. Gentleman's word—to become grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way with his characteristic courtesy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to answer. I am happy for governing bodies to discuss such matters because they are part of the law. I wish that they were not part of the law and if the Labour party had had its way they would not have been. Schools would have then been able to continue their happy relationship with LEAs. All the goodness that flows from LEAs would have continued.

Is the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) arguing that, under the present arrangements, governing bodies cannot be trusted to discuss such matters when they see fit and without the law obliging them to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy has manifestly failed. We are not afraid of that fact. We have pointed it out many times. The target was that 11,000 schools would have opted out by now, but barely 600 have. Very few ballots are taking place. Of those that are taking place, many are voting against grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, again with his usual courtesy, and for remaining silent. If the hon. Gentleman puts his hand on his heart, is he saying to schools "we are happy for you to consider opting out even though we do not agree with it"? Is that a credible position to hold and does it do credit to the hon. Gentleman and to the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a curious intervention and it proves what I had thought. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made our position clear. We are totally opposed to the setting up of grant-maintained schools. Once again I shall tell the hon. Gentleman that Labour Members are opposed to that and the breakdown of the relationship between schools and LEAs. I am pleased to make that clear to the hon. Gentleman because he did not appear to understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My essential objection to the amendment is that it compels governors to put certain issues on to their agenda. In a democracy, they should not be under that compulsion. Listening to the Minister and the Secretary of State, I thought that they were proposing that the agenda for schools would be set by the governors and parents. That is clearly not the case. The agenda will be set by the Secretary of State for Education in a desperate bid to nationalise our state education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Cambridge, for which I apologise, I have listened with great interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East and the hon. Member for Devonport. It is extraordinary that the hon. Member for Devonport talks about democracy, because if it were not for the Government's actions governors would have no choice at all. LEA schools do a good job, but governors would have had no choice but the present maintained sector under local authority control. The system before grant-maintained schools were introduced provided no choice. There was no opportunity for governors to say what kind of school they wanted. Under the Opposition's proposal, the only people who would have a choice would be those parents who could afford to send their children to independent schools. The Labour party's opposition is hypocritical: only the Government have introduced choice into the maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because he is again referring to choice. Once a school has become grant-maintained, what choice does it have about moving back under LEA control? It has none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal more choice under the Government proposals and under the Bill. The status quo, which the Opposition are defending, offers no choice. The only choice would lie with the parents who could afford to send their children to the independent sector. That cannot be right. The Government are right to introduce other types of schools. We referred earlier to city technology colleges: I supported that idea enthusiastically and we would like it developed. We have introduced choice in other aspects as well, including the choice provided by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport may have read in the newspapers that many people campaigned some years ago not for the step-by-step introduction of grant-maintained schools as we have done—it is reasonable to give governors choice—but for the direct funding of all maintained schools. Many people in the Conservative party campaigned for that, but the idea did not come from one political party; the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers was also in favour of it at one time, even if it is not still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not so long ago, I introduced an early-day motion that secured 90 signatures for a proposal to move the whole of the maintained sector to direct funding by the state in one go. That was supported by members of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers and a number of teachers, many of whom were not supporters of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman is off the subject. I merely wish to know which official documents of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers show its support for grant-maintained schools before they were introduced. I have followed its affairs closely, but I have not heard it suggest such a policy or known it to hold a ballot on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise, Sir John, that if I were to answer that question at length I would definitely be straying from the amendment. I did not use the term "grant-maintained schools"—I referred to direct funding of education as opposed to funding by local authorities. I should be happy to give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse in support of what I said, and will show him the letters on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport referred to national minimum funding and said that he would support it if it were ever proposed. That reveals the hon. Gentleman's misunderstanding of the status quo, in which maintained schools are supported through the local education authorities. Before the general election, the Select Committee on Education raised the matter of achieving greater transparency in the funding of education. I have long campaigned for that. Constituents write many letters about spending in county authority areas, but it is difficult to identify how much an authority can spend. My hon. Friend the Minister wrote to me last week—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should be happy to give way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must return to the subject of balloting. He has not mentioned it yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was picking up on a point made by the hon. Member for Devonport, Sir John. The new clause would enable governors to have on their agenda the possibility of discussing a ballot. The hon. Gentleman said that he supported the idea of national minimum funding. I wanted merely to point out that under the present system there is no transparency of funding. My hon. Friend the Minister noted in a letter to me that the Government do not make assumptions about the amount that local authorities will spend on schools. Therefore, what the hon. Member for Devonport said about minimum funding makes no sense under present arrangements—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Devonport wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will intervene. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has read the new clause. Nothing he has said has borne any relation to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point. What is curious is that I was replying to a matter raised by him. It sounds as though we are both off the point, Sir John: I had better move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East that the Government's proposals are reasonable. The Opposition never miss a chance to attack any perceived threat to vested interests. I have tried to explain that the Government's proposals are more democratic than the status quo. They are more reasonable than many other proposals tabled by hon. Members at other times in this Committee. New clause 50 will mean that, at least once a year, governors will be able to consider opting out. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East that, rather than being undemocratic, that is reasonable and spreads choice. It is in line with the White Paper, which promotes choice, diversity and quality in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question already. The Government are introducing choice for governors, parents and teachers that was not available before. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, positive choice. The Opposition's proposals would mean no choice. They would simply maintain the system under local education authority control. The Opposition would not have introduced city technology colleges or any other form of choice. Therefore, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point, and I shall now give way to the hon. Member for Devonport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the new clause was in line with the White Paper. Where does the White Paper mention ballots each year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I actually said that the spirit of the Bill and the concepts of extending choice for parents and extending the diversity and quality of education were in line with the White Paper. I believe that the White Paper is fulfilled by the Bill and that the Opposition's objections, which are to do with vested interests and are not in tune with providing more choice for parents and a better quality education for children, should be opposed. The new clause should be supported, as should the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember clearly that a number of Conservative manifestos have referred to increasing individual autonomy and rolling back the frontiers of the state. New clause 50 will reintroduce compulsion by instructing governing bodies to consider once a year whether they should seek parental views on the school obtaining grant-maintained status. Such a proposal clearly rolls forward the frontiers of the state. The new clause is not a liberating measure in any way, shape or form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my criticisms concerning the new clause is the way that it has been introduced. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge informed us that the Secretary of State for Education did not announce the introduction of this measure to the Committee, to the House of Commons, in an addition to the White Paper or in a letter to individual hon. Members, but in an article in 	<i>The Sunday Times.</i> The Secretary of State has not bothered to attend one of the Committee's 34 sittings. The Committee and the House have, to some extent, been treated with contempt. I hope that our legislation is not to be fashioned by way of articles in national newspapers rather than by being introduced to a forum in our seat of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of this measure is an exception to the rule. Other amendments which have been proposed after the Bill has been drafted have usually been announced in the form of a letter from the Ministers to individual members of the Committee. I recall clearly the Minister's concession on special educational needs. It would have been far better if the Government had announced the introduction of the new clause in a similar fashion. Their way of introducing it shows the cavalier way in which they frame legislation and the utter contempt with which they treat anyone who has the temerity to oppose their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know why the new clause has been introduced at this late stage. It is quite straightforward—most of the Government's rhetoric in support of every clause of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1483</span>
Bill has concentrated on freedom of choice. If this provision had been included in the Bill from the outset, every time the Government and their supporters started their rhetoric about choice, we could have pointed to this proposal and said, "So much for choice." The new clause undermines the concept of choice: it tells governing bodies, "You will do this." It does not give them the opportunity to decide, in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson). They are being instructed—the Government are forcing their way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies to this debate, will he share with us the responses he received to the White Paper and tell us how many submissions he received during the consultations from school governing bodies saying, "We think that you should introduce a new clause to the Bill to compel school governing bodies annually to consider whether parents should go for an opt-out ballot."? I bet that the answer is none. Does he have the courtesy to share that information with us? If the proposal had been in the White Paper, how could it have been called "Choice and Diversity"? The new clause contains measures of compulsion. An alternative title is "coercion and dictat". That is what the new clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard again this afternoon the rhetoric about parental choice and how important parental views are in determining schools' futures and whether they should apply for grant-maintained status to come under the direct control of this incompetent Tory Government. I do not apologise for again mentioning that the Calday Grange grammar school governing body went to great lengths to stop the co-option of governors on to it, while simultaneously holding meetings that had been called to discuss the next move in their application for grant-maintained status and their opt-out ballot without seven days' notice being given. The Government sat by and did nothing, even though the Secretary of State was informed of events. That is another example of why choice does not apply in practice, showing the gap between the rhetoric and practice of this centralising Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the next step? The hon. Member for Norwich, North said that there is no attempt to force parents to ballot. I suspect that the new clause has been put in the Bill because of the failure of the Education Reform Act 1988 and the trickle of applications for grant-maintained status. When it, too, fails, the Government—if they are in power—will force parents to ballot on grant-maintained status. That is another step along a path that can clearly be seen in Tory party legislation over the past 14 years. Coercion rarely works. When people are compelled to do something, they usually take the opposite view to those who are doing the compelling. That is what will happen in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be my last contribution to the debate. [HON. MEMBERS: "Shame."] Hon. Members may not encourage me to my feet again, but there is more of this speech. In my speech on Second Reading and my contributions in Committee, I have said that one of my biggest concerns is the threat to democracy, and that threat is encapsulated in the new clause. That is why we oppose it. We still have not had an answer to the fact that once a school has applied for and been granted grant-maintained status, there will be no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1484</span>
more choice about anything that it can do, such as moving back into the local authority education network should it wish to do so. That point has not been dealt with by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, who has moved from his place to brief the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Education Act 1944 went into its Committee stage, the then Secretary of State for Education, Rab Butler, made a promise. He said that he did not want future Secretaries of State to become education dictators. Neither do we, and that is why we oppose the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends the Members for Norwich, North and for Croydon, North-East. We have heard a ritualistic objection to anything to do with grant-maintained schools in the contributions of Opposition hon.

There has been an absence of any relationship between his remarks and the new clause, which provides for governing bodies to consider whether to hold a ballot and then to report to parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point. The new clause will force governing bodies to take decisions about choice. It is about coercion. Can the hon. Lady explain why governing bodies should be forced in this way to consider a parental ballot? What is the justification?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The choice is one for parents. The hon. Gentleman has forgotten that the decision lies with them. It has obviously been many years since he was a member of a governing body.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause has absolutely nothing to do with choice for parents; it is a coercive measure to force school governors to consider, at least once a year and possibly more, the issue of grant-maintained status.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely right that a governing body should consider whether a school should ballot for grant-maintained status every year.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of a governing body until recently. We got on with the business; we did not spend half the night talking and discussing, as the hon. Member for Devonport was trying to pretend happens on governing bodies. I can only think that the governing body sits half the night in discussion, if the hon. Member for Devonport is one of its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge said that if a governing body were to consider the grant-maintained issue once a year, it would take up a whole term. That is an extraordinary comment; we are not discussing legislation that was enacted yesterday, or last week, or last year—it is legislation that has been on the statute book since 1988. Governing bodies and parents know about it. Governing bodies should consider the ballot and report it to the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second stage should also be incorporated because I do not want the governing board to include an item on the agenda and then say, "We have considered it and put it to one side." I want it to explain the ballot to the parents because it is the parents who have the children who go to school—they have the responsibility and desire to keep standards high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the results of the previous parental ballot in Eirias high school, in Colwyn Bay—in the constituency of my hon.

That is 75 per cent. of the parents: of those, 80 per cent. voted in favour of the governors applying for GM status. Only 20 per cent. voted against. Does not that suggest to my hon.

The hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned her previous occupation and said that the problems she experienced were pertinent to the clause. Before I became a Member of Parliament, I ran a company and I know from that experience that if one ignores changes and opportunity and does not discuss matters that are relevant, one does not do the best for the company or its employees. If we ignore the opportunities available to schools through the grant-maintained process and the advantages that grant-maintained schools reported in a recent survey, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
will not ensure that schools do the best for their pupils. That is the fundamental issue in the Bill. The new clause will ensure that those opportunities are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows well that we have had that argument before.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the most important aspects about giving schools the opportunity to seek grant-maintained status is that those schools that already have that status report an increase in pupil and teacher numbers, an improvement in academic results and the appointment and retention of governors who are eager and willing to participate in the running of those schools.

The new clause does not extend choice. It attempts to save the Secretary of State's political skin. It is the last, desperate act of a Secretary of State who has said on record that 1,500 grant-maintained schools will exist by April 1994. That target will not be achieved and that has dawned on the Secretary of State. He has searched for a new device to dragoon schools into the grant-maintained sector. Financial incentives are no longer available, because parents cannot vote for additional resources. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced a review of public spending yesterday and the four candidates for the firing line. One is education. That is why the Minister has not made a clear statement about the common funding formula. The Treasury has removed the ground from underneath him. Further cuts will be made in education spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that the new clause does not compel a school to hold a ballot. However, it compels governors to consider, at least annually, whether to hold one. It will prove to be a massive political own goal. Many Opposition Members remember the trade union legislation, which required trade unions to ballot their members about political funds. The Government's motives were the same as they are now. They believed that if trade union members were compelled to hold a ballot, they would vote against a political fund, yet 100 per cent. of members voted for its retention and eight new trade unions voted for it. That was a Government own goal, as is the new clause. When governors discuss whether to hold a ballot, arguments will be presented to them. Many Opposition Members will meet the challenge—[HON. MEMBERS: "And make the change."] We shall meet the challenge and accept the responsibility of explaining fully what holding such a ballot means to governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel unable to support new clause 50 as it stands for three reasons. First, as the Minister has told us throughout the Committee stage, nothing irrelevant to the Bill should appear in it. We should be told clearly today that there is no need for new clause 50. The Secretary of State already has the power, under secondary legislation, to introduce the requirement for individual school governing bodies. That does not need to be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous. If the Secretary of State had proceeded in that way would not the hon. Member have been the first to jump to his feet and say that the Government were doing things behind closed doors, without proper debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is obvious. The Secretary of State has that power, which he will use whenever he wants to in other instances, but for cynical party-political reasons, probably to try to shore up support on his own Back Benches, he has had to introduce the new clause. It is irrelevant and I am taking the Minister's good advice in arguing that something irrelevant should not be in the Bill. I should be interested to hear the Minister say why the new clause is so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To advance the argument about irrelevance, would my hon. Friend consider why, if the benefits of grant-maintained status, and coming under the direct control of an incompetent Tory Government, are so compelling, is it necessary to force governing bodies to consider that option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a paradox of a Bill supposedly based on the idea of choice that it, will compel governing bodies to discuss that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I oppose the clause because it will be disruptive to governing bodies, which may not want to debate this emotive issue, yet will be compelled to do so at least once a year. I do not think that that will be helpful. Thirdly, I do not agree with the wording of subsection (1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide for this section to apply, in relation to such area as may be specified".</p></blockquote>
We need to be clear that not every LEA in the country will be covered by new clause 50. New clause 50 makes it clear that the area affected will be specified by order of the Secretary of State. The Minister should clarify the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>
meaning of "area". Have we reached the stage when the Secretaries of State for Education and for Wales will look at the maps of England and Wales respectively to see which local authority areas have no grant-maintained schools—good Conservative authorities such as Suffolk, East Sussex, North Yorkshire and Devon? Will the Secretary of State, when exercising the new power given to him by new clause say, "I know what areas I shall specify; I shall compel every governing body in Suffolk, East Sussex, North Yorkshire and Devon to consider grant-maintained status"? At the moment there is no good reason for them to seek grant-maintained status, so will the Secretary of State specify those areas to be compelled? He might not bother about Kent or Hillingdon or Lincolnshire or Essex, because, he may feel, they are going to opt out anyway. But because the governing bodies in the areas I have mentioned care about the education they offer to young people, and recognise that grant-maintained status is irrelevant, they will be compelled to debate the issue. I should be interested to hear from the Minister why we need this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the Committee we heard much from the Minister about the Government devolving powers to where they counted—to the governors, parents and schools. We know from our 34 sittings that that is pure rhetoric. If the Bill stripped away to the details, what remains is one that centralises power. There is probably no more appropriate way to begin to conclude the proceedings of the Committee than by considering new clause 50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will even determine the agenda items for a meeting of a school governing body, yet he believes in devolving power. He will decide item by item what governing bodies must consider. That is the reality of centralised control over our education system, which we have tried to resist throughtout the Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the huff and puff of some Opposition Members, I am reminded that we have spent much of the past blissfully happy 100 hours of discussion on the Bill listening to the hon. Member for Devonport. Pleasant fellow though he is, I have been trying to figure out of what he most reminds me when he speaks. I have come to the conclusion that he reminds me of a residential auctioneer who has a bit of dodgy property to sell and thinks that the more that he can push up and hype the price, the better chance he has of getting rid of it at just about reserve price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a classic example of that huffing and puffing and over-blown rhetoric this afternoon. The hon. Member for Devonport started by saying that the measure was compulsive and ended up by claiming that a proposal merely to ensure that a governing body, on behalf of parents, discussed annually an important, potential avenue for the development of their schools was a Stalinist measure. Along with the contribution of the hon. Member for Cambridge, that shows the Labour party's slightly schizophrenic attitude to grant-maintained schools. They dismiss them by saying that they will never work and never catch on. Yet, they are terrified that if governing bodies discuss such proposals once a year, grant-maintained schools may grow as a result of parents recognising the improvements that such status will bring to their schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the Committee's information, it was not the Labour party that said that the Government's proposals were Stalinist, but a party of visiting Russians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we should take any lessons from parties of visiting Russians, even though the Labour party may think that such views are important. Let me reiterate that it is in no way Stalinist to want to give governing bodies, on behalf of parents, the opportunity to discuss grant-maintained status, which may offer significant future benefits for their schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If grant-maintained status is such a wonderful thing, why must school governing bodies be forced to consider it annually?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that important matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Opposition Members referred to those most likely to raise the question of grant-maintained status in schools: heads, chairmen, or chairwomen of governing bodies. So great is the pressure on teachers and head teachers in many, mainly Labour-controlled LEAs not to mention grant-maintained status, however, that a number of them dare not raise that subject in front of their governing bodies. For example, Birmingham LEA told its teachers that if they seriously considered grant-maintained status, and if they worked for a grant-maintained school, they had no chance of returning to the main sector. In other words, their careers in effect would be truncated if they worked for grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain how Birmingham—much to my dismay—has reached the point at which more than 10 per cent. of children are in grant-maintained schools? Indeed, three or four other schools are balloting too consider grant-maintained status. Many schools in Birmingham have decided to ballot—some have voted to go grant maintained, and some have not. The implication that schools have been prevented by an atmosphere of fear from considering the option is not justified by the number of ballots that have taken place in the city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just because many schools and parents have had the strength to resist the blandishments of the LEA, it is not one iota less true that the LEA told teachers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At which school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Teachers at Great Barr school were told that their careers effectively would be truncated if they dared to consider grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making serious allegations that must be investigated. However, does he not agree that it is wrong for the governing body of a school that is considering opting out to make similar threats to employees? I have an example from Babington community college. A letter to parents from the chairman of governors—who is also the leader of the Conservative party in Leicestershire—stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents have asked whether any staff would leave if the College were to become Grant Maintained. We are confident that these anxieties are unfounded, but believe it is important to reassure parents on this point. In order to help parents, if you feel unable to work in Babington G. M. College, please return the form below to me by Wednesday, 27 January. I undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the names of the individual respondents."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
I hope that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) will condemn the reply form, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Please return to Mr. R. B. Osborne, c/o Babington Community College.</p></blockquote>
I would not be willing to work at Babington community college if it became Grant Maintained and would resign." There is then room for a signature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would condemn unreservedly any pressure from either side that got in the way of genuine and balanced debate. My point is that there have been instances—I shall describe one or two more—in which teachers and head teachers have been under pressure not to bring the matter before their governing bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Would he join me in seeking the Minister's condemnation of the example that I gave?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave that to my hon. Friend when he replies. However, Conservative Members want to ensure a balanced debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke about head teachers who have been under pressure. The following headline appeared in the Birmingham 	<i>Evening Mail:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Head breaks ban to call for opt-out".</p></blockquote>
Peter Whittaker, the head teacher of Hall Green school, was told not to make any comment about grant-maintained status. However, he wrote to parents and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe you have a right to know my view and to hear my advice on this all important matter. You deserve no less." He went on to say that he was convinced that GM status was the best option for Hall Green. Interestingly, the parents agreed with him—on 1 December, by a vote of 71 per cent., they opted to go grant maintained.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having some difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's logic. He told us that unbearable pressure was put on the staffs of Great Barr school and Hall Green school not to opt out. However, he then told us that both schools did opt out. Perhaps more pressure was exerted by people who wanted to opt out, as the hon. Gentleman said to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is simple enough even for the hon. Member for Devonport. Many Labour-controlled LEAs are telling their head teachers that any connection between them and grant-maintained schools, either before or after a ballot, will be condemned. In Birmingham, Carlton Duncan, who is head master of George Dixon school and, incidentally the first black head teacher in the city, was threatened in a letter sent to parents by the vice-chairman of the education committee. The vice-chairman accused him of not being able to control his budget or to run his school properly merely because his school was engaged in an opt-out ballot. Mr. Duncan is now suing for libel and the matter is sub judice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If head teachers are subject to such appalling pressure from LEAs when they are seriously considering moving their school to grant-maintained status and if they are not allowed to raise the subject with their governing bodies, the new clause and the Government's aims are justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak ill of my former deputy head, Mr. Carlton Duncan, but will the hon. Gentleman comment on the amount of money that Mr. Duncan spent in making the case for opting out to his parents? He distributed a glossy brochure at the cost of £2,500. Another head in Birmingham decided to distribute information in favour of opting out through the school post and it cost £1 to send each envelope to the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
In his desire to be even-handed and to avoid the creation of an atmosphere of fear, will the hon. Member for Wyre Forest take the opportunity to criticise Carlton Duncan and George Dixon school for spending such a grossly inflated amount of money when such sums were not available to the LEA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A clear distinction should be made. I do not know how much money was spent, but the head teacher and the governing body have a right—indeed, an obligation—to tell parents of their views on grant-maintained status. That is very different from the vice-chairman of the education committee in Birmingham sending a letter to parents which basically accused a head teacher of gross mismanagement. I want even-handed arguments that are conducted according to the Queensberry rules. Sadly, too many authorities, especially those that are Labour controlled and that in Birmingham, are not prepared to play according to those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 50 should be accepted because it ensures that parents have, as far as possible through the governing body, the opportunity to consider every conceivable avenue open to them that may improve standards at a school. Of course, grant-maintained status is open to all schools. We are ensuring—yes, that means compulsion—that such an opportunity exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comment that parents should be able to explore every avenue open to a school. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman referred to auctions. I offer him a deal. I would be happy to support the new clause if the Government introduced another one that would allow for annual discussion by the governing body on opting back in. It cannot be right that governing bodies are forced to discuss opting out year after year until they are forced to make the decision to opt out, but they then have no further ballots on opting in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made no secret of the fact that the Government are intent on maximising diversity and thereby maximising choice. As ballots on GM status have recently taken place, it would be inherently destabilising continually to raise the spectre of moving back from GM status to the maintained sector. Through the governing bodies, parents will be able to discuss an option that could be of great benefit to their schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is about to wind up his speech and I remind him that he promised me an answer to my question. If grant-maintained status is so attractive to schools, why should their governing bodies be compelled to consider it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had been listening, he would know that I have been dealing with that point, for the past 10 minutes. Unless that power is provided, sadly, in certain local education authority areas, such is the pressure on teachers and, to an extent, on governors that grant-maintained status will not even be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman advise the Committee whether school governing bodies are dominated by governors appointed by LEAs or other governors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the governing bodies consider whether to discuss grant-maintained status, they are still
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>
within the purview of the local education authority. Therefore, pressure not to have anything to do with the GM. status can be, and has been, exerted by some LEAs on teachers and governors. That can have a profound effect and, for that reason, I support new clause 50 which will increase diversity, improve standards in schools and ensure proper discussion of that important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting and it has thrown into stark relief many of the attitudes that we have witnessed throughout our proceedings. In many ways, it has been a microcosm of those proceedings because it emphasised the lack of realism displayed by Opposition Members. That was made apparent today by their over-statement of their case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why, if G.M. status is such an attractive proposition, school bodies must be compelled to discuss the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall deal with the "Warrington" question if he will allow me to develop my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with an issue that troubled the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and some of his hon. Friends. The hon. Gentleman seemed to change his ground as he went along on the question of whether the proposed duty would be coercive. Opposition Members used words such as "coercion" and "compulsion" to describe it and the hon. Gentleman said that the power would "dragoon" governing bodies and "coerce" their agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were those resonable descriptions, bearing in mind that what is proposed is merely a duty to consider? That duty is subject, first, to the wishes of the governing body as expressed by its vote on the resolution and, secondly, when it has had its say, it is subject to a ballot of the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been well made on a number of occasions, but I repeat it for the benefit of Opposition Members. Is it fair of them to talk about coercion and compulsion when, under their policy, governing bodies and parents would not be allowed to have a vote? The Opposition disagree with that process of voting, so what greater compulsion could there be than their policy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the "Warrington" question, which has also troubled the Opposition. The reason why it is important for that matter to be considered annually by governing bodies is that the question of opting for grant-maintained status can be ventilated. It is important for governing bodies to consider that question, to be accountable to parents in the way proposed in the new clause and to give reasons for their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to bring the whole process out into the open. The intervention of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh office was extremely enlightening. He said that many parents found grant-maintained status and its benefits desirable and that, when ballots have been held, there have been large majorities in favour of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have been on the horns of several dilemmas throughout the proceedings of the Committee. One has been the question of coercion and compulsion when they wanted to deny schools the opportunity to seek grant-maintained status. Another has been the question of accountability, which they have raised several times, but which now, they seem to have forgotten. It is important that government bodies are accountable to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1493</span>
They should state their views in annual reports so that parents have the opportunity of finding out what the governing body things about the important issue of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the weekend, we heard a speech from the leader of the Labour party, in which he carved out a whole new vision for his party. He said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It wasn't me guv.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, Opposition Members in the Committee have shown their disagreement with their leader throughout the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He used the words, "accountability", "individualism" and "choice". Where is the commitment of Opposition Members to those ideas in relation to making governing bodies accountable to parents, or letting parents have their say by means of a ballot, or allowing schools the opportunity to go their own way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard the hon. Gentleman answer the "Warrington" question. If it is good enough to ask governors of a maintained school at least annually to consider becoming grant-maintained and to go through the ballotting process, why is it not good enough to allow the governors of a grant-maintained school annually to consider whether to opt back into the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reminds me of the other occasion on which I heard that question posed. I have not heard that question asked outside the Committee on any other occasion except one because there is no evidence of disillusionment among parents of children at grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, perhaps the hon. Lady would like to say that to the more than 80 per cent. of grant-maintained schools that report increases in applications, both in the primary and secondary sectors. If parents are so disillusioned, why are applications increasing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Bridgend that the question that he asked was posed also by the headmaster of an extremely successful grant-maintained school, which had completely turned round in its fortunes, was attracting large numbers of extra applicants and was flourishing in the independence of the grant-maintained system. That headmaster said that he was only sorry that parents did not have the opportunity to vote again because, if they did, the majority in favour of grant-maintained status would be even higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously interested in whether disillusionment exists among parents, teachers and students of grant-maintained schools. Will he tell the Committee how, if he discovers that those people are disillusioned, those schools can opt out of grant-maintained status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that intervention. Hon. Members will have noticed that it was hypothetical. There is no such evidence. Opposition Members are so lacking in such evidence that they must pose the question hypothetically. The crux of the matter is that grant-maintained schools are associated, almost invariably, with rising standards. That is a question on which Opposition Members have burnt their fingers on several occasions. That includes the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1494</span>
Wallsend, who made one of the most important interventions of the Committee, when he asked the Minister for details about higher standards and about the HMI report. The Minister returned with the report that clearly confirmed, with evidence from throughout the country, that grant-maintained schools have higher standards. The hon. Gentleman ran away from the issue—it was clear that he had burnt his fingers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify the incident, which I remember well—the Minister would not give way to a second intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was uncharacteristic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I understand why. The Minister would have been aware from the HMI report that the reason for the performance being above average in those grant-maintained schools is simply that the proportion of grant-maintained schools that select their pupils is higher than the national average. Therefore, given that selection on ability occurs in a greater percentage of grant-maintained schools, one would expect performance to be above average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has also had the answer to the question that he posed about the number of grant-maintained schools that had applied to change their character to go selective. It was a small number. The HMI report found evidence of improving standards in grant-maintained schools—good schools became better and not-so-good schools became good. The evidence of that is clear across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes again, let me point out that we are getting wide of the subject. Performance of grant-maintained schools is not relevant to the question of balloting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that, Sir John. [HON. MEMBERS: "Saved."] If Opposition Members are so convinced, why are they afraid of grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want the legal mind of the hon. Gentleman to move away from the concept of evidence. He told the Committee that there was no evidence that schools that have opted out and taken grant-maintained status wish to opt back. Where is the evidence that school governing bodies demand that they be compulsorily instructed to consider opt-out ballots on an annual basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has returned to his original confusion about the difference between being compelled to consider an issue and actually being forced to go through with it. Is the hon. Gentleman so afraid of school governing bodies merely considering the question of grant-maintained status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence lies in the success of grant-maintained schools and the great interest among parents. Therefore, it is right that the whole question be opened up and ventilated as I have already explained to the hon. Gentleman, and that governing bodies be accountable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for affording me the courtesy that I

	<span class='label label-info column'>1495</span>
afforded him on several occasions. The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted evidence of parents who might wish to move from grant-maintained status back to the LEA. I shall help him just as I helped the hon. Member for Erewash when I recalled the case of one of the first schools to opt out—the Woodroffe school in Dorset, which has been well-publicised in the south-west. After one and a half years of grant-maintained status, the school had to sack seven teachers. I believe that the head teacher has been suspended. There were huge meetings of parents to demand what had gone wrong. Parents telephoned me asking whether the school could return to local authority control. That is the evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman a generalisation. If he thinks that that is evidence representing the grant-maintained sector across the country, he is clutching at straws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of balloting, we have experienced an important example of the double standards used by Opposition Members that have prevailed throughout the Committee. In the minds of Opposition Members, only a vote that they like is allowed to count. For every example such as the one given by the hon. Gentleman a moment ago, there are many other examples of grant-maintained schools that are succeeding. We have heard many reports from the Opposition about schools that have voted not to proceed with grant-maintained status. They ignore the fact that eight out of 10 schools are voting in favour of grant-maintained status. Why should those schools be told that their votes do not count? Why should only a no vote count?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those votes have favoured grant-maintained status, Opposition Members have been at pains to say that there has been a misrepresentation or that pressure was exerted. I do not think that that is the case. It is certainly not an argument that I would want to present to the parents of the five large secondary schools in my constituency who voted by more than 80 per cent. in favour of grant-maintained status. It was a matter entirely for them. They decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) gave examples of schools in her constituency that had voted against grant-maintained status. Perhaps she would like to talk to the parents of children at the school in Castle Hill in her constituency who voted by a large majority in favour of grant-maintained status. No doubt the hon. Lady will explain that by saying that the parents got it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It boils down to whether there is confidence in parental choice. We have such confidence. We believe in individualism, accountability and choice. The conduct of Opposition Members shows that the new model Labour party is a sham. It has not changed at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It had not been my intention to speak until the hon. Member for Hertsmere got into his stride. I noticed earlier that the hon. Gentleman's greatest orgasm of delight came when he beheld that local authority controlled schools were compelled to consider becoming grant-maintained schools at least once a year. He jumped up and down and squeaked about what a magnificent thing that was. In psychological terms, I found that very interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1496</span>
As you, Sir John, pointed out, we have got away from the core of the argument, which is about the nature of schools and governors and their relationship with local authorities and central Government. Is the Conservative party, in its central Government manifestation, the best body to judge what should happen in education? We have heard several ritualistic calls against local education authorities—if it is a local authority, it is bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Sir John, will recall as vividly as I do, Peter Walker, when he reformed local government. I almost said the late Peter Walker but, of course, he is active again in Government circles, so we must beware. Indeed, he is the noble Lord Walker. That was a Conservative reform if ever there was one. We warned against it and said that it was a ritualistic condemnation of local government, and so it turned out to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having spent huge sums on what the Tory party called two great reforms in the mid-1970s—that of the health service and of local government—the Government then had to spend huge sums on "putting things right". We know that they are still not right. We are worried about who will suffer, because we believe that the sufferers will be the pupils. If we follow the primrose path put there by the Government, there will be problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school is part not just of the parents, but of every level of society to which it belongs. I am not afraid of the word society. I know that there are young, up-and-coming Thatcherites who do not like that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And older ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as the older ones among Conservative members of the Committee. I am not frightened by the word society. I think that it is important for our schools to be part of society. Governors should mirror that society and their appointment should reflect society in its totality. In my part of the world there are fewer than 1 million Conservative votes. Pontefract and Castleford has one of the largest Labour majorities in the country. That is all to the good. However, we have made sure that every primary and secondary school has Conservative representation on the governing body. It is important that it reflects the cohesion of that society in Pontefract, and in Hemsworth. Every small fragment of society should be included in the governing body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear my hon. Friend correctly? Did he say that the local authority was able to find at least one Conservative to sit on every governing body or was that governorship shared out between the few there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In part, my hon. Friend is right. When we tell the Conservative party that it should nominate governors, it tends to nominate more people to multi-governorship than Labour does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. All this is a long way from balloting on grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was endeavouring to show that it is important for the governing body to be representative of the community. The outside coercion that the provision would undoubtedly introduce is not relevant to the well-functioning of the school. Indeed, that coercion may cause the school to malfunction. In every governing body to which I have belonged, either as a governor or in the days when I was teaching, I have always found that it is important to keep on board all sections of the governing

	<span class='label label-info column'>1497</span>
bodies. One has to ensure that issues that could be divisive are dealt with extremely delicately. The Minister's delicacy is not apparent in the new clause. The new clause would cause divisions between governors and force society to be divisive. That cannot be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little reluctant to get up, but I may have misheard my hon. Friend when he referred to the Minister. Surely it was not the Minister who constructed the new clause? According to 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> it was the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I unreservedly apologise to the Minister because I know that he has infinitely more sensibility than the Secretary of State. I certainly know from the letter that I received from the Minister this morning that his English is much better than that of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, when we discuss the role of governors we must also take into account how well the operation of the school is controlled. We know that the privatisation of governorships can lead to their total separation from their original intentions. Once more, I use the example of public schools. They used to be schools for poor people and are now for the rich. I fear that that is the primrose path that we tread.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I am sure that the Minister's further comments will be enlightening and he will try to square the circle. In previous discussions, the Minister showed no eagerness to go down the path of compelling governing bodies to have such discussion every year. It will be interesting to hear why the Minister has changed his mind on that matter since last month and why he now feels that it is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is perhaps the closest the Secretary of State has come to attending the Committee. His hand is plain in the writing of the new clause, but has not been evident in any other amendment. The new clause is clearly the latest sign of the Government's panic over the failure of their sacred policy on grant-maintained schools. The Secretary of State has had to review his estimate of the number of schools that will become grant maintained. The original estimate was that half the schools in the country would become grant maintained before the general election. That estimate fell to 4,000 and then to 1,500. It seems to be revised downwards whenever the subject is mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that the majority of grant-maintained schools had opted out to escape bad local authorities, but the vast majority of the schools that have opted out are in areas with Conservative-controlled councils. If discontent is the motive for leaving the local authority framework, it is obvious that the greatest discontent is with Conservative local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas—for example, East Sussex—there are no grant-maintained schools and the new clause may be directed at them by giving the Secretary of State yet more power to prescribe when the provision will operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to East Sussex. I believe that there was a parental ballot there and that parents voted by a majority of three or four to one not to become grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: the figures were four to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen several phases in the Government's attempt to persuade schools to become grant-maintained.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1498</span>
The new clause is the latest attempt to push schools in that direction. We had the bribery phase during which schools would receive a lot of money. We heard of schools fighting opt-out ballots with the pro-lobby using slogans such as, "If you vote to become grant-maintained, the school will be painted and you will have all the facilities, such as a new library, that you want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Lady reconcile her statement on the abolition of grant-maintained schools and the fact that they will be taken back into local government control with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition at the weekend when he moved away from the position which she occupies? Her right hon. and learned Friend is moving away from nationalisation, so why does the hon. Lady persist in wanting to take schools away from parents and back into local government control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply remind the hon. Gentleman that it was the Conservative Education Association which said that the White Paper and the Bill would lead to nationalisation of Britain's schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, we saw first the bribery tactics by the Secretary of State, but following yesterday's announcement by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, those tactics have probably ground to a full stop without even slowing down. Ministers are obviously considering other ways of trying to persuade schools to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a phase during which education officers were threatened and because the wicked villains of the piece. I do not know whether the Secretary of State or his junior Ministers have yet apologised to those education officers, but apologies are due to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial clauses of the Bill were introduced so that governors had to consider becoming grant maintained on only one occasion before moving to a ballot. Surprisingly, the Government accepted in spirit our amendment to prevent grant-maintained status from being bounced on a governing body under the item "any other business" on the agenda. Had we not tabled the amendment, a governing body might have to call a ballot without notification. It is against that background that we should consider the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has little to do with extending choice. It gives no new power to governors that they do not already have. They can debate grant-maintained status whenever they consider that appropriate. The proposal is not about extending choice to governors or to parents, but about forcing governing bodies to put an item on their agenda that the Minister considers appropriate. When he tells us that we should trust governing bodies and parents, we must take into account the new clause that would prescribe what must be part of the governors' agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ministers really had confidence in the Bill and in the promotion of grant-maintained schools, they would not have been so frightened of our amendments that would allow schools to opt back into local authority networks if they so wanted. The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to the Castle Hall school in my constituency which was scheduled for closure and, despite what Ministers have said, was allowed to opt out to avoid that closure. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the person who led the opt-out campaign for that school has said since then that that was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. He now believes that that school should not have opted out, and he has gone back on his previous thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1499</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the same argument apply to Heckmondwike grammar school? What about the 90 per cent. of parents who voted in favour of Castle Hall school becoming grant-maintained? Has the hon. Lady seen those parents individually to tell them that they got it wrong, and that she is on the side of the 9 per cent. of parents who voted against it becoming grant-maintained? Is that her idea of democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman for Hertsmere is stretching his point too far. Not only is Heckmondwike grammar school not in my constituency, but I did not participate in the ballot at Castle Hall school. I was quoting the person who led the opt-out campaign. He knows what he is talking about and he has seen the reality of what grant-maintained status can mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said that ballots can be divisive and he referred to a ballot that took place recently in a school in East Sussex. That ballot came about as a result of a petition that was signed by 821 parents. It was the trigger mechanism for the ballot. When the parents received information about the consequences of opting out, fewer than 200 out of 821 parents voted in favour. That meant that the community was split, as was the school and the governing body. That was damaging, time-consuming and no doubt expensive—and all for what? No change took place. Conservative Members are asking more schools and communities to go through such a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, the Minister acknowledged that the Bill is another measure that is aimed at centralisation. My hon. Friend asked the Minister whether he was always the best judge of what should happen in a school. The Minister said, "Undoubtedly. Who else could be better?" That theme has been running through the Bill time and again. The Government are intent on grabbing as much power as possible over as many schools in the country as they can. Schools are opting not out of local education authority control, but in to the centralised system under the personal political control of a Conservative Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers are obviously disappointed at the number of schools that have become grant maintained. They boast about the number, but they forget to remind us that there are still 24,500 to go. The clause is about the failure of the Government's policy so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, Sir John, in replying to the debate. I shall start with the ridiculous and work up to the sublime. The ridiculous was started by the hon. Member for Cambridge, but it was typically and vigorously taken up by the hon. Member for Devonport—who better to deal with the ridiculous than the hon. Gentleman, who has become something of an expert? They were both worried about the onerous burden on school governors of having to deal once a year with that great and problematical debate about whether grant-maintained status was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge talked about upheavals for governing bodies and said that such a debate would be time consuming. She said that it would take one term in every three. I do not know what sort of governing bodies the hon. Lady has served on—and that point was picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash—but if the chairmanship of those governing bodies was so eccentric as to allow such debates to cause upheaval and to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1500</span>
be endlessly time-consuming, and to take up one term in three, someone needs to examine how those governing bodies are run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After this sitting, will the Minister reflect on his own words reported in 	<i>Hansard</i> at columns 943 and 944? When referring to the possibility of my amendment on opting back in, he used words like chaos, confusion, and uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point later, although I rarely remember my own words because it is too painful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not seek to remind me of them too often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a big difference between the consideration by a governing body of a particular item on the agenda and the potential effect of a school's status moving backwards and forwards. I do not see those two items in the same light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would not want to feel that the Government were bouncing governing bodies into considering whether to hold a ballot of parents. I am sure that he will agree that if the matter is to be given proper and careful consideration it will take time and resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it will take time; whether it will take resources is a subject for debate. I expect that many governing bodies will have a crisp debate on the question, as one item on the agenda. Under an effective chairman and with a little self-discipline—the latter has occasionally been lacking here—the question could probably be disposed of fairly quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was also worried about the considerable resources needed to disseminate the information. New clause 50 refers to inclusion in the annual report to parents of the outcome of the governing body's debates. Having included in that annual report a reference to the outcome of that debate, it would not be unduly onerous to include a reference to the governing body's decision on whether grant-maintained status was appropriate. Mountains are being made out of molehills. We can dispose fairly quickly of the Opposition's suggestion that it would be an enormous burden on governing bodies. It need not be an enormous burden unless they want to make heavy weather of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then come to the argument about coercion—the word most often used by the Opposition—and that undemocratic coercion caused by the new clause on governing bodies was unacceptable. I reflected on that during the debate. If we look to the private sector, companies legislation requires public companies at their annual general meetings to consider certain matters each year—the appointment of auditors springs to mind, the election of directors, and adoption of the annual accounts. No one gets over-excited about that. No one complains that companies are obliged in the natural course of events to consider those matters on behalf of their shareholders and report to them in the annual report. That does not cause revolution or the reaction suggested by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is a qualitative difference between having to consider changing one's status in such a dramatic way as moving from LEA control to grant-maintained status, and the sort of considerations that apply to businesses. I remind him that there is already a requirement for governing bodies to consider in their annual reports
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1501</span>
statements on parental contributions. That is qualitatively quite different from consideration of such an important matter as the move to grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily concede that there is a qualitative difference between such matters. I do not shrink from that. I accept that they are different, as are the matters that I mentioned relating to companies regulations, but that does not rule them out as examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure where the Minister got the example of companies legislation, but it is not a good example, as his Government have amended the regulations so that the formerly strict requirement to report all details in the annual return to Companies house has been loosened. A company with a relatively small volume of trading no longer has to make a detailed return. There has been a move in the opposite direction to that in which the Government are moving in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman applauds that deregulatory measure, which has my full support. That does not mean, however, that companies are not obliged to appoint auditors annually or carry out other fundamental duties. I do not want to labour the point. As I listened to the debate, I tried to think of an appropriate example. If the Committee does not like that one, let me offer another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very House of Commons is obliged each year to consider and dispose of certain business important to it relating to the status of hon. Members, access to the House and other matters. I do not recall that hon. Members on either side of the House become over-excited about that. We take it in our stride and deal with it in a mature way. No one cries "coercion" or "a scar on the face of democracy".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Well entrenched in our democratic procedures is the idea of annual consideration of certain relevant matters. That is all that we seek to entrench by means of the new clause. It need not cause excitement or the reaction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is compulsion. The new clause compels governing bodies of schools to consider and report to parents on the status of the school. The Opposition seem to find that disgraceful, but it is a perfectly natural part of the process that we are building and developing in the Bill with respect to grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us why, if compulsion is necessary for maintained schools, there is no compulsion on grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What sort of compulsion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The compulsion to consider annually whether the school should opt back into LEA control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of good reasons for that. One is that the thrust of the Government's policy is to provide the option of change to grant-maintained status. The second is an important consideration—the chaos and confusion argument that the Opposition have deployed from time to time in Committee. It is difficult to contemplate a system in which schools could, annually or otherwise, move at will between grant-maintained and LEA status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most compelling reason, however, is that there may not be anything for them to opt back into. It is entirely
	<span class='label label-info column'>1502</span>
likely—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me finish the sentence. Opposition Members have missed the obvious, which is not unusual but fairly typical. If there was the to-ing and fro-ing option that they all seem to regard so highly, a point would come in most areas when there would no longer be an authority into which schools could opt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that if an LEA was available for schools to opt back into that would be a legitimate option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not concede that because it begins to make a complete nonsense—maybe Opposition Members want to do that—of the education system. The Bill sets out a framework within which the alternative of grant-maintained status can be contemplated as well as the ground rules and the mechanisms for it, and it offers governing bodies the opportunity to consider that issue once a year if the Committee accepts the new clause. All that is available to schools. It is difficult to contemplate how the mechanisms would work and what the frameworks would be if schools were allowed, at will, to opt in and out, back and forward, and up and down in order to change their status. That is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is truly about choice and diversity, does diversity not suggest that there will be schools, even on the Minister's reckoning, that are not suited to grant-maintained status. Should they therefore not have the right to opt back into local authority control? If, as the Minister suggests, there will be no local authority, to use his own phrase and that of several other Conservative Members, "What's the beef?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members adhere to a genuinely different principle. I do not accept their argument. Such an option could not work even if one wanted it to. It is crystal clear to everybody, including Opposition Members, what the option of grant-maintained status means. Opposition Members are obsessed with it. They still cannot make up their minds—a point made eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest—whether they are afraid of grant-maintained status and what it means or whether the number of schools is so derisorily small that it does not really matter. I am not concerned about what attitude Opposition Members will finally take. They can continue to take both attitudes if they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are content with the rate at which schools, through ballots, are choosing to become grant maintained. We believe that the current numbers are satisfactory and manageable and that they are developing at a satisfactory and manageable rate. I am happy with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister shed a little more light on his comment that there might not be an LEA to opt back into. I recall that in earlier sittings of the Committee we made a list of activities and responsibilities that LEAs would retain—statementing, attendance orders, transport and many more. If there is no LEA, who will carry out those responsibilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant a sufficiently viable authority which would be able to handle schools balloting to come back under its control.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there will be an LEA. It will almost certainly, in many circumstances, not be sufficiently viable to handle certain numbers of schools opting back in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter needs clarifying. A moment ago the Minister told us that there would be no LEA to opt back into. He has just told us that there always will be an LEA. Could he clarify that? Will the Bill get rid of LEAs or will they still exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will of course be continuing functions for LEAs, which we have made clear throughout the Committee. I suggest that it is highly doubtful whether in many cases, there will be a viable, operative LEA that could handle a number of schools choosing to opt back into its control as Labour Members suggest. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Warrington, South. I will use several words where one will do if he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if there were an LEA available that allowed schools to opt back, the Minister does not want grant-maintained schools to opt back and will not let them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The hon. Gentleman has got it in one. The penny has finally dropped. It has taken about 150 hours, but we have got there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just confirmed what Labour Members already believed to be the case—that the Bill is not about choice or even-handedness but about making all schools become grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was not quite sure whether we wanted or feared grant-maintained schools. Has not he understood another of our great concerns, which is the process that schools must go through—no matter whether they opt for or reject grant-maintained status—for the ballot to take place. His comment demonstrated the point. Conservative party members will do all that they can to persuade people to vote for grant-maintained status. Labour party members will do all that we can to ensure that they vote to be retained within LEA control. Can the Minister honestly say that all of the exchange of allegations that will occur while those two parties vigorously fight to defend what they think to be best, will be in the interests of children and will create a stable educational environment for our schools to operate in? Whether grant-maintained schools are good or bad, that remains a major objection. The process will generate instability. The new clause will only add to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our democratic institutions are not such delicate plants. We are used to elections. We have them nationally, locally and in many different ways. One should not suggest that our parents and governing bodies are not sufficiently robust to participate in the electoral process—within reasonable limits, I add immediately, because I am very aware of the examples that my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest adduced. Unreasonable pressures are brought to bear on governors, teachers, parents and heads from different quarters. That is worrying. I unreservedly condemn—as did my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest—the pressures that exist in both directions. Part of the aim of the Bill is to minimise such pressure and ensure that, under the terms of the new clause and the existing provisions, the debates of governing bodies are held in a reasonable, rational and well-informed atmosphere. That is an objective that we all share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1504</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Merely for the record, will the Minister clarify that he unreservedly condemns the behaviour of the chairman of Babbington school governors, which I drew to his attention earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do. I do not know how often I have to do so. It is not in my interest, or that of the Department or the Government, that undue coercion be brought to bear on schools for them to ballot over whether to become grant maintained. I want schools and parents to ballot freely and of their own volition and joyfully to become grant maintained, because that will make them better grant-maintained schools. It is not in my interest, nor of the Government, for schools to be dragooned into grant-maintained status and then not perform their new responsibilities well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for raising this matter in front of the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) without having given him notice of it, but I did not anticipate the trend of the Minister's arguments. If he condems coercion from either side, will he condem Conservative Members writing to schools in their constituency and cajoling heads, chairs of governors and others, arguing that the best way to get resources for their school is to become grant-maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is leading us into difficult territory. Some Opposition Members have written similar letters—often using House of Commons stationery, but I shall let that pass for the moment—in Birmingham, among other palces. It is legitimate for Members of Parliament to make known their views to their constituents. I do not know what coercion they can bring to bear. It would be a pretty wet and weedy chairman of governors who thought that utterances of Members of Parliament could influence them. I hope that governors will be robust enough to accept that Members of Parliament can huff and puff but, mercifully in many ways, do not have as much direct influence as the hon. Lady suggests. They can seek to persuade and have their points of view noted, but coercion is not the right way to describe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me draw to the Minister's attention new clause 50, which compels school governing bodies to consider the opt-out ballot. Is not that coercion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have conceded already that that is similar to companies law and to the way in which this House, by its procedures, is coerced, forced or compelled to consider matters on a regular or annual basis. If the hon. Gentleman continues to ask the questions, I shall probably keep giving him the same answer, but that will not get us very far and I am conscious of the need to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport asked the interesting question of who sets the agenda in our schools. I can tell him who does not—the Labour party, because it has no policies on education. I can tell him who would like to—the National Union of Teachers, which spends most of its time trying to set the agenda in schools in the most negative way. I shall leave it to Opposition Members to decide whether it does that by coercion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister persuade the Minister for Energy to repay to the Government the money that he wasted from the education fund in slandering the NUT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter has been examined thoroughly by the appropriate bodies and dealt with satisfactorily.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1505</span>
Opposition Members may want to divert themselves into such matters, but they shall not drag me along with them. The matter has been disposed of in the usual way and need not detain the Committee further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the question of who sets the agenda in schools is governors and parents. Those are the people whom we are allowing, rightly, to guide the education process. A question was asked about sanctions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the Minister says about sanctions, because he has just contradicted the purpose of the new clause. If parents and governors determine the agenda in schools, why must the Government prescribe the items that the governors discuss at their meetings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is two different agendas. We are telling governing bodies what should be on their agendas so that they can determine the agendas for their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was the hon. Member for Wallsend who asked—I could be wrong because Opposition Members often blur into each other at this time of the day—about the available sanctions if a governing body failed to comply with the requirements of the new clause. Failure to comply with the duty laid down in the new clause would enable the Secretary of State to intervene under section 99(1) of the Education Act 1944. I know that that will have the full support of Opposition Members because it is in the 1944 Act. The Secretary of State would be able to direct the governing body to comply with its statutory duty under the new clause and, if they refuse, the Secretary of State could apply to the courts to require the governing body to comply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if they did not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they did not comply, they would be in contempt of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members really believe that governing bodies would take matters that far, it shows the extent to which lawlessness has grabbed the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reference to my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend reminds me of a question that I wished to ask about the second line of the new clause. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide for this section to apply, in relation to such areas as may be specified". What does that mean? I feared that the Minister would sit down before he tackled that question.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman should be fair. I was just getting into my stride. The Committee has heard only my opening remarks. There is more good stuff to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, even at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Governors throughout the country would like the matter to be clarified. The Minister claims that if the governing body does not place grant-maintained status on the agenda, the ultimate sanction will be an application to a court to place an order on the governing body. If the governing body refuses to comply, it can be accused of contempt of court. I believed—I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will leap to his feet to confirm it—that the ultimate sanction of the courts was imprisonment. Can governors be put in prison if they do not place grant-maintained status on their agendas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1506</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always prepared to be guided by the hon. Member for Wallsend, or my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. It would be up to the court to determine an appropriate sanction if it judged a governing body to be in contempt of court. I do not wish to pre-empt a court's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend raised an important issue. I shall explain the prosaic reality behind the problem that has intrigued the Opposition. The new clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to such areas as may be specified",</p></blockquote>
because it is appropriate to acknowledge the different circumstances that exist in Wales. We have made many distinctions between England and Wales. For example, there will be a funding agency for England, and there may be one for Wales—that is up to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may wish to make provisions for England under the new clause, but he is more than content for the Secretary of State for Wales to decide whether or when similar provisions should be made in the Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I pushed the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that the hon. Member for Bridgend would be happy with my reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like further clarification on that point. As the courts have recently decided that what is said in Committee or in the Chamber may be used in a dispute, it is important that what the Minister says is clear. The funding agency will be introduced in England when the Secretary of State decides that it is appropriate to do so. It will apply to the whole of England; it will not differentiate between local authority areas. As the Secretary of State will have the power to introduce the funding council by order when he deems it appropriate, the new clause, refers only to a straight division between England and Wales. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to fetter my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It is possible that he may wish to differentiate between areas in England. However, I envisage the provision applying to the whole of England because I cannot imagine why there is a need to distinguish between areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on important ground. The idea that different rules may apply in Kent or in North Yorkshire or in, dare I say, East Sussex is interesting, but it is not just a question of geographical areas. A distinction could be made between sectors. Is the Minister saying that the provision could be introduced for primary school governors, but not those of secondary schools, or for those of secondary schools but not those of primary schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Opposition Members are going down a blind alley. That is not the case, nor is it the provision of the new clause. Although it seems to be possible under the terms of the new clause that a distinction by geographical area could be made, such an occurrence would be extremely unlikely. It is not the Secretary of State's current intention and it would not be done in such a fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister conceed that the wording of the new clause suggests that the Secretary of State will have the power to pick between LEAs in England? That may not be the intention, but he may decide that Kent, which has 70 per cent. grant-maintained schools, should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1507</span>
treated differently than East Sussex, where no schools are grant-maintained. If we vote for the new clause, we shall give the Secretary of State that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I concede that that would be the case, but for Peper 	<i>v.</i> Hart purposes, I should make it clear that it is not the Secretary of State's current intention. I do not envisage it so being, but, yes, the way that the new clause is drafted means that it would be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am waiting to see whether the Minister is about to finish. If so, I shall defer suspension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To help you and the Committee, Sir John, I shall say that I hope that I have said enough to encourage the Committee to vote in favour of the new clause and that I have answered the Committee's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You see my trouble, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall suspend the sitting for an hour and a half with an additional 20 minutes for any Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the Minister is keen to wind up our debate and that it is in the Government's best interests to do so. However, I have a straightforward question for him. How many submissions have the Government received, since publication of the White paper, in support of new clause 50, which compels school governing bodies to consider annually whether to ballot parents on the question of opting out? If the Minister's answer is none, his defence will have been heroic, like Napoleon's at Waterloo, but his argument will have been blown apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may surprise the hon. Gentleman—I shall let him into a tiny trade secret—that the Bill has not been constructed in every detail on the basis of responses to the White Paper. It goes without saying that we took careful note of the responses that we received, but the Bill was not based on them. We have listened to debates in Committee, and we have accepted some Opposition amendments. We have also listened to people outside the Committee and the House, even during our proceedings. Many people will testify to the fact that we have been open to discussions and that Ministers of State, Secretaries of State and I have listened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many submissions have been received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the answer is, very few, but Opposition Members must understand that legislation cannot always be based on the number of people who respond to consultations and it would be odd if it were thus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether the paucity of representations on the White Paper was because the Government chose to publish it at the end of July and wanted responses by September, when most schools were
	<span class='label label-info column'>1508</span>
on holiday and Parliament was in recess, or whether the Government's decision to press ahead, regardless of the lack of representations, is just another illustration of the fact that they are not interested in consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth is that we consult to death. I have never known a Department to consult so frequently on so many subjects and so assiduously—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a fault.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, to a fault, as my hon. Friend reminds me. I am glad that he is now in the Committee to prompt me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to wind up this part of our debate by referring to an accusation made by the hon. Member for Dewsbury, who said that the new clause was an attempt by the Government to seize power. The opposite is the case. It is stating the obvious to say that any Government have power and that they do not need to accrue it. That is how our democratic system works. The Bill concerns the empowerment of schools and governing bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I vowed that I would not intervene again because I thought that the Minister would conclude. However, I have to say that new clause 50 does not concern empowerment; it concerns the Government dictating to school governing bodies what they will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it simply assists governing bodies to discharge their responsibility to parents and pupils and guides them in how best to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What new powers does new clause 50 give to governing bodies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill empowers governing bodies and schools. The bodies which are trying desperately to hold on to power are the LEAs, which are—I think unnecessarily—afraid of the results of balloting and of schools deciding to opt for grant-maintained status. We must put the issue into perspective. We are trying to arrange for powers to be transferred, if that is what parents want, from LEAs to grant-maintained schools. Therefore, I must refute the hon. Lady's implication or accusation that the Bill represents a Government grab for power. The Bill represents, always has done, and always will do the opposite. If we were allowed to spend another 150 hours in Committee, I doubt that I should be able to get my message across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tempt my hon. Friend to respond to my earlier intervention when I said that we should be considering whether new clause 50 goes far enough towards ensuring that the parents to whom the choice is being given are made aware of the routes to that choice? If all the emphasis is on the route through the governing body and the decision by that body to hold a ballot, parents may not appreciate that there is another route—that they can petition the governing body. I would ask my hon. Friend to keep in mind, not necessarily for the Bill but perhaps for a later stage, the possibility of requiring that that parents' right is drawn to their attention in the annual report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting suggestion, although it is probably not appropriate for us to pursue it at this stage. As more schools choose grant-maintained status and the process attracts publicity—regrettably not always of the best kind, but let us imagine that it is—and as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1509</span>
parents and governors who are interested in the possibility of grant-maintained status find that they can visit a school nearby and learn what grant-maintained status means, it is distinctly possible that the awareness about which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea spoke will grow. That seems to strike irrational fear into LEAs. As they witness the growth and development of the process, they seem to be becoming paranoid about and afraid of the results. They should not be—the best LEAs should be encouraging the process as we have helped them to do through local management of schools, a process which began several years ago and which is now widely acknowledged by the best LEAs and by all the schools that have enjoyed it as an unalloyed success. Those are examples of what empowerment of schools means on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that we have had a thorough debate on this important new clause and I hope that I have answered all the questions asked by hon. Members.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>COMPLAINTS AND ENFORCEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'(1) A funding authority shall, with the approval of the Secretary of State and after consultation with governing bodies of grant-maintained schools and local education authorities, make arrangements for the consideration and disposal of any complaint made after the date of the establishment of the authority which is to the effect that the authority—
	<ol>

	<li>have failed to discharge any duty imposed on them.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(2) The Secretary of State shall not entertain under section 68 or 99 of the 1944 Act any complaint falling within subsection (1) above, unless a complaint concerning the same matter has been made and disposed of in accordance with arrangements made under that subsection.'.—	<i>[Mr. Win Griffiths.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to provide for the grant-maintained sector a similar procedure for dealing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1510</span>
with complaints as that for LEA schools, which is set out in section 23 of the Education Reform Act 1988. Section 58(5)(e) of that Act provides for handling complaints in grant-maintained schools. However, neither section 58 nor paragraph 7 of schedule 6, which also deals with handling complaints in grant-maintained schools, provides for a specific complaints procedure in the way that section 23 provides for one in LEA schools. The new clause is based on those section 23 responsibilities and has been drafted to ensure that it complies with the provisions for complaints and redress in the citizens charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the complaints procedure in grant-maintained schools will be open and accessible and that information will be readily available on how to complain. We want to establish a code of practice for handling complaints, to ensure that tight targets are set for dealing with them and to provide clear information about further procedures, to any complainant who is dissatisfied. It is especially important that a similar complaints procedure should be established in GM schools because the Government believe that that sector will grow. Therefore, even if the Government cannot accept the new clause as drafted, they should accept the principle behind it and introduce a similar one on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the new clause is unnecessary and that the approach that has been adopted in it is wrong for two reasons. First, GM schools, with their new independence and accountability in respect of the format and basis on which their governing bodies operate, will have the degree of direct accountability that we would expect of them. Correspondingly, the role of the funding agency for schools is not necessarily as the hon. Member for Bridgend suggests. It seems like a long time ago, but I suppose that it was only a few weeks ago in our proceedings, that we stressed, over and over, that the funding agency for schools would be—to use the expression in vogue at the time—as light touch a body as possible, that it would principally be a mechanism for paying the moneys and grants to GM schools based on formulae agreed to and set out by the Secretary of State and that it would not necessarily have the degree of involvement in functions that would naturally lend itself to being a source of complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason concerns our old friend the non-departmental public body guide. It is good to see it back again. At one stage in our proceedings it was on everyone's lips as all members of the Committee seemed to have read it and to have committed it to memory. I am tempted to set a small test for members of the Committee to see how much of the guide's contents they can remember. I shall not embarrass anyone, least of all myself, by so doing.

When we come to set up the funding agency and to define more closely its role and responsibilities—even more closely than that is defined already on the face of the Bill—we shall take as one of our main guidance documents the NDPB guide, which will instruct us, probably under the aegis of the management plan, to set up appropriate mechanisms, to allow for representations to be made to the funding agency or for it to deal with complaints. I am sure that that is the correct way to proceed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely because that assumes that the relationship between GM schools and the funding agency for schools will be analogous to or the same as the relationship between county or maintained schools and the LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 6(3), sections 68 and 99 of the Education Act 1944 place the funding agency in the same relationship with the Secretary of State for Education as LEAs when dealing with certain complaints. If that relationship is the same, why cannot it follow through into the school sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the relationship is at all the same. I am trying to establish that, if one examines the nature of GM schools on the one hand and LEA schools on the other, even with local management of schools; if one examines the role of LEAs as they will continue after the Bill is enacted, when every school has gone grant-maintained and the LEAs continue to have the role that we referred to earlier; and if one considers, the constitutional position of the funding agency for schools as a non-departmental public body, the similarity or parallel is insufficient in all those respects to draw the analogy that the hon. Gentleman wants to draw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be better if we proceeded along the lines that I suggested, took what is in the Bill as the overall framework of operation for the funding agency for schools, added what is in the NDPB guide and built on that under the rubric of the management plan. That would enable us to arrive at a workable answer to the need, if one arises, for a redress or complaints mechanism. That is the way forward.

The new clause explores the issue of consultation with students. In recent years, we have seen a move to recognise that we need to listen to children. That is now acknowledged as the correct thing to do in all stages of family proceedings. Indeed, the Children Act 1989 emphasies the need to lisen to children. I welcome that development. We could cite many recent examples that have been in the news in which, had children been listened to, things might not have turned out as they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children's views on education matters need to be listend to wherever appropriate and in accordance with the age and experiences of the child. The statementing process consults everyone—the parents, the psychologists, the teachers and all those involved with the child—except the child whose education is being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many schools have developed good processes, such as school councils or tutorial sessions, whereby students are encouraged to express a view about their education and to become active students. That is similar to the concept of active citizenship. No matter what term is used, the consultation is supported by both the major parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is an attempt to encourage schools to acknowledge that one of the most imortant partners in the process of education, together with parents and teachers, are children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Does she agree with me and the Minister, who spoke about this earlier, that it is important for 15-year-olds to have rational and informative information about the choices available to them? Would she also agree that the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, which the Government say they support and which we support, promotes the idea that children should be consulted and brought into the process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that, throughout the world, legislation is being introduced that highlights the importance of children expressing an opinion. My hon. Friend gave a good example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I firmly believe that the people who have responsibility for managing the schools—the heads and the governors—have the final say in any decision on the management of the school. But in order to develop good active citizens who take a full part in our democratic society, we should take every opportunity to encourage students to play a part commensurate with their age and experience and to express views about their education and their schools. The school community is important to them while they are of compulsory school age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

She said that the head and the governing body should have the final say, but what does "due consideration" mean? Can she give us some examples?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Moms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each school has its own practice depending on its ethos and its tradition of consulting students. The school council is one way in which students are encouraged to be active members of their school community, to learn how to behave at meetings, to express views, and to learn to take into account other people's point of view without screaming at each other, as we often do. It is a good learning process. A Bill is not the place to set down the way in which the student body should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the interesting aspects of student consultations is the varied way in which they have taken place. The new clause is written in vague terms because we want schools to decide the best way in which that consultation and that listening process should take place. It is a listening process as much as a consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One way in which the new clause could be implemented would be to allow the head boy and the head girl of the school to be participating members of the governing body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That certainly occurred in the school in which I taught until legislation made it impossible. My hon. Friend has shown the variety of ways in which schools can acknowledge the fact that students are an important part of the school community. Their voices should be heard, and we should encourage people to listen to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Lady with care and interest. However, I am not clear about where the balance should lie. There is a great danger of going from common sense to the dotty. The clause probably encompasses both of those attributes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop my argument a little and then I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed on many occasions the best interests of children at school and how their views and wishes can be taken into account. The clause acknowledges that a pupil's ability to express his views will vary according to his age and experience. When we discussed special educational needs, I said that children should feel comfortable with their education, the learning environment and the teaching aids that are available to them. The pupil needs to be consulted and his views taken on board. In most schools that should happen, and if it does not, there are appropriate channels for parents to appeal on behalf of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the mainstream schools, it often makes sense and is right that pupils should be consulted about decisions that affect them. Those pupils are young people who are moving towards adult-hood, student-hood and post-school life. As sixth form colleges and FE colleges move into the outside world in the corporate sense, the age at which the student-cum-pupil is able to have a bigger say has fallen. It is right that the student should be consulted when subjects and careers are being considered. All that is common sense, and I have no qualms about it, although I am not sure whether it needs to be put into legislation, as it seems to me to be only good practice in both teaching and school management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 7 goes beyond that. It refers to provisions being made
	<br><blockquote><p>"where practicable to ascertain and to give due consideration to the views of pupils".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1514</span>
I asked the hon. Member for Yardley for examples of what that meant. I am not sure whether I heard any, although the hon. Lady is probably right to say that such things cannot be described in law. But if that is so, should such requirements be put in law at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have not been able to hear examples in this Committee of how such a provision would operate, will there not be problems in the use of legal jargon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. New clause 7 would put a little flesh on the recommendation in the Elton report on discipline about the various ways in which a pupil or student is made part of the school community and not alienated from the school and the process of education. The new clause may not be the best method of achieving that, but it is an appropriate hook on which to hang a debate about the way in which the Government intend to implement that recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain about the hon. Gentleman's use of words. To put flesh on discipline sounds rather painful. However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and the spirit in which it was offered, which reflects the spirit behind the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the new clause verges on the dotty—and where it causes me problems—is where it refers to provisions to ensure that
	<br><blockquote><p>"proper consideration is given to the views of the pupil body as to matters affecting them in the running of the school".</p></blockquote>
What matters are those? Matters that affect the pupil body go beyond the good discipline of the school in the broadest sense. They may include the maintenance of the school grounds, or the school's specific regime of discipline and punishment. Perhaps the hon. Member for Yardley would say that such matters are more for the school as an authority than for the pupils, but my biggest worry is with new clause 7(2)(b), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"before making any decision affecting an individual pupil, the views of that pupil about the decision shall be ascertained".</p></blockquote>
The new clause contains no "ifs", "buts" or "maybes", nor any phrase such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"wherever possible the child's views should be taken into account".</p></blockquote>
The words "any decision" would mean that a child would have to be consulted about decisions affecting his or her discipline and about the setting of homework or timetables, for example, to be sure that they were suitable. I am not sure how that would conflict with the interests of the curriculum—either the national curriculum or that of the specific school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yardley will probably know where my point is leading. The new clause will lead to a gridlock in the management of schools. One cannot have a school in which every decision affecting each child has to be considered by that child, although, having regard to age and understanding, children aged three, four, five or six should be able to toddle into whichever study the decision will be made and be asked, "Right, Fred, now what do you think?" That situation drifts into the absurd. I do not think that that is the intention of the hon. Lady, but it is the implication of the new clause. As has been said, it is a vehicle for debate, to discuss the way in which the child's interests can be better taken into account in future. It should not be included in the Bill or in school rule books.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said this before and I shall be happy to repeat it, but my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has analysed it most beautifully and put his finger on it.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1515</span>
I was going to use not the word, "dotty", but the word, "politically correct" because we are into the area of political correctness in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Warrington, South. I was also concerned with the detailed provisions of the new clause because it refers to all schools. By that, we infer that it refers to both primary and secondary schools. That gives rise immediately to a problem. It seems that we must call all young people at schools, "students". 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, but the hon. Member for Yardley said, "consultation with students"—those were her words because I made a note of them. That is the flavour of what we are getting into—the idea that young people at school, or whatever age, have a right to be consulted in the way that my hon. Friend so aptly described, especially under paragraph (2)(b) of the new clause. That would take us too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody is denying that it is sensible educational practice to be aware of the needs and desires of youngsters at school. Circular 22/89, which we issued jointly with our colleagues at the Department of Health, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The feelings and perceptions of the child concerned should be taken into account, and older children and young persons should be able to share in discussions on their needs and any proposed provision."</p></blockquote>
That is a much more rounded approach to the problem and captures its flavour in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea would find workable and acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is too all-embracing and tries to go too far. It attempts to include all age groups of pupils in schools, which is not only too ambitious, but, in many circumstances, would be absurd and unworkable. I also think that it would put teachers and heads in a difficult position, in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However good the motivation behind it, the new clause is wrongly drafted and would go too far. I recommend to the Committee that we have a combination of the circular that I have just quoted and the code of practice to which I alluded in our earlier deliberations. No doubt, it will have something to say on the role of children in the determination of the establishment of the status of special educational needs. There are other mechanisms and vehicles under which we can bring that consideration into play. However, the new clause is over prescriptive and far too wide-ranging. For that reason, I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "students" that I used demonstrates my background in sixth-form education in a comprehensive school.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, they do. I was trying to use one word instead of two, but when the Minister read out his directive he used the term "pupils and young people." I merely used the terms pupils and students and that is not an issue that we should make much of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his comments. I listened to them with care and there was not much with which I disagreed. He showed a willingness to accept that it is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1516</span>
important educational principle to listen to students when appropriate. At most ages, children are able to make decisions about some things. It is important that we recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take into account what has been said about the interpretation of the new clause. It has been an important debate. We have spent a long time discussing those involved in the education process—governors, teachers and parents. In the dying hours of the Committee, we have recognised that pupils, students and young people have their part to play in expressing an opinion about a community that is important to them and about a process that will be influential on their lives.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our brief stand-part debate on clause 157 encouraged me to table the new clause. In that debate, the government recognised the importance of minimising the legalistic approach that the tribunals would inevitably encourage over time. There should be scope for conciliation or arbitration procedure between the failure of a parent and a LEA to agree on a statement for a child and the appeal to a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good reasons to provide such scope. The tribunals will tend to become legalistic, and solicitors, and possibly Queen's Counsels, will attend to represent the different parties. Therefore, we wish to minimise appeals to the tribunal. In addition, we must consider what is happening to legal aid. Recourse to legal aid will be much diminished and an appearance before a tribunal would not qualify for legal aid. Legal aid would be available only in the preparation of a case and if the person appealing to the tribunal were eligible to receive it. The chances are that most people would not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to avoid people getting involved in the tribunal process. That would signal a failure in the other provisions of the Bill. Further to that, there is a cost implication. I mentioned on a point of order this morning that earlier in our debates the Government view, given on 28 January at column 1181, was that it would cost about £1 million a year to set up the tribunal system. We do not know exactly how those estimates were reached. They could not have been based upon the current cost of appeals procedures in local authorities, because I was told, in reply to a parliamentary question, that that information is not held. Therefore, I am anxious to make sure that the extra expense of going to a tribunal is avoided and that the costs are kept below the £1 million estimate. The introduction of a conciliation procedure would be a useful way to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1517</span>
A difficulty could also arise because of delay in handling appeals in the tribunal. In the earlier debate, I referred to the fact that the social security tribunal system involved, quite commonly, delays of anything between three and six months, depending on the type of case being handled. It was pointed out in defence that that system involves a two-tier procedure, which perhaps contributed to the delay, and that under the proecudure that we are discussing there would be a one-stop tribunal. Nevertheless, parents' appeals to the tribunal could increase considerably. At the moment, 120 judicial review applications are proceeding. Many experts believe that that is just the tip of the iceberg. There must then be every possibility that the tribunal system could become clogged. Therefore, we are most anxious that conciliation between the LEA and the parents should be possible, to avoid going to the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to lengthen the procedure inordinately, the new clause specifies that it should take no more than 28 days. It refers also to a conciliator with whom the LEA and the parents must be prepared to agree. There could be failure to agree over a conciliator, in which case the appeal would go straight to the tribunal. If agreement on a conciliator were possible, and if there were no agreement within 28 days once the conciliator had considered the case, it would then go to the tribunal. However, I hope that such modest effort to reduce the amount of work going to the tribunal, involving a delay of only a month, would be useful in preventing the clogging up of the tribunal system, particularly as the Government reckon that it will cost only £1 million a year to run it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of seeking to prevent the tribunal system's becoming a significant part of the statementing process, I appeal to the Government—even if they do not consider the wording of the clause to be suitable, a point that, I would quite understand—at least to accept the principle of inserting a conciliation procedure between the parents' dissatisfaction with the statement and the appeal to the tribunal. We should then be able to close the Committee on a very happy note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bridgend has such a reasonable manner and makes things sound so attractive that it is difficult to deny him. But deny him I must on this occasion, and for practical reasons. I believe that Opposition Members are prejudging rather harshly the effectiveness and efficacy of the tribunal system over which we have gone to such pains. They are making the mistake of judging the system before we have even set it up and discounting the lengths to which we will go to make it as approachable and informal as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason that we believe that the tribunal will be such an effective instrument in delivering better statementing of children with special educational needs is its one-stage feature. The new clause would reintroduce a two-stage procedure which has bedevilled existing procedures for some 10 years. The fact that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to limit the length of the proposed new stage to 28 days would probably mean that the procedure could not be effective. It is extremely doubtful that the sort of procedures involved in providing and identifying a statement for a child with special educational needs could be conciliated within a 28-day period, given the wealth of evidence that must be brought to bear and the strength of feeling that exists. To impose a time limit of 28 days for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave—to try to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1518</span>
that the process is not lengthened—would unduly inhibit this important new stage in the process to such an extent that it would be vitiated. I believe that such a time limit would be overly restrictive. I would rather keep what we have argued for throughout the Committee's proceedings. I believe that a one-stage tribunal, which has the power of binding decision and provides balanced representation and all the other features that we described in a previous sitting, is the right way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the motivation of the hon. Member for Bridgend. To introduce another element, however, would be bad enough; to introduce a time limit so that the procedure would not be lengthened would undermine its effectiveness. All in all, I strongly suspect that the new clause would not have the beneficial effect that the hon. Gentleman has ascribed to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would do better to keep the tribunal system as proposed. We will develop it to be as user friendly as possible and try to ensure that it will make a real contribution to the speedy and effective provision of statements for children with special educational needs.

I feel that I have drawn the short-straw in having been called to move a new clause at this stage of the proceedings, especially as there are parts of the new clause with which I disagree. Conservative Members may think that parts of it are badly worded and would make poor law, and they would not be far wrong. In that respect, of course, the new clause would fit in well with the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss some of the positive aspects in the new clause. It would put some of the Elton report's recommendations into the Bill. We could agree that paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and the first part of (d) and (f) of subsection (2) are best practice and that what they would provide happens in most schools. The new clause seeks to improve section 22 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 which referred to children having a proper regard for authority. In some cases, that authority can be abused and wrongful. The clause would establish good order for schools and regard for others.

Subsection 2(d) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"sanctions should not be cruel"</p></blockquote>
and humiliating. It would include articles 28 and 19 of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, and article 3 of the European convention on human rights into the Bill. We would all welcome that, but there are problems. Paragraph (d) states that sanctions should not be
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to inhibit or jeopardise pupils' education".</p></blockquote>
That could be taken to mean that no child could be excluded from school—or be asked to leave a classroom—under any circumstances. Paragraph (e) could be taken to mean that there would be no provision for classrom detention, which would be foolish. We could agree on paragraph (f), which is about bullying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is probing. I hope that the Minister accepts that we need a legislative framework in which schools can examine their discipline policies. I accept that the new clause would not provide the correct framework, but I would be interested to hear the Minister's view. He may discuss on the Floor of the House ideas about the kind of legislative framework that we need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope), particularly as my constituent Katharine Bamber unfortunately committed suicide a year ago at a school, leaving a note alleging bullying as one of the reasons for her death. I am pleased that the Government have commissioned a report from Sheffield university about bullying. Paragraph (f) of the new clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"allegations of bullying should always be investigated with a view to taking any necessary action to prevent further bullying."</p></blockquote>
I take issue with the hon. Gentleman for saying that that already happens. Sadly, in my experience, too many schools do not take sufficient notice or have a coherent anti-bullying policy to establish an ethos so that those who feel that they have been bullied can go to someone in authority and be dealt with in a sensitive rather than confrontational way. Confrontation often makes situations worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say how the research project is progressing? It was expected to emerge in February or
	<span class='label label-info column'>1520</span>
March. How do the Government propose to react to it? I endorse what the hon. Gentleman said; we do not need the new clause as a legislative framework for examining schools' policy on behaviour because, such a policy ought to develop through good practice and should allow head teachers and governing bodies maximum flexibility. Nevertheless, this matter is too important to be left for individual schools to decide. A code of practice comprising best practice should be laid down by the DFE for schools throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hyndburn for the spirit and manner in which he tabled the new clause. However, what he has said highlights a difficulty. To include the new clause in the Bill would effect an intention that we all support. However, the Bill must be workable and sensible; it must not tie the hands of head teachers, who are mainly responsible for discipline and exclusions. I am reluctant to include so much detail in the Bill. We have just completed our consultation on exclusions. If we conclude that legislation is appropriate, we have time to present it in another place. I expect the result of the research project on bullying in the autumn and I shall examine that carefully. It would be inappropriate to impose on head teachers the directions or constraints that the new clause proposes. If we decide that we should include more detail about exclusions in the Bill, we shall present an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Committee will end on a note of agreement. The new clause is self-explanatory; it would end corporal punishment in all schools. Corporal punishment was abandoned in state schools without ill effect some years ago, and most independent schools have also abandoned it, after taking account of the views of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1521</span>
parents and society. The hon. Members for Hastings and Rye and for Erewash made sensitive comments about the needs of children in special schools, but it is interesting to note that corporal punishment is permitted by law in private special schools. This simple new clause would remove an archaic anomaly in the law and ensure equal, decent treatment for all children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity to finish our proceedings on a disappointing note, however, I must stand firm in favour of a principle that Conservative Members have always accepted. Parents who have the freedom to choose the schools to which they send their children, and are able to establish the school's policy, should make a choice about corporal punishment. It would be wrong to inhibit or restrict choice in the way suggested by the new clause. Current law contains ample protection. Parents must be able to continue to choose, and to look to the welfare of their children. Regrettably, I ask the Committee to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply disappointed by the Minister's response.

the required number of parent governors shall be made up by persons appointed by the other members of the governing body.</li>
	<li>The instrument shall require governors, in appointing a person under a provision made by virtue of sub-paragraph (5) above—</li>

	<p>	<i>Transitory provisions</i></p>
	<p>13. Regulations may modify the provisions of paragraphs 5 to 12 above in relation to—
	<ol>

The Committee's happy atmosphere has been due, in no small way, to your leadership
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Clerk for his excellent work in guiding you, Sir John, your co-Chairmen and members of the Committee through occasionally very complicated proceedings. My thanks also to 	<i>Hansard</i> which has, as ever, kept up with our meanderings in its usual immaculate way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must add my thanks to the officials from my Department who always remain nameless, if not quite faceless. They have done a magnificent job not just in helping me, but in answering the questions of other members of the Committee. We have not always been able to answer such questions spontaneously, but I hope that we have managed to come up with a satisfactory answer each time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) who served briefly, but with distinction, in his capacity as Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education, my hon.

I must mention the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) for his pre-prandial contributions, the hon. Member for Hemsworth, whom I should describe as eternally Virgilant, my hon.

Friend the Member for Battersea, whom I can describe only as a caring pillar box—only members of the Committee will ever understand that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. On behalf of Opposition Members, I add my thanks to you, to Mr. Martin and to Mrs. Winterton. Opposition Members owe a particular debt to the Clerk because we must get our amendments in order without the help of an array of civil servants. We are grateful for the help that we have received, and for the patience of 	<i>Hansard,</i> which has had to struggle with Yorkshire pronunciations and place names, but has managed to get them all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this has been a lengthy and successful Committee. I hate to end on a note of disagreement, but I do not think that it has been particularly lengthy, considering the scope of the Bill, or particularly successful, except that we have got through it.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1526</span>
I recall the Minister saying a few weeks ago that time passes quickly when one is having fun. Perhaps that is why the Committee has not seemed to be as lengthy as he suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some memorable moments, certainly for Opposition Members. At least two of my hon. Friends, including the Opposition Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) have had birthdays and we have been allowed some celebrations. My hon. Friend the Member for Yardley broke her arm and it has healed again. I think that that shows that she has fast healing bones and not that the Committee has lasted a long time. If it had lasted much longer, the national health service would have been abolished had Conservative Members had their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has sometimes been entertaining and perhaps never more so than tonight when the Minister told us that the Government consulted "to death"—a phrase that we shall remember for a long time. Opposition Members have had the entertainment of seeing the Minister's shirts, ties and handkerchiefs, all of which have given us different messages. I believe that that was a tactic to create chaos and confusion, words which prevailed throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some interesting debates and we are pleased to have been able to raise some serious issues, including matters such as the national curriculum and the problems that will arise from the centralisation that the Bill introduces. This is not the end of the Bill and we look forward to raising such issues again on the Floor of the House and to our colleagues raising them in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thank you, Sir John, for your guiding hand. Opposition Members have had a useful, productive and, for the most part, enjoyable experience. I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth if he wanted the last word. He told me to tell the Minister, "capax imperii nisi imperasset". Those words need no interpretation by Opposition Members and Conservative Members can look them up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the whole the Committee has been good natured and constructive and I thank all members of the Committee for their co-operation. I have enjoyed the past few weeks, although I am not entirely sorry that they are over. With that, I thank the Committee for its thanks and I was especially pleased to hear the tribute to the Clerk who has helped me immensely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
