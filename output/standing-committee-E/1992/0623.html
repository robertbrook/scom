	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Community Care (Residential Accommodation) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tim Yeo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I give notice that tomorrow I shall table a new sittings motion to provide for morning and afternoon sittings of the Committee from this Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may either move that now or give notice. However, if he gives notice, the motion will take effect not on Thursday but on Tuesday next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Bar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. The Minister has given notice that he would like the Committee to sit also in the afternoons. I hope that arrangements can be made to avoid that. If the Minister were able to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), who has just left the Committee, that the Government will find time to discuss this important Bill for a day on Report, either before or after the summer recess—and in some ways it would bebetter to discuss it after the recess—there is no reason why the Committee should prolong its consideration of the Bill into Thursday afternoon. I am happy to meet next Tuesday morning and afternoon, but, to be frank, I suspect that I shall be here alone. I think that we shall have finished the Bill by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, 	<b>Mr. McWilliam.</b> In view of your guidance, I should like to move—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was wrong. If the Minister gives notice now, he may move a sittings motion on Thursday morning and the Committee may sit on Thursday afternoon. We are not infallible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has completely cut the ground from underneath me. I shall await the outcome of the discussions that are taking place. However, the Opposition believe that it is unnecessary to prolong the sittings of the Committee in the way that the Minister suggested. I hope that an accommodation can be reached. I do not wish to prolong debate on the sittings motion because I want to table a motion myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, we shall move on to amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. May I suggest that sittings of the Committee are suspended to give the Government time to get their act together and make a statement on their proposals for community care? The Bill specifically relates to the changes that are due to take place in April 1993. But for those changes, the Bill would be unnecessary. If those changes are not to go ahead, we are wasting our time. You, Mr. McWilliam, are wasting your time, the Clerk is wasting his time and all the well-qualified civil servants in Committee are wasting their time,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
which would be better spent helping the Government to get their act together in order to implement the community care plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is in no way vexatious. Since the general election, there have been rumours in the press that the Government have been seeking ways to abort the changes that are planned for April 1993. We know that the Government did not want to give a leading role to local government, as Sir Roy Griffiths recommended and that they gave it reluctantly. On 18 July 1990 a statement in the House suspended the community care plans until next year. The reason given in July 1990 was the onset of the poll tax, euphemistically known to Ministers as the community charge. We were told that it would distort local government expenditure in 1991 and create a real problem. History is repeating itself. It is now June 1992. Next April, the council tax will replace the poll tax. Mega-billions of pounds—at least £2 billion—will be transferred from central to local government expenditure, with the onset of a new tax and an underfunded system. Local authorities will seek to make up the underfunding as best they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason for a statement of the Government's intentions. I refer not only to the rumours that the Prime Minister has called for a report from Ministers on what is due to happen next April. Apart from the start of the council tax next April, the shire county elections will take place next May, involving the very social service authorities which are due to implement this measure. I know that the Government do not mind running away from matters. They ran away in 1990 and, by heaven, they will run away next year if they can delay the implementation of this change so that it does not happen when the council tax is introduced and the shire county elections are also taking place. At least there were no shire county elections two years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other factors. The Government are clearly displeased with some of the the community care plans of local authorities. The private sector is worried sick because it has realised, belatedly, that the industry has been effectively nationalised by the community care proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us that the Prime Minister has not called for a review and that his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health is not having problems getting the funds ring-fenced in her battle with the Department of the Environment? The Government were asked on Second Reading and at our first sitting to make a firm commitment that they intend to implement the measure in April 1993, as planned. If the Minister can let us have that assurance, I shall sit down immediately, but I suspect that he will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It looks as though the Government are running away. That being so, I want to propose a motion to adjourn so that we can at least send for a law officer to advise the Committee on whether we are wasting our time considering this very short Bill. It is important in its context, but it will not have a context if the Government do not implement their community care plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could quote chapter and verse to the Committee, but I do not want to go into great detail. However, if you accepted a motion to adjourn the Committee, Mr. McWilliam, I could give substantive reasons why we should do so during the debate on that motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The duty of the Committee is to proceed with consideration of the Bill as it stands and the amendments before us. I cannot impute any motives, or otherwise, to the Government or anyone else, of which they have not given notice to the Committeee. I shall not therefore be able to accept a motion to adjourn; such a motion would be dilatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr McWilliam. Is it within your competence, as Chairman of the Committee, to suspend the Committee? When I raised the matter on the Floor of the House yesterday and suggested that Madam Speaker should suspend the Committee until the Government had made a statement, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any suspension of the Committee is up to the Chairman of the Committee. The matter should not be raised on the Floor of the House." 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 22 June 1992; Volume 210, column 19.]</p></blockquote>
Madam Speaker was virtually inviting me to put the matter to you, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Madam Speaker said exactly the right thing. It is within my competence to suspend the Committee, but I am restricted by custom, factors and Standing Orders as to the ways that I may do so. Unless the Minister, who is about to rise, is prepared to move the motion for suspension and gives us good grounds for doing so, I cannot do what the hon. Gentleman suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I think that I can put the Committee's interest in the matter to rest fairly quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a motion to adjourn would be no more than an attempt to disrupt our proceedings. That would be profoundly unhelpful to the voluntary organisations for whose benefit the measure is being considered and, indeed, to the welfare of the many vulnerable people who depend on the services provided by those organisations. It would be a great pity if party politics or House of Commons games were dragged into the discussion of such an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position has been made clear on several occasions, including the Second Reading debate and last week during oral questions in the Chamber. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the comment of my hon. Friend the Minister for Health:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We set out the timetable for implementing our community care reforms in 1990. Many of them have already been achieved. We are on course to achieve the remainder by April 1993."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 June 1992; Volume 209, column 761.]</p></blockquote>
The Government's position has not changed at all since then, so I do not think that the Committee needs to waste further time on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is important to make clear that the Opposition do not intend to disrupt the Committee's proceedings or, as the Minister suggests, to play House of Commons games or politics. We have made an important contribution to the debate on these serious issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point of order is that we should be clear about the direction the Bill is taking, because it appears from reports that have been circulating for a considerable time that the legislation that we are attempting to amend—indeed, correct—may not itself be implemented on 1 April 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
Everyone is aware that the community care programme is a shambles. There are major difficulties with the algebra group—the group of officials who are dealing with the transfer to local authorities of the budget for individuals in care homes after April 1993. The whole thing smells somewhat. The Minister should give a categoric assurance here and now that after the House has risen no announcement will be made about a further delay in assessment and case management procedures and the transfer of resources from April 1993. We hear stories from very eminent sources in the care field that a dialogue is taking place in the Department of Health and other Departments with a view to deferring yet again this important legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how we can continue to debate the Bill when it appears that the major legislation on which this correcting measure is based may not be implemented in April 1993.I support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) that we should adjourn and take advice on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nobody enjoys a good story more than I do, but it is not a point for consideration by the Committee. I am not prepared to take any more points of order on this matter. If the Government are not prepared to make an announcement, we must get on with the business before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had notice that amendments Nos. 9 and 10 have been withdrawn. That means that amendment No. 14, which was grouped with them, returns to its original place in the agenda—that is, between amendments Nos. 11 and 12 and amendment No. 17. I have also had notice that amendments Nos. 22 and 35 have been withdrawn. That has no effect on the order of amendments to be considered. So if hon. Members would delete amendments Nos. 9 and 10, put amendment No. 14 between amendments Nos. 11 and 12 and amendment No. 17, and delete amendments Nos. 22 and 35, the selection of amendments will be in the order in which they ought to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROVISION OF RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATION IN PREMISES MANAGED BY VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1O) No arrangements shall be made by virtue of this section where accommodation is provided in establishments where the number of residents exceeds a limit determined by the relevant local authority.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1P) Arrangements shall be made by virtue of this section only where the organisation or other person providing accommodation provide such accommodation in social groupings of not more than 10 persons.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the size of homes. When I was a member of a health authority I faced difficulty in regulating the size of nursing homes. York health authority, of which I was a member, had a policy of an optimum maximum size for nursing homes. In practice, it was not possible to stick to that policy because beguiling arguments were made by nursing home proprietors about the benefits of enlarging homes by a small number of beds. I have not been a member of a social services committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
but I understand that the same problem occurs in relation to residential care homes and the regulatory process that social services authorities provide. When the Bill is enacted and a regulatory framework for a new class of establishment is set, I think that the same problems are likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bigger the institution, the more institutional it is. We should establish a legal framework to make homes as homely as possible. That brings us to amendment No. 12. If a home is to be homely, it must be of domestic rather than institutional proportions. Where possible, homes should have no more than 10 persons. Where it is not feasible to establish a 10-person maximum, homes should be built and managed so that the residents are in social or domestic groupings of not more than 10 persons so that they benefit from a domestic rather an institutional scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has carefully set out the details of and the thinking behind the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 11 would allow local authorities to assess the appropriate number of residents in a home. The legislation is unclear. As local authorities know the local circumstances and the purpose of the establishment involved, they are best able to judge the number of beds that should be allowed. The aims of the establishment are crucial to the size that should be acceptable to the local authority when placing an individual in an establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on the background to the anxiety about the size of homes. I started social service work in the late 1960s when Government reports recommended that new homes for the elderly should be built for a maximum of around 40, or even fewer, people. The problem is that while new local authority homes are much smaller than those that were built in the 1950s and 1960s, the explosion in the private sector market has changed matters. That must be tackled by legislation so that local authorities have clearer powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr referred to the hospital sector. In the care and nursing sectors of private provision, there are many instances of former NHS hospitals being purchased and used for the social or nursing care of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sandal Grange hospital in my constituency is an example. It was closed in the late 1970s—my grandmother nursed there and its nursing care was highly regarded—because the local authority deemed it unsuitable for the care of elderly people. After being sold, it was reopened for the private care of old people. A hospital that was deemed unsuitable for the care of elderly people is now being used to provide social and nursing care for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Victorian mansions in my constituency and across the country have been converted for use as care homes. Hotels, guest houses and bed-and-breakfast establishments on the south coast and in other coastal resorts have been converted for care use. The suitability of these premises and the number of beds that they should be allowed to have is important is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that the Committee should understand how the providers of care have changed in the past decade. Previously, individual entrepreneurs were involved, perhaps a husband and wife with a background in social or nursing care. They bought a small home, ran it as a small business and often offered a positive, homely environment. In the 1980s, corporate bodies startd to provide care.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
Major national companies now make substantial amounts of money from the provision of care in nursing homes. For example, Ladbrokes have interests in care, as do breweries such as Boddingtons and Vaux. The process has had an impact on the size of local establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures on the size of homes show that organisations such as Lodge Care plc which have a sizeable interest in care homes have disposed of smaller homes because they are less profitable. There is a trend towards the provision of care in much larger establishments. My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) mentioned nursing homes. The Bill does not deal directly with nursing homes, but the Minister will understand that we are worried about the size of the establishments that have been allowed to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said last week in Committee, the increasing amount of income support available to individuals in private nursing homes and the differential in financial support given by the DSS to people in care homes has resulted in a huge increase in the number of nursing beds provided by the private sector and in an attempt to register much larger establishments. In Hemsworth, the adjoining constituency to my own, a new private nursing home was built only a couple of years ago that provides more than 100 nursing beds. That new building was built to cater for more than 100 people. I question—as I questioned at the time of the planning application—whether that is appropriate in this day and age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in this country believed for many years throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that large establishments are not appropriate to provide institutional care for people who are elderly or disabled. However, we now allow the private sector to bring huge new establishments on stream. The one that I mentioned in Kinsley is one of the smaller ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I give an example of the problem that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) mentions? In my constituency, in an area for which planning permission is given through the Leeds development corporation, a 180-bed home has been proposed. The numbers are going up and up. The Leeds development corporation, of which I was a member at one point, wishes to develop sites on a commercial basis. The group planning the 180-bed home has responded. Numbers are mushrooming in order to maximise profits for certain people in the care business. That should be questioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I get the distinct impression that I am the only person listening to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) makes a valid point because the home that he mentioned is even bigger than the one that I mentioned. His point—about the profits that can be made in that area—is also interesting. When I commented publicly on the planning application for the home in Kinsley, a response came in a letter from the organisation making the application. I saved the letter, out of interest. It says that the size of home relates to "economies of scale"—that term is used—in larger-scale provision. That is no justification for making people who have nursing care needs live in such large establishments. The Government have allowed the market to provide what has been in the best interests of the market, not what is necessarily in the best interests of the people living in the homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is an additional problem, in that many homes depend upon DSS grants which are not sufficient to cover the costs of care? That is an ongoing problem. In some cases—I specifically have in mind a large nursing home in my area which applied for planning permission to increase the number of beds—the proprietors try to solve financial difficulties by increasing the number of beds. Often that does not solve the problem and sometimes the economies that they try to implement to ensure that the home is an ongoing financial proposition are unacceptable.

Again I think of a specific home that has a large percentage of DSS residents. To cope with increasing financial difficulties—I say that kindly; I should hesitate to allege that there was an attempt to increase profit—some of the economies of scale have involved turning off the heating for long periods, turning off the lights at 9.30 p.m. and sending residents to bed earlier. A large institution that adopts such measures can save a considerable amount of money. It is an increasing temptation. The larger the home, the larger the economies, with consequential effects upon the residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made an important observation about how the pressures of the market can have an impact on the levels of care within an establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for York served as a member of a health authority. He rightly said that the health authority is the body that registers private nursing homes. The matter requires much examination. My worry about the size of homes relates primarily to the nursing rather than to the care sector. There are some large care homes. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South said, this development—a return to large-scale institutional care—tends to be found more in the private nursing sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the fact that under this Government financial bonuses are available, through performance-related pay, to senior managers in the health service. That puts them under pressure to close and dispose of what has been deemed geriatric provision. They are under pressure to run down the extent and availability of care for the elderly. At the same time, health authorities have been able to register or not to register applications for private nursing homes. They have a vested interest in ensuring that the private nursing sector develops and expands. There seems to be no anxiety about size; the approach seems to be the larger the better, in some respects. For instance, if a health authority manager has a 120 or 160-bed development in his locality, it helps him if he can transfer people to a private care home. They then become the responsibility of the Department of Social Security and are no longer a charge on the health budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many occasions, health authorities have given a nod and a wink to the private sector that they would happily transfer people. Financial bonuses are paid to general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
managers in the health service to achieve that end. To my mind, that is not community care; it is precisely the opposite. We should not shunt people from long-term public institutional care into long-term private institutional care. We must examine these procedures, in the interests of those who are in care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has long been recognised—there were many debates in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s—that the size of an establishment has an impact upon the nature and quality of the care that it provides. I do not suggest that all bad homes are necessarily large and that all small homes are good. It does not work that way. But it is much easier to make a smaller establishment more homely so that it is more like living in the community than it is in a 120 or 160-bed establishment of the kind mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for York. Local authorities must therefore be able to ensure that the size of a home and the number of beds are consistent with the aims and objectives of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that there is great confusion about the powers of local authorities over these matters. Confusion exists especially in registered homes tribunals. Some of their rulings—I referred last week to deposit box 14 in the Library—are inconsistent on whether local authorities have the power to decree the size of an establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the case of Humphreys v. Isle of Wight Council, which has been through the courts and may go to the Court of Appeal, but I shall not comment on the rights or wrongs of the case. The case hinges on the confusion about whether a local authority has the right to determine factors concerning care in a home, over and above those defined in sections 5 and 9 of the Registered Homes Act 1984. The registered homes tribunal, to which the Humphreys—they have a care home on the Isle of Wight—appealed, determined in February 1990 that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, or power to determine a point of law. There was a judicial review in the High Court on 6 December 1991. Mr. Justice Hutchinson ruled that a local authority may impose conditions other than those in the Act. The Humphreys may appeal to the Court of Appeal on a point of law. I shall not comment on the case. My point is that there is confusion about the role of local authorities, the rights of the registered homes tribunals and what rulings may be given by local authorities on the size of establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will clarify the position and state whether the Government intend to amend the 1984 Act to clarify a matter that causes difficulties and anxiety, especially in the private sector. The Minister will be aware of our fund-raising attempts to help the Humphreys to go to appeal, because the case impinges on decisions taken by local authorities.

In amendment No. 12, the term "social groupings" is taken from the Wagner report, which was endorsed by the Government. The term was used with reference to local authority accommodation and to a move towards social groupings in larger homes. Large establishments can be made more homely if the occupants live in small groups. In 1980 I visited a home Kirklees—Longdenholme in Huddersfield. In terms of the state of the building and its size, it was one of the worst that I have been in, but the care staff had introduced group living. The 50 occupants lived in small groups of approximately 10. They looked after each

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
other and worked together and catered for themselves, wherever possible. The establishment was much more homely than other large establishments. That commendable experiment is as relevant now as it was 10 years ago when I saw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 covers good practice. I hope that the Minister will recognise that we are trying to implement some of the recommendations of the reports that were commissioned and endorsed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Tessa Jowell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to realise that any divergence from the line set out in the amendment is being taken for reasons other than the best interests of residents and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield said, would be out of line with what is broadly recognised as good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to recognise that before the recession, owners of many homes in the private sector made their money through capital appreciation of the large houses that they bought and sold. That explains why ownership of residential care homes changes, on average, every three years. That has happened more frequently, however, since the recession started to bite. The attendant disruption for residents has been well documented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem faced by homes, which will be compounded by the stories in today's newspapers about the possibility of a further delay, is the extent to which many of them have subsisted in anticipation of money being available from local authorities to meet the full cost of care in April 1993.I shall be interested to hear from the Minister whether he accepts that the shortfall between available income support and fees charged is £130 million and how that gap will be made up by local authorities after 1993, unless the Government recognise the problem in advance of responsibility being fully transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw the Committee's attention to a survey conducted by the Association of Directors of Social Services on the impact of the cash crisis on residential care and the services provided for the care of elderly people. The survey concluded that a two-tier system of care is emerging for people who can afford to pay their own fees and for those who rely upon increasingly inadequate levels of income support. The association reported that many homes are keeping their doors open only by maintaining their fees at artificially low levels, in the hope of increasing them when social service departments assume financial responsibility in April 1993. It stated that people who rely upon income support face less choice and second-class accommodation in private homes, including shared rooms without private bathrooms or toilets. Separate and additional charges are often made for services such as chiropody, special nursing during illness, medical dressings and physiotherapy, and residents whose personal allowance of £11.80 a week is taken to meet the discrepancy between income support and fees charged have no income left to cover the cost of those extra services. Further savings include staff and training cuts, reduced maintenance of buildings, reduced quality and choice of food and lower heating levels, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport referred. The survey also referred to the disturbing drift towards increasingly placing elderly people in nursing homes rather than residential care homes, not because they need the higher level of nursing care but because that is a way of maximising the income available for the care of elderly people. During the survey carried out by the Association of Directors of Social Services, one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
council discovered that 38 per cent. of nursing home residents in its area should have been in ordinary residential care homes. The president of the ADSS, Ian White, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because the government cannot tell local authorities how much cash will be made available for community care until November 1992, social services departments cannot step in and help homes which are going out of business."</p></blockquote>
One anonymous home owner in Birmingham said that she would face bankruptcy because of empty beds. She described how her accountant had recommended that she should make savings on the food bill. In conclusion, the owner of the home pointed to the unviability of homes with 15 beds, when only a few years ago a 10-bed home was barely viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unleashing market forces on residential care militates directly against the best standards of care for elderly residents. Nothing provides more compelling evidence of that than this recent survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that Opposition Members feel very strongly on this issue, especially the hon. Member for Wakefield who has raised a number of points.
I understand the concerns that have been expressed about the size of homes. I recognise that there can be some relationship between the size of a home and the quality of life of its residents, though I do not believe that the relationship is quite as direct as has been suggested. Indeed, the hon. Member for Wakefield acknowledged that it is not impossible for a large home to offer a perfectly satisfactory standard of care and that some small homes may be deficient, for other reasons. There is no direct relationship, therefore between size and quality. For that reasons, there is no consensus among general practitioners about whether an upper limit should be placed on the size of homes. The Government see no reason to prescribe in law the maximum size for a home, or to prescribed a maximum size for the social groupings to which the hon. Member for Wakefield referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Homes cater for a great variety of needs. Residents may be elderly, or have a physical or mental handicap, or have an addiction problem such as alcohol or drug abuse. For that reason, it is desirable to preserve as much flexibility as possible to meet the individual needs and wishes of residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The building notes which my Department issue suggest that local authority homes should not be too large and that social grouping should be encouraged, where appropriate. That approach is also recommended in "Home Life", the code of practice to which I have previously referred. I believe that we want a flexible policy which is user-centered and designed to meet the needs of individual users. Larger homes may be able to offer facilities and services which would not be available in smaller homes. It would be wrong to prevent local authorities from placing people in an establishment that might be regarded as good, merely because it exceeded a certain size. There is nothing to stop local authorities from refraining to place people in privately-run residential or nursing homes, if they feel that the quality of the care provided is unsatisfactory. If authorities believe that in some cases the quality is unsatisfactory because of the size of the home, they will use their judgment. However, I do not believe that it would be in the interestsof residents, or potential residents, to fetter local authorities' discretion in that way.

The hon. Member for Dulwich (Ms. Jowell) raised a number of detailed points about the transfer of local authority funds. However, I do not think that the debate on this amendment is the right place to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Community care philosophy is based on a great deal of research into the bad effects of institutionalisation on people who are placed in institutions. At what point does the Minister believe that a home becomes in institution? That is the key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, institutionalisation has always been measured in terms of numbers. All institutions have large numbers of people. That give rise to routines and controls which are bad for the individual but which are inherent when large numbers of people live in one place. At what point is the Minister willing to consider regulating homes so that they do not become institutions? He said that local authorities can judge whether homes have become institutionalised, but he has given them little regulatory authority to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to deregister homes for reasons such as quality of care. It is not possible to deregister a home if that home is assessed as having routines that institutionalise people. Local authorities do not have the power to deregister on those grounds. All that can be done is to regulate the size of homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence is clear that, beyond a certain size, homes become institutionalised. If the Minister is serious about community care, he should tackle the issue. If he does not, you will have community care equivalent to institutions in the community. That could be as bad as the institutions in the health service, as an alternative to which the community care programme was designed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not going to have community care anywhere, at least not for some years. I shall determine what is in order in this Committee. Anything that flows from the size of homes is in order in respect of these amendments. However, I must warn the Committee that the later amendments are very narrow and that members of the Committee will have to stick to them. The amendments that we are discussing are fairly broad, and no one has been out of order yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is welcome because, as we said at the start, we want to use the Bill to lay out certain points and maintain a degree of consensus. There is widespread consensus, about 80 per cent., on the forward thrust of the policy—at least, until the Government ditch the whole thing. That has been shown by the speeches of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that the test must be quality. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport said, it is difficult to test quality and use that as a means of coercing a home to change its regime or of closing it. Last year, as an ordinary private citizen, I had the duty of locating nursing home places for two dear friends. It was quite an exercise. In one case, I acted as an appointed joint receiver for the Court of Protection. One cannot go on the size of an establishment rather than quality of care, nor can one use the fact that a home has 50, 20 or 120 beds as a guide to size. It is meaningless to measure size by the number of beds. I visited homes of various size. Some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
homes were of the same size but their construction and organisation produced a different regime, atmosphere and level of quality. Those homes were allegedly of the same size because they had the same number of beds. I do not draw a hard-and-fast rule on that basis. I would be unhappy if county hall were to become a private sector nursing home. That should be ruled out of court straight away, as it would be a factory operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no public nursing home sector in the way that we have a public residential home sector. Local authorities have little experience to use a yardstick to check the nursing home sector. Health authorities have dealt with that sector. Few local authorities, especially in my region, have had much contact with the nursing home sector. The voluntary sector—the local active branch at Age Concern—has some experience of the nursing sector. I found a diversity between homes that were allegedly the same size. I do not agree that large homes, with up to 100 beds, should be classed as unacceptable. "You" can have badly run home of poor quality—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not have such a home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not referring to you, Mr. McWilliam. I was saying that it is possible for "you"—not you, Mr. Mc William—to have a large home with 100 beds of poor quality and it is also possible for a large home with 100 beds to be of excellent quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some large homes, in terms of number of beds, charge for all extras. Some large homes do not charge for any extras, whether newspapers, alcoholic drinks, chiropody, or hairdressing. Such homes exist. There is an enormous diversity of quality around the country. There should be a system—I am not saying that it will be easy to achieve it—that measures the quality against the number of beds. The quality test is the only one that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas of the country in which social services and health authorities are still not talking to each other. However, in those areas where they are talking to each other, I hope that quality tests can be codified, not rigidly, but not be dependent on the number of beds. I say that from experience, but I would have said so before that experience, because I have an aversion to the "big is bad, small is good" approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes you literally walk through the front door of a home and you know—not you, Mr. McWilliam—that the place does not work. Before even looking around any of the rooms or the kitchens, you know instinctively. That is the variety of human experience. That can be said about the homes of constituents, some of which are not very safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is important if it helps the Minister to understand that, at some time, there must be a more Armalite approach—I hate to use military expressions—to the measurement of quality rather than the blunderbuss approach of "it's big so it's bad; it's big so there is something wrong with it; or it's big so it is not homely". That is not true. A big home with many beds can be homely because of the way it is organised, both architecturally and socially. Some hospitals and homes have massive, long wards and corridors with lots of doors. Homes do not have to be so institutional. If owners and architects gave a little thought to the layout of buildings, it would not be necessary. I have been in homes where, although there are many beds, no corridor has more than five doors because of the way in which the place has been designed. Those homes are not institutional, they are homely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
I wish to enter a caveat—the number of beds is only one measure. It is the easiest aspect to home in on; like the actual size of rooms, it can be measured. It is a ludicrous proposition that a fitted wardrobe does not count as part ofa room, but the area on which a freestanding wardrobe stands is part of a room. That is happening. I visited a home in Plymouth last year. Fitted wardrobes were held not to be part of the room, so they found that the rooms did not have enough square metres. If the wardrobes had been freestanding, the area on which they stood would have been measured as part of the room. That is not what quality measurement is about. It is ludicrous; bureaucrats are taking over. People are trying to measure quality of care with a tape measure. I hope that if the Minister finds such cases he will sit on them straight away. The Minister should go to Torybrook in Plymouth, where there was that crazy system of measuring the size of homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One authority said to me, "We can't get the rooms big enough. Will it be alright if we put oriel windows in the rooms? Would that count as a few extra square feet of space
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Stockport. I did not suggest that we should deregister, although there are wide powers to deregister on a variety of grounds. I merely said the local authorities need not contract with or place residents in establishments where they believe the quality is unacceptable. One of the factors that they may use to judge quality is the size of an establishment, but that is only one factor. The hon. Member for Perry Barr made the point effectively that it is very hard to establish a direct relationship between size and quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wakefield invites me to prescribe a maximum, regardless of our reluctance to include a figure in the legislation. For all the reasons that I and the hon. Minister for Perry Barr have given, it is not sensible for someone sitting in Whitehall to produce a figure above which any establishment should not go. That would remove the ability to respond to individual needs. Common sense suggests that it would be difficult to run a 2,000-bed nursing home without an institutional feel. I find it hard to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
necessarily be expected of the private and voluntary sectors. It is important that the level playing field, of which we often speak, applies to standards and that equivalent standards are maintained in voluntary and private sector residential accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider inquiries that have focused on local authority residential accommodation because it is not the Bill's intention that private and voluntary care should be of a lower standard. We are talking not only about homes that are registered but unregistered homes and private homes. The purpose of running a private home is to make a living, and, presumably, if possible, to make a profit for those who run it. Therefore, it is especially important that that profit is not made at the expense of residents or the public sector, which would provide a considerable amount of the income of such homes, and that proper standards are maintained. When considering staffing numbers, we should insist on equivalent levels of care and make it clear that we are not about to open up to cowboys the management of residential care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical aspect of any home is its staffing. The amendment deals with staffing numbers but, of course, the number of staff is not in itself a guarantee of quality, but it is fair to say that, if staff numbers are too low, quality is not possible. Having the local authority designate the number of staff does not guarantee that a home will reach the standards that we wish to espouse. However, a shortfall in staff is pretty certain to result in a home in which some elements of care are lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can clearly see that there is more to staffing than numbers. As I have said, unfortunately, I have had much experience in the closure of residential homes. I completed the closure process on six homes in the Leeds authority area. I started and progressed the closure—to completion, in some cases—of a further 11 homes. One of the last things that I did regarding the local authority budget was, in March of this year, to initiate the closure of three further residential homes, giving me a total of 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, very few of the closures raised much objection from the relatives of those living in the homes. There was only one home whose closure prompted a tremendous objection, with a campaign being mounted by residents' relatives. It was not because that home was better staffed or because it was a better building, it was included in the closure programme because, although a fairly modern building, it was jerry-built and needed £200,000 of work to keep it open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of that home raised a large outcry among local residents and relatives because the quality of the care and the relationship between the staff and the residents was exceptionally good. Therefore, although it was not the most modern building and the number of residents and staff was on a par with other homes in the area, the home's closure aroused a quite different reaction from members of the public who were familar with its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When discussing staffing numbers we cannot write into legislation definitions of quality of care provided. Nevertheless, if numbers are inadequate, homes cannot provide the services that have made the home that I have mentioned so acceptable. People were divided into small groups in that home; there was individual care, and elderly people were involved in activities other than sitting in front of a television screen all day, which is often what one finds when visiting elderly persons' accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
It is important to emphasise staffing ratios. One of the advantages of closing 17 homes is that some of the resulting savings can be used to improve staffing ratios in other homes. My involvement showed me the importance of having adequate staff numbers and, especially, adequate cover. There is much heavy work to be done in accommodation for elderly people. They are often immobile and must be bathed and lifted. That can be back-breaking work and we should not encourage care assistants to do it alone. There must be enough people to ensure that elderly people receive the help that they need. One advantage of reducing the number of institutions is that it permits the introduction of a peripatetic team of staff to cover care at night. If people were taken ill at night and required lifting or bathing, help would be available for hard-pressed staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must judge homes by minimum staff levels. It is reasonable to insist on minimum staff levels. I referred earlier to a private sector home in the Leeds area that the local authority had to close because elderly people were being locked in their rooms at night without care. When challenged on the matter, the home's proprietor explained that on her income she could not maintain staff cover at night if she was not on duty. She wanted sleep when she was not on duty. That led to the easy step of making sure that there would not be too much trouble by locking the doors. That rapidly led to the establishment's closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staffing is an important issue. Local authorities must be satisfied that the minimum number of staff is in place in all establishments that take elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes back to the Griffiths report, which I shall quote because it is pertinent and the genesis of much of the Bill. I wonder why the following passage has not been accepted by the Govenment and found its way into the Bill. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registration and inspection system should consider appropriate staffing as at least as important as other aspects of a home. In particular, the person in charge needs to have skills, knowledge, experience and personal qualities to be able to create the necessary environment both for residents and staff so that the home can achieve its objectives. This will often include the recognition that the needs of residents may change over time, and that the objectives of the home and its staffing may need to change in order adequately to care for those residents who have made that home their own home."</p></blockquote>
The focus is on staff. It means that the numbers of staff vary, according to the purpose and objectives of a home. If the nature of a home changes, staff numbers must be reconsidered. At the genesis of the Bill, emphasis was placed on adequate staff numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residential care is much in the public eye. I established at the start that we are not trying to set two standards. Although the Howe report is primarily for the benefit of local authority homes, it deals with several points at issue. Local authorities may find its recommendation difficult to implement in the year ahead because of its implications for residential pay awards. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the middle of 1991 the residential care sector fell under the full glare of the media spotlight. In rapid succession the press was filled with the Staffordshire and Lancashire stories and revelations about inadequate care for elderly people."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to say more about that. Residential care has become the subject of greater public interest than previously because of the shortcomings of some local authority establishments. Some Home Office establishments have been shown to have similar deficiencies. The British Association of Social Workers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
distinguishes between the interest taken in children's homes and that taken in homes for the elderly. The association states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Residential/nursing home care for adults is of little importance to the general public. Although there have been scandals … these do not bring calls for change, whereas similar events in children's homes have led to public inquiries about staffing, buildings, training of staff etc."</p></blockquote>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the association is correct in that judgment. The public are interested in residential establishments of all sorts. The BBC produced a programme a couple of weeks ago about the conduct of an elderly persons' home. That home would not come under the Bill because it is in Scotland, but much abuse had occurred there. That such a programme was made suggests that there is public interest in the matter, and that applies to adults as well as children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the problem of staffing, there are numerous testimonies to the scale of the problem of residential care. The need for the Bill is shown by the way in which the private and voluntary sectors have increased their share of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anchor and other housing associations have published a document that shows that between 1984 and 1989 the number of people aged 65 and over in local authority homes dropped from 101,000 to 95,000. In the voluntary sector, the figure stayed fairly constant, changing from 26,000 to 25,800, while the private sector showed enormous growth from 52,000 to 111,000. That illustrates the trend of a drop in local authority provision and a sharp increase in private sector provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the number of people in private residential care, we must be especially careful about the standards that should be applied in that sector. The document states that there are now 232,000 places in residential homes and that by the year 2000 another 97,000 places will be needed. If the experience of my local authority is anything to go by, the vast bulk of those 97,000 places will be in private residential care. We must regulate a minimum safeguard in respect of staff numbers.

We must consider the cost of different types of care. I shall use figures provided by the Audit Commission. I had the honour of being a member of the Audit Commission for a number of years. Its research into this matter has been influential on the Government. We should consider the cost of different types of care. For a residential home the estimate per week per client is £210 a week, but for an unstaffed group home—which has relatively low staffing levels it is £119 a client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Howe report has a perspective on the same issue. Section 10.2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Staffing costs … represent two thirds of the costs of providing residential care (£ 1,034m out of a total cost of £1,544m in England in 1989–90)."</p></blockquote>
We understand that to make a profit from private residential care, the amount of money spent on staff must be controlled. It is clear that staffing plays a key role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Howe report refers to the way in which the elderly population will alter. It make recommendations on staffing numbers and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In homes for the elderly, the change in population has been dramatic. The proportion ofelderly people in local authority homes over 85 years of age has risen from 34 per cent. in 1980 to 46 per cent. in 1989…The provision for elderly people in 1984 and in 1987 in 6 health authorities,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
showed the percentages … who were moderately or severely confused increased from 30 per cent. to 46 per cent. in one region and 28 per cent. to 53 per cent. in another."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is not just the numbers that are increasing, but the degree of difficulty and the degree of care that people need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment follows the words used in the report, which are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Inquiry recommends that local authorities should set minimum staffing levels for each of their residential homes."</p></blockquote>
That is set solidly in the context of health and safety. This is an important issue. We should accept an amendment that allows local authorities the right to say no, if staffing at homes is not at an appropriate level. We must beware of the fact that we could be throwing the gates wide open for abuse to occur when we talk about unregistered homes. I could give examples of homes where difficulties have arisen. It is important to have safeguards. The amendment is an attempt to establish a proper and appropriate safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was an Audit Commissioner in Scotland for a number of years, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I never sought to make a profit out of private residential care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make some brief points to supplement the comprehensive comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South. We accept that the problem of staffing levels applies equally to local authorities—the public sector—as to the private and voluntary sectors. I was interested to read the reports of the health advisory committee and the social services inspectorate on staffing levels in care homes in Surrey. They were said to be dangerously understaffed. It is not just a problem in the private sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South is right to draw attention to the Howe report. Recommendation 3 of that report suggests that local authorities should set minimum staffing levels for each home. That is the essence of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for the staffing level problems in both the public and private sector is the low pay and poor conditions of the people who work in residential care homes. I am conscious of the problems in the public sector I am also aware of the appallingly low levels of pay offered in my area by many private care homes. The West Yorkshire low pay unit, which is based in Batley, has made a detailed analysis of the homes in West Yorkshire. It showed that there is a serious problem of low pay and poor conditions which affects the recruitment of staff to private care homes. I would welcome the Minister's comments on the bearing that developments in the European Community will have on future staffing levels in care homes. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the debate about the 48-hour week. The Secretary of State for Employment is to attend a meeting tomorrow in Paris about that matter. There has been less discussion of the issue in this place, but it is a cause for anxiety that in 1990 the European Community published proposals regarding working hours that are of direct relevance to the staffing of care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the proposed directive. It aims to introduce a uniform rule for minimum rest periods and maximum hours worked within defined periods. That would affect part-time staff and, in particular, shift workers and night workers. It covers minimum daily rest periods of 11 hours out of 24, with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
night shifts not to exceed eight hours in 24, averaged over a 14-day period, and a ban on two consecutive shifts when one shift involves night work. I am happy to support a move to improve the conditions of individuals working shifts and working nights, which is covered by the directive. However, it will create difficulties over care in the public and private sectors. The amendment is motivated by our worry that there will be increasing pressure on staffing levels as a result of the directive. I would welcome the Minister's response on how the directive relates to amendment No. 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the concern behind the amendment is to achieve the highest possible standards of care. The Government share that concern. I also acknowledge that the staffing level of an establishment is related more directly to the quality of care provided than to the issue of size, which we debated on the previous amendment. I do not have any quarrel with the intention behind the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the hon. Member for Wakefield recognised that the issue applies just as much to the local authority sector as it does to the independent sector. I cannot add anything new on the question of the European Community directive, in view of the discussions that are taking place. If European Community restrictions on the number of hours worked were to be become enforceable in this country, that would have some impact on the level of staffing required to operate residential care establishments, if members of staff are working longer hours than the restrictions allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is sensible for us to try to prescribe in detail in primary legislation the criteria which local authorities should take into account when making arrangements for placing residents. That applied to several issues raised in connection with previous amendments, and it applies again. It is right—and I hope that, for the most part, Opposition Members would welcome it—to leave local authorities a fair amount of discretion to decide what is best in the light of local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable difficulties in deciding necessary levels of staffing and various methods by which they can be calculated. We used one of them in "Home Life", the code of practice to which I have previously referred, but that document recognised that staffing requirements would vary considerably in light of the varying needs of residents. Some elderly people need relatively little help, whereas other people in establishments that cater for a slightly different category need much more assistance or supervision, perhaps because of a certain disability or combination of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we have not tried to prescribed specific levels of staffing in the Registered Homes Act 1984. We have said that there must be adequate staffing to meet the needs of residents. That is as far as it is reasonable to go. Indeed, I believe that there might be counterproductive consequences of prescribing minimum levels of staffing or inviting local authorities to do so. That might result in establishments in which the needs of residents require a higher level of staffing reducing numbers to the minimum prescribed by the local authority. For all those reasons, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1U) Arrangements shall only be made by virtue of this section where the voluntary organisation or other person providing the accommodation undertake not to discriminate in the service and accommodation provided to residents between residents maintained in the accommodation at public expense and other residents.'.</p></blockquote>
So far the Committee has been discussing how far you regulate the care market. Again and again, I have listened to the Minister saying that there is no need to regulate because the market will dictate the level of care, that the Government are giving money to local authorities so that they can buy services, and that authorities will not buy services that are unsatisfactory. Thus standards will be determined as a consequence of the buying power of local authorities or the choices that they make. I hope that the Minister will consider that approach very carefully, because it is far removed from reality. You can get regulation through price in the private market only if the buyer has sufficient money to make those sorts of choices. That works well in the private market only when people have the money to make the choice and when the choice is affordable. That is simply not happening in the private care market and it is unlikely to happen in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years, there has been a mixed economy—the real private market, in which people have been able to buy care because they have had sufficient income, and what is effectively the Government private market, in which grants have been provided through the Department of Social Services to people who do not have the money to buy private care. In somes homes, the result has been a mixed economy, and it has been very unsatisfactory. There has been a two-tier system, in which some residents have been fortunate enough to have the money to buy a high level of care, accommodation and services and others have been able to buy only at the level at which the DSS has allowed them, that is a fixed sum of money that is set by the Government and not responsive to market prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many homes, people have been provided with less satisfactory accommodation and services. I do not blame private homes for that. They have been caught out by Government policy and their attempts to move people from public care into private care. The level of grant has been prescriptive; in effect the Government have nationalised private care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two-tier system in homes is unacceptable. The care and services provided have nothing to do with the individual needs of people. It is the price of care that matters to them. I am sure that that was not the Government's intention, but it is a consequence of their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some homes in my area, people who can pay the full price of private care can have their own rooms. That is significant. Part of the problem with residential care is moving people from their own home, where they enjoyed the privacy of their own lives, into a home in whch they are deprived of that privacy by having to share a bedroom with someone they did not know and probably did not want to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you can buy a single bedroom for yourself, you can continue to enjoy privacy, which is very important to us all. However, people who have only the Department of Social Security grant cannot buy such privacy. They are often
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
placed in rooms with two, three or four beds. Worse, they may be moved to more and more crowded accommodation as the costs of care rise and the grant becomes inadequate to meet them. That process is leading to the very problem that the legislation was intended to avoid. The legislation was designed to give people choice and independence, but that is not happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters will not improve much. Although local authorities will be the purchasers, they will not have the money to make choices about levels of care. They will not be able to pay for them. Authorities will have to choose who they pay for and to which homes the money will be paid. That will lead to deteriorating standards of service and care for people without the private income that is necessary, if they are to exercise real choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that you pay your money and get what you get. That is not good enough. We should not place people here and there, according to what we can afford. If the Bill is to mean anything, each person's rights and needs must be considered. We must buy care suitable for those needs. The Bill is supposed to enable choices to be made. I am worried that that will not happen because the finance needed to enable choices to be made will not be given to local authorities. It is unacceptable for a person in a private home to receive, because of the money in that person's pockety, higher quality care and services than another person. That is unfair and will lead to a two-tier care system. That is not acceptable. If the Minister were to tell us that he intends to give local authorities the money to enable them to make choices, we should be happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would establish a right for residents in homes covered by the Bill to receive the same standards of service, whether they are paid for out of public funds or out of their own means. The amendment goes right to the heart of the Prime Minister's statements that we should develop a classless society. If you do not have the same standards for those who have to rely on public funds as for those who have private means, you do not have a classless society. Many academic studies show that the quality of life in care homes correlates closely with the amount of money spent upon those who are placed there. What you pay for is what you get. If there is a differential between what the public sector will pay on behalf of residents and what an individual of good means is able to pay, you will get a differential quality of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred in a previous sitting to a study that I conducted by interviewing many elderly people in a range of care establishments. I found that in every sort of establishment—nursing homes, residential homes, sheltered accommodation—the number of residents who expressed a preference for single rooms was greater than the number of people who had single rooms. Considerable numbers of elderly people were constrained to share rooms because they could not afford the additional cost of single rooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
I examined the fees charged by different establishments. The minimum fee charged by two thirds of establishments was at, or close to, the maximum that the DSS would pay. Almost all the homes also charged higher fees, invariably for single rooms. If we want to give elderly people the right to choose the independence, dignity and privacy of single rooms, we must legislate. In the absence of legislation, that objective is not being achieved. The right to equal treatment must be established in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started by saying that the amendment goes right to the heart of the Prime Minister's statements about a classless society. In the study that I mentioned, we asked residents how they classified themselves in terms of previous occupation and, therefore, social class. Within the private residential sector, using the Registrar-General's classifications, 36 per cent. of residents regarded themselves as being in social classes 1 and 2—professional and managerial occupations. The proportion in public sector homes, as defined by the residents themselves, was just under 10 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, the proportion in social classes 4 and 5 in private sector homes was 32.6 per cent. and in the public sector homes, 49.7 per cent. You can postulate two reasons for that correlation between social class and use of the public or private sector. It could be that working class people choose to go into public sector homes, which the Conservative party would doubtless say is due to the dependency culture, and that middle-class people choose to go into private sector homes. Alternatively, there could be a financial bar that prevents people on lower incomes going into private sector homes. That, I suspect, is the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one leaves this matter to market forces, a greater proportion of people on lower incomes will not have the choice that is open to those on higher incomes. If we believe in a genuine choice for everyone, and if we believe in breaking down the class divisions in society for elderly people as much as for any other group, we must establish in law that equal treatment, equal availability of services and equal quality of care will be provided for everyone, irrespective of their social class, their means and whether they are paying the cost from their own resources or are being supported from public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I think that there were more instances of "you" in that speech than in the speech of the hon. Member for Stockport, but never mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They seem to have much less to do with promoting choice then with denying people the right to spend their own money in the way that they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, local authorities would be able to make residential accommodation arrangements only with providers who undertook to provide exactly the same standard of service to all residents. That is a recipe not for increasing but for diminishing choice. It conjures up a nightmare vision of the sort that, on the whole, we have seen destroyed in eastern Europe, where identical and monotonous provision was made for elderly people, and others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I defend the right of people to spend their money as they wish.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister therefore register his disapproval of those circumstances in which relatives are placed under pressure to make good the difference between the amount of income support available for the cost of an elderly person's care and the actual cost of that care?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In exactly the same way that I defend the rights of individuals to spend their money as they choose, I wish to include in their options the right to contribute towards the cost of the residential care provided for one of their elderly relatives.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about people who do not have money to spend as they wish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows, people who are unable to meet the costs of residential care at the moment qualify for income support. From April 1993, if local authorities assess those people as being in need of residential care and if, after having applied the same financial tests, it is clear that those people do not have the resources to pay for their residential care, it will be provided at the taxpayers' expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interventions have helpfully teased out from Opposition Members the real philosophy behind the amendment. The fact is that people who choose to move into residential accommodation have a variety of needs and preferences. Therefore it is desirable that there should be a variety of types of accommodation to meet those individual requirements. The aims of the community care reforms are to encourage wider choice. If the amendment were accepted, it would mean that local authorities could not make arrangements with homes that provide choices about extra facilities for which residents are willing to pay from their own resources, or the resources of their relatives. All residents would have to accept, by law, exactly the same standard of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that all residents, irrespective of their financial circumstances, should have the right to and the choice of a single room, or is he saying that the right to and the choice of a single room should be reserved for those who, either themselves or through their families, have the financial resources to pay an additional top-up fee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect local authorities, when placing residents in an establishment, to have regard to the quality of the facilities that are available in that establishment. On the whole, the Government have recognised that it is desirable for as many people as possible to be accommodated in single rooms. That does not mean that everyone will be accommodated in single rooms. Indeed, there may be married couples who for obvious reasons would not necessarily wish to be accommodated in single rooms. The hon. Member for Stockport laughs, but there are many married couples—including, I believe, some of the highest in the land—who, even at an age before they have to enter residential care, decide that they prefer single rooms. I make no suggestions as to whether any members of the Committee fall into that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we can return from the high to the mundane, the Minister did not, with respect, answer my question. Will guaranteed access to a single room be dependent upon individuals or their families paying a top-up fee, or does the Minister believe that those who resort to public funds should be as able to enjoy a single room, if that is what they choose, as those with private means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful not to confuse two issues. I am determined that those people who wish to spend their own resources, or who have resources available from their families, should not be restricted by legislation from spending those resources in the way that they wish. That is a fundamental principle that I shall continue to defend. I regret that many of those who attack it do so from motives that do not reflect the interests of the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point to which the hon. Gentleman addressed himself is the quality of the accommodation to which those people who are paid for entirely out of taxpayers' or chargepayers' funds should be entitled. We want that accommodation to be of the highest possible standard, consistent with the resources that the local authorities will have after April 1993 and the resources that are available at present from the Department of Social Security. We are determined to see standards rise, and they have risen substantially over the past 20 years. Some members of the Committee are sufficiently familiar with the situation to know that standards have risen in residential care. We all welcome that, and I am sure that it will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not able to guarantee access to a particular type of accommodation for every resident who is paid for entirely from public funds. We shall continue to try to raise standards and I hope that the local authorities, when they are negotiating placements, will make sure that they get the best value for money from any independent sector providers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister fully understands the purpose of the amendment. If he does understand it, he has just treated us to an exposition of Tory philosophy and selfishness. The amendment would ensure that it would not be possible, to give a simple example, for individuals sitting around the same dinner table in a home to be given different size helpings because one happens to be on income support and is local authority funded, while the other is privately funded. The Minister appears to be justifying a situation in which, if I were in a care home on income support and he were using his own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
private resources, he would get two Yorkshire puddings and I would get only one. Is that his line? That is what he seems to be saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain of the view that if people have their own resources they should be allowed to spend them in the way that they choose. The hon. Gentleman keeps coming back to a restrictive policy. Individuals who have not spent their resources on goods and services that are unconnected with the residential home involved may wish to spend them in the home. It would be a sad day if the House passed legislation that denied people that right. That is a separate point. We—and, I believe, most of the local authorities that are taking on these great responsibilities—are determined to see that satisfactory and, where possible, rising standards of care are available to all residents, regardless of how they are funded. It would be unfortunate if the Committee passed an amendment that had the restrictive effects that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the guarantee of a single room will be available only to people who have the resources to pay an additional fee. He says that the guarantee of a second helping at meals will be available only to those who can pay. Some homes may be able to provide such services within the bounds of local authority provision, but he cannot guarantee that all will be able to do so. Will he list other services that should be available according to ability to pay rather than as a standard basic provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not find me so willing to give way if he so grossly misrepresents what I say. The Government's position is straightforward. We want all publicly-funded residents to receive a satisfactory standard of care. In the past 20 years, the quality of provision in residential homes has risen substantially. I hope and believe that that will continue to happen in the future. Residents who are placed by local authorities will receive a satisfactory standard of care and it is also likely that it will be a rising standard of care. I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not believe that Conservative Members would countenance passing an amendment that prevented people from spending their resources, or the resources that are available to them from their families, in the way that they choose. It is an absurd distortion to suggest that some people will get a second helping and others will not. The hon. Gentleman does himself and his party no credit by trying to construct an elaborate political point—based, I fear, on motives of envy of people with resources—to sustain the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the results of the next stage of the implementation of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 in April 1993 will be that local authorities will have contracts with home owners for the standard of care to be provided. Local authorities will be able to lay down minimum standards of care, about which Opposition Members are understandably concerned, and the services that are to be made available to all publicly-funded residents. The implementation of our legislation provides exactly the kind of opportunity that Opposition Members seek to ensure: that all publicly-funded residents receive a satisfactory standard of care and provision that is appropriate to their needs. That will be achieved by the legislation that has already been passed. The amendment would restrict choice, as I have explained. For that reason, I hope that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a couple of points in conclusion. The Minister's answers have been less than satisfactory, although, in some ways, they have been more than satisfactory, due to his openness. However, it is unworthy of him to inpugn the motives of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned value for money, but he must know that, when local authorities use their discretion and deliberately decide, as a matter of policy, to ensure that all local authority-funded and public-funded residents go into single rooms at extra cost, leaving double rooms empty, the district auditor will be down on them like a ton of bricks. It will have nothing to do with quality of care. The district auditor will tell them that they could have achieved quality of care more cheaply and provided value for money. The Minister ignores that fact at his peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, most of the debate has resolved around extra charges for different services, or levels of service. The point that I want to make, which is the other side of the coin, is that everyone within an establishment could receive the same level of service, whether it be a single room, extra helpings of food or medication, but what they are charged for that service depends on whether they are publicly or privately-funded. For example, last year I discovered one nursing home that asked each prospective resident whether he or she was self-funded. It transpired that if the prospective resident was self-funded, the fees were £340 per week and that, if they were not, the fees were £255 per week—which, I think, was the amount allowed by the Department of Social Security at that time. One assumes that the services provided were equal, yet the charges were different, depending on how people were funded. That is immoral. I do not know how the Minister can defend that. That puts people who are self-funded—perhaps only for a few years, as the assets of the family home do not last long if you are paying fees of £300 per week—in the position of cross-subsidising other residents. No one tells residents that that will happen. The owners of the homes do not spell it out and say, "Oh, there is a different level of charges because your money comes from a different source, so we can tap into that." That is immoral, but it is common practice throughout the country, particularly in nursing homes.

The Registered Nursing Homes Association, of which only one third of homes are members—it said that it would not accept one third of homes because they should be closed and that the other third would not join—wanted to ensure that home owners had a mix of residents. By "mix" it did not mean a mix of the sexes or a mix of nursing needs but a mix of resources. That would enable them to charge some people more for the same services to cross-subsidise the rest because, otherwise, the homes would go out of business. That is a deliberate consequence of Government policy. It is immoral and indefensible. Since the Minister's approach has been wholly negative, I give notice that we shall return to the matter on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1ZA) Arrangements may only be made by virtue of this section in respect of unregistered homes providing accommodation for fewer than four persons where the relevant local authority is satisfied that a high standard of care is provided and satisfactory arrangements are in place for monitoring the standards of use.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deal with the illogical situation in which homes with fewer than four residents will not be subject to the same inspection and monitoring process as homes with four or more residents. I shall draw an analogy with the Children Act 1989. Under that Act, a foster parent who has four children on a long-term basis is required to register as a small children's home and is subject to inspection and monitoring. If there are fewer than four foster children, the home comes under the fostering legislation. That legislation is exacting and prescriptive about what shall and shall not be done with children in foster homes. Similar criteria apply to elderly people when four or more are involved. For fewer than four people there is an enormous gap and difference in expectations of how the inspection and monitoring small homes should be conducted. That is illogical. As it stands, the Bill will make it very difficult to detect abuse of elderly people in small homes. There will be no inspection and monitoring process. All that will be required is an annual return which will be kept as short and simple as possible—the so-called light touch—so that not to many heavy demands are made on the carers who have to make the annual returns. At the same time, the annual return is supposed to alert local authorities to any factors that are likely adversely to affect the well-being of residents. How that will happen I cannot quite see. The return will be made on an annual basis. There will be no requirement, in the interim period, to disclose any changes—even of the person running the home, although logically that should lead to a new application—or to disclose that people have moved in or out of the home, which can dramatically change what is happening there. In effect, the criterion governing whether a home is a fit home is the fitness of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
person in charge to run the home. That has several shortcomings. Although initially there is an obligation to disclose criminal offences, there is no obligation to disclose ongoing criminal offences. Someone in charge of a small home could be guilty of tax evasion, VAT evasion and encouraging staff to evade tax and national insurance contributions. No running check is kept, and there is no need for people to disclose those convictions, except in their original job application. That is clearly absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual return will make it very difficult for a local authority to pick up signs that things are not quite right in a home. For example, I should have thought that it would be very important for the person in charge of the home to disclose the home's financial circumstances—whether there was a mortgage, for example, and, if so, what the repayments were. Such information could help alert the local authority to any financial difficulties. But there is no obligation to disclose the home's financial circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual returns are glaring in their omissions about what must be disclosed. There is no obligation to give any information about the quality of care provided. I should have thought it quite important for information to be given about the activities, facilities and outside services provided for residents, but that information is not required. The annual return is all that the local authority has; that is its only idea of what is going on. No doubt the Minister will say that it is up to the local authority to judge whether it thinks that the standard of care in a home is adequate and that, if it does not like it, it need not buy it. But that is not my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, as far as possible, protect elderly people from abuse. Abuse occurs, irrespective of the size of a home. The inspection and monitoring processes for larger homes provide safeguards, but there is a lack of safeguards for those living in smaller homes. For the life of me, I cannot understand why that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that we should not make assumptions about the size of a home and the quality of care that it provides, but that is precisely what he is doing by not requiring the same inspection and monitoring procedures to be followed in smaller homes. He is saying that we can make gross assumptions about how homes with fewer than four people should be inspected and monitored. The Minister's remarks should be consistent. He should not make assumptions about the size of homes and about the quality of care provided in small homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of child abuse, the Minister will know that in most cases children are abused in their own homes. Small homes give rise to abuse; the smallness of a home is not, in itself, a safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister be consistent and, as a matter of urgency, amend the Bill to ensure that the monitoring and inspection procedures for smaller homes are the same as those for larger homes, so that elderly people are protected from the possibility of abuse? We cannot assume that because there are fewer than four people in a home, they do not need the same safeguards as those who live in larger homes. That is illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely sure that the arrangements for small homes should be based on criteria identical to those which apply to foster homes. The hon. Member for Stockport opened her speech with an analogy based on that idea.

The first and, perhaps, the most important point is that, in their contract, local authorities—this applies to small as well as to large homes—can specify standards of quality and monitor the implementation of contracts to ensure that those standards are achieved. A local authority that failed to do that would lay itself open to criticism, regardless of any legislative requirements. It is right that we should adopt a lighter touch with small homes. It is important to recognise that we are now discussing establishments that are different from those which occupied our attention in earlier debates. We are discussing people making provision, perhaps in their own homes, for one or two elderly residents. The atmosphere, arrangements and circumstances are different from those in large establishments, whether run by a voluntary organisation, a local authority or a private company. Because of the different nature of very small homes, it was agreed when the Registered Homes (Amendment) Bill was introduced that the regulations should take a different form. The issue was fully debated and many different views were expressed, but the overall conclusion was that we should be careful not to do anything that would detract from the atmosphere and quality of life that are, perhaps, uniquely available in very small establishments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that there will never be incidents of abuse in small homes as a result of their homeliness? If he cannot give that guarantee—he will not be able to do so—will he say how it is possible to monitor the care to prevent any abuse arising? I am disturbed about his assumptions regarding atmosphere and care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady says, of course I cannot give such a guarantee; no one could do so, even if we passed the most prescriptive legislation that went far beyond amendments which the committee has rejected. Legislation alone does not provide a guarantee against abuse; but we believe that in very small homes the best safeguard is the calibre and reliability of the person in charge, who is better able to keep a close eye on what happens than is the case in an establishment with 20 or 30 residents. The essential test that we apply is that people must be fit to run small homes, just as those who run larger homes must be fit to do so. The Registered Homes (Amendment) Act 1991 includes a requirement that provides protection for vulnerable residents through that process. As small homes are brought within the registration requirements, local authorities will, for example, be able to check with the police for details of any criminal convictions against would-be proprietors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the difference between the inspection and monitoring process for small homes and larger homes arises because the homeliness of small homes is due to the calibre of the person in charge. He said that it is not necessary to monitor standards and inspection techniques in small homes. Why is he introducing monitoring and inspection processes for large homes but not for small homes, if he does not believe that those processes alone are important in regulating care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Minister that that is beyond the scope of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, so I shall make my response as brief as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference between the anxiety about what may, regrettably, occur in large homes and in small homes. Establishments with a significant number of staff clearly need a different regulatory climate from establishments which may be run by a landlady, perhaps with her husband—or perhaps the other way round—in the 1990s. It is right to distinguish between the regulatory obligations of local authorities in regulating small homes and large homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point made by the hon. Member for Stockport on annual returns. She may know that we recently consulted on the details that should be included in annual returns. We shall specify them in regulations. Home owners will be required to complete annual returns to local authorities. One of the objectives is to keep local authorities up to date with any changes in homes that may affect the standard of care and also alert local authorities about matters that require further investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we know how many small homes there are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman, but he will know that the requirements for registering very small homes are not yet in force. Legislation has been passed but the requirements will not come into force until the Bill before us comes into force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. I served with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) on the Standing Committee that considered the Registered Homes (Amendment) Act 1991 and I know the timetable. Various "guesstimates" have been made and range from 300 to over 1,000 homes in Birmingham. I should like to know how many homes there are in Woodspring, Chesham and Amersham, Portsmouth, Erewash and Aylesbury. I want some figures. Can we have a guarantee—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It would be useful to have that information because time is short and there is enormous variation in the estimates of the number of homes that will be inspected. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's interest. I shall establish what information is available on the number of small homes. I suspect that, in advance of the requirement for registration coming into force, our information will be an estimate rather than a precise total. The existence of these homes is a plus point, in that it gives local authorities a wider choice of accommodation available for residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that a lighter touch is necessary for small homes and that the Registered Homes (Amendment) Act 1991 will apply from April 1993. Has he had an opportunity to study the extent to which the registered homes tribunals have had difficulties in deciding who is a fit person to be in charge of a residential care home, whether large or small? I suggest that he should read the report on the first year of the tribunals' operations. They considered approximately 26 cases, 10 of which were related to the fit person clause. Eight appeals were dismissed and two were upheld. One appeal was from a proprietor who had served a two-month prison sentence for impersonation during a parliamentary election. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
other concerned someone who had had a bad reference from a previous hospital employer, who said that the applicant should not be employed in such activities. Those appeals were upheld and the applicants were deemed to be fit to provide care. Is the Minister satisfied that the light touch does not already exist under the 1984 Act and its interpretation by the registered homes tribunals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to a couple of detailed cases which I have not had the opportunity to examine, so I do not wish specifically to comment on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the principle of the lighter touch is right. Clearly, we shall wish to be satisfied that registration authorities satisfactorily discharge their responsibilities. If that does not appear to happen in several cases, I shall certainly wish to look into and reflect on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not attacking the registration authorities. I refer to the registered homes tribunal not taking account of the quite reasonable objections of registration authorities about the suitability of certain persons to run care homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's clarification. I shall examine the cases to which he referred to ascertain whether I believe his anxieties are justified. In my view, the key to adequate monitoring of the very small homes rests with the registration authority being able to satisfy itself that the person who is to run a small home is fit to do so. With that size of establishment, that is undoubtedly by far the most important criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate on the amendment and it has been helpful to me in airing some of the issues. However, I recommend the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not very satisfied with the Minister's response. There are many illogicalities and inconsistencies. The Minister's belief in different systems for small and for large homes is unsatisfactory. Moreover, he has not satisfied me about how standards of care in small homes will be monitored and inspected. The issue is worthy of a lengthier debate. Therefore I shall not press the amendment. I hope that we shall be able to discuss the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(IZC) Arrangements shall only be made by virtue of this section where the relevant authority is satisfied that the views of any person to be placed in accommodation have been taken into account.".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
I was not sure whether you were about to deem it to be One o'clock, Mr. McWilliam, as we have made such rapid progress this morning. I wonder whether you realise how much progress we have made: we have had debates on four amendments and a Division. There are only three amendments left after this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 relates to consultation. People should be consulted. Although the amendment is narrowly drawn, carers should also be taken into account. Therefore I hope that you will not be overly restrictive in the few minutes that we shall spend debating the amendment today, Mr. McWilliam, and, indeed, on Thursday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People must be able to make an informed choice when they move from their own homes to residential accommodation, whether it be homes covered by the Bill's provisions or residential or nursing care. They can make an informed choice only if there has been genuine consultation with those drawing up the care plan—probably the social services, or it may be the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation must be genuine. The approach must not be, "We have found this nice home for you, Mrs. Smith"—not "you", Mr. McWilliam. In other words, it must not be a fait accompli. Too many people have ended up in residential care who, when asked about it, are not certain why they are in a specific home; indeed, their carers may not be certain why. It may be because it was convenient for a social services department; it may have depended on a person's previous accommodation: his or her own home may have been rented or purchased. There may be various complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the consultation must be genuine. It is a big step for a person to make such a move—in one sense, to ask for help. By and large, people do not want to be thought of as ending up in care. It is a big step for people to make that contact with the authorities and to ask for help. Such factors must be taken into account. It is a highly sensitive issue. Consultation must involve more than simply a choice of establishments; it must take account of the fact that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
