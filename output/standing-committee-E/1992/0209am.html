	<time>Tuesday 9 February 1993</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR JOHN HUNT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I seek your advice on a matter relating to the financial memorandum to the Bill. In Committee on 28 January, the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education referred to the cost of tribunals. There is an issue at stake on which I require your guidance, Sir John. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><q><p>"We estimate the annual cost of setting up a tribunal at £1 million a year."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 28 January 1993; c. 1181.]</p></q>
However, in the financial memorandum to the Bill, on page xvii, it states:
	<br><q><p>"The costs of the Tribunal will be fully covered by savings in the running costs of central Government and in the administration costs of local education authorities whose appellate functions will transfer in full to the new Tribunal."</p></q>
Therefore, I asked the Department and the Welsh Office how many appeals were handled by local authorities in each of the past three years. The reply from the Department for Education was:
	<br><q><p>"The information requested is not available centrally."</p></q>
And the reply from the Welsh Office was:
	<br><q><p>"Information is not held centrally on the number of appeals against the provision in a statement of special educational needs which went before a local appeals committee nor of the costs of running the system in each local education authority. However, the number of appeals against statements to my right hon. Friend are shown as follows".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 February 1993; Vol. 218, c. 	<i>347–64.</i>]</p></q>
There have been none this year, and there were three last year and two the year before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the financial memorandum state that the costs will be financially neutral, when the Department for Education does not know what it costs local authorities to run their appeals system? On top of that, the Department for Education seems to have plucked a figure out of the air. How can the statement in the financial memorandum be correct? Where does the Department for Education get that estimate of £1 million? It says that it has estimated the cost of running the appeals in each local authority in each of the past three years, but it has no information on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek your advice, Sir John, on how we can get to the bottom of this. How does the Department for Education know that the cost will be financially neutral when it does not know what it costs local authorities to run their appeals system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, but I cannot offer advice on the matter.

	<li>for any such agreement to have effect accordingly.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(2) Any sums received by a funding authority in the exercise of those functions shall be paid to the Secretary of State.'—[	<i>Mr. Forth.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that the Minister did not explain new clause 22 to the Committee. I understand that it provides for the funding agency to take over the responsibilities of the Department for Education for funding city technology colleges under section 105 of the Education Reform Act 1988. Under that section, the city technology colleges are funded through a formal agreement between the Department for Education and the proprietor of each college. The amount of funding is based on the estimated cost of pupil funding in a group of LEAs. However, CTCs have no access to the special purpose
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1434</span>
grants that other schools may receive. The Government seem to intend CTCs to be funded in the same way as grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
City technology colleges have been funded more generously, in terms of capital costs, than any grant-maintained school, despite the initial bribes to persuade maintained schools to opt out. Middlesbrough CTC managed to attract only £1·5 million of private money out of the £6 million that was needed to set it up. The Government's contribution of £4·3 million was far more than the £3·6 million that Cleveland county council received in the same year for 238 schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Government believe that the new clause will mitigate the embarrassing failure of their policy for CTCs. The so-called Gerbil, envisaged that there would be 20 CTCs by the early 1990s. The then Secretary of State spoke of the Conservative party conference about the funding of the 20 CTCs. He stated that
	<br><q><p>"all or a substantial part"</p></q>
of the capital costs would come from private sources. The reality has been exactly the opposite. Only 16 CTCs are running and the Government have had the devil's own job trying to get industrialists involved in their sponsorship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause gives the Government the opportunity to get themselves off an embarrassing hook. They are subsuming the funding of CTCs into the funding agency and the grant-maintained sector. I do not know whether the existing CTCs should be alarmed for their financial future; even if the Government had kept the CTCs separately funded from the funding agency for grant-maintained schools, they could still, no doubt, decide to change the funding formula to bring it in line with grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the capital funding of CTCs is 79 times the funding provided for local authority schools. It is phenomenal to think of money being wasted on a totally unnecessary experiment. If the money had been available to the mainstream sector of education, far more could have been done with it. Nationally published test results and inspectors' reports show that the experiment failed: CTCs had poor results in technology and there were critical reports from the inspectorate on the delivery of technological subjects. Perhaps, over time, the name of CTC will be changed and an inglorious experiment in English educational history will end. I say English educational history because the experiment has not been conducted in Wales or Scotland, for which the Celts are thankful. I hope that the corpse will be buried and that the funding will keep on a more even keel for maintained schools as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is arguing from the individual to the general in reference to results, inspections and so on. I cannot understand his argument that the clause will get the Government off the hook. If the schools are not doing well under the auspices of the LEAs and the Government propose to put them under the central funding authority, for which they will have continuing and direct responsibility, how will that get the Government off the hook?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding of CTCs is the responsibility of central Government: the local authority involvement in CTCs is minimal. I have given the example of the lady whose son got very bad treatment in terms of special educational needs from the borough of Wandsworth and the CTC in that borough. The CTC said that the child
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1435</span>
needed 17 hours of special tuition a week, but that it could not provide it. Wandsworth borough also said that it would not provide it. If Wandsworth borough had any say in what went on in the CTC, it would have ensured that the special provision needed by that child was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
City technology colleges have only a distant relationship with local education authorities. Such colleges are the child of the Government, by whom they have been financed. They have been a failure. The new clause is a device to allow them to wither on the vine and to become part of the funding agency. No doubt, it is only a matter of time before their name is changed and it will be goodbye to the CTCs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I detect a note of wishful thinking in the hon. Gentleman's final remarks. City technology colleges are here to stay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly resented his opening reference to initial bribes in connection with grant-maintained schools. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman might wish to withdraw that grossly unfair remark. It insults all the parents of children at grant-maintained schools. The hon. Gentleman is a fair-minded man and will see that that remark was uncalled for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He described CTCs as a corpse. I do not understand why he said that, and suspect that his reasoning will be lost on Conservative Members. A corpse that has 10,000 children must be pretty vigorous. Wherever they are set up, CTCs are always over-subscribed. That is genuininely exciting. Young people like them, as do their parents. They add to the choice, diversity and colour of our educational system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall wait for 	<i>Hansard</i> to appear but I believe that I said that CTCs would become a corpse. To carry on the analogy, CTCs are on a life support system, generously provided by the Department for Education—as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) has just whispered to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had my way, CTCs would be funded entirely by the taxpayer. Some hon. Members in Committee, especially the hon. Member for Bridgend, (Mr. Griffiths) will recall that we discussed the matter at some length in the Committee considering the Education Reform Bill. At that time, I told my right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), who was then Secretary of State for Education, that it would have been wise for the Department to put its funding where its beliefs were and place it with the schools, without looking for a contribution from industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the example quoted by the hon. Member for Bridgend, industry put up no less than £1·5 million. That is an entirely laudable contribution. Industry already makes a contribution through tax, but its commitment to CTCs was such that it was able to produce an extra £1·5 million. That is a significant sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the fact that any industry that contributes to a city technology college does so over and above the call of duty. I do not dispute, either, the generosity of contributions. However, when we debated the matter in Committee, as the hon. Gentleman will remember, the Secretary of State—we had the pleasure and privilege of the presence of the then Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1436</span>
in that Committee—said clearly that he expected most of the capital costs to come from industry, which would be excited by the opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He said 90 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, 90 per cent. The then Secretary of State told the Tory party conference that the capital costs would be "wholly or mainly" from industry. Let us not forget that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued. Apparently, the recession has passed the hon. Gentleman by. English Members are aware that we are in a recession, which is international in its magnitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment, when I have finished with the point made by—I almost referred the hon. Member for Bridgend as the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bovis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is sufficiently close to make no difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a substantial world recession and the fact that £1·5 million can still be produced for a school is an enormous tribute to British industry. It would be good to hear what the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have to say about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to get away with that statement. Does he accept that if the recession has passed Opposition Members by, it has also passed by his right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley? "A New Choice of School", the document which first proposed the scheme, states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State will expect promoters to meet the costs of buildings and equipment or to contribute a substantial part of those costs."</p></q>
In reality, in 16 city technology colleges, 80 per cent. of the capital and equipment costs and have been paid for by the Department. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley, when challenged in the House about the failure, even in the early stages, to attract support from business and industry said:
	<br><q><p>"There will be a network of at least 20 CTCs … I assure the House that they will be there."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 July 1988; Vol. 137, c. 925.]</p></q>
Does not that have a similar reflection on the comments about the number of grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that long, convoluted, confused intervention. The hon. Gentleman forgot to say that those comments were made in 1987. I am not sure where he has been for the past six years. Perhaps he has been in a Rip Van Winkle sleep, like many of his Liberal friends. The recession appears to have passed by the hon. Member for Bridgend in his sleeping Welsh valley. In 1987, the world was a different place. It bore little resemblance to 1993, as the hon.

I was about to move modestly forward from my opening remarks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The city technology college in Middlesbrough that I referred to was set up in 1988. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that Britain has been in recession for longer than any other country and the rest of the world is beginning to catch us up, and that the recession has been severe, with the Government piloting us into deeper and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1437</span>
deeper water, I am aware that that is the case. Allowing for the recession, I believe that industry's response has been wise but, in Tory terms, it has been entirely lamentable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would truly welcome an opportunity—I know that my hon. Friends would join me—to debate the economy of our country. We have confidence in our ability to carry that debate forward and to win it but, sadly, Sir John, you might feel that I would be a little wide of the new clause. Therefore, unlike Opposition Members, I shall maintain the course and thrust of my remarks. I deeply regret the passing of the old technical schools and colleges. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Hon. Members moan because, in their ignorance, they do not understand what technical schools and colleges achieved for the young people of our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I should like to point out to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) that I attended a school that, while I was there, was transformed into a grammar technical school, so I know exactly what used to happen in such places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And I have to point out to the hon. Gentleman that I am the product of a technical school. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I did not enjoy a privileged background. Let me say this to the hon. Gentleman: I was born a member of the working class, was brought up in the working class and have remained faithful to my class ever since.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This just cannot go on. We must revert to CTCs. Personal reminiscences are not in order at this stage in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was sidelined in that fashion, Sir John, and that I was moved by emotion to draw on my childhood. I am sorry that I was out of order but I feel deeply and passionately about this subject. I want children to enjoy the benefits that I had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right in one respect. He referred to the CTC pilot scheme. I am prepared to accept his figure of 16, although I think that he is wrong and that it was 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sixteen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's figure is 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is 14 CTCs now, but there will be 15 in September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the words of my hon. Friend the Minister who, of course, has all such figures at his fingertips. He does his homework, and so he is able to provide the Committee with the invaluable advice that we so often require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have placed on the new clause an interpretation similar to that set out by the hon. Gentleman in his opening remarks—that it is a method of getting more CTCs. I think that CTCs do enormous good. As I said earlier, I find it significant that the majority of CTCs have so far emerged in the inner cities. One could say that there is an inner-city mission hand in hand with the concept of grant-maintained schools. An enormous emphasis is placed on important subjects such as mathematics, technology and science. I am anxious to see
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1438</span>
those subjects developed and advanced. I do not contradict myself when I say that I welcome the fact that CTCs are of mixed-ability entry. The CTC in Nottingham, for example, serves an area which, sadly, is a little run down and the school has no selection policy. Consequently, children flock to that school where they enjoy the benefits of a remarkable education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is to reduce the central administrative costs of making payments. Conservative Members consider that a laudable and helpful objective. Unlike Opposition Members, we like to see funding used for the children's benefit. We want funding to go to the chalk face, to use the cliché. That is the benefit of the new clause. Approximately 10,000 pupils are educated in city technology colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has discussed what he feels to be the merits of city technology colleges, will he comment on their rather poor results as published so far and on the criticisms that the HMI has made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention because it shows that CTCs are not favoured above any other school and that they take their chances with the broad mass of pupils, in common with any other school. We are not discussing selective systems or grammar schools, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) implied on previous occasions. We are discussing the inner cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the next CTC will be established in Battersea? The Battersea CTC will replace a school that covers an area from which one would not expect advantaged children to come. That school's results place it at the bottom of the pile, desperately trying to attract pupils, even escapees from Lambeth. I should not be the least surprised if, a year after that school becomes a CTC, it still has problems matching the national average test results. However, once that school has been up and running and serving that part of Battersea for several years, I believe that the standard of education will have risen, and the choice for parents and their children will have improved. That school will contribute to quality in London—which was bitterly resented and resisted by the former Inner London education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we have it. What a splendid intervention that was. My only regret is that that CTC is being established in my hon. Friend's constituency of Battersea and not in Rugby and Kenilworth. I wish that we were as fortunate in Warwickshire as my hon. Friend is in attracting a city technology college and the industrial funding that will, no doubt, accompany it. I find it genuinely extraordinary that, at this time of modest recession, industrialists are still able to put their hands in their pockets and to produce sufficient funding to enable a CTC to develop in Battersea.

By discipline, and I am not really going back to my roots, I am an engineer. I spent my early formative years working in engineering companies such as British Piston Ring, where I was involved in modest work on physical and chemical analysis of certain materials used in piston liners and in piston rings. I mention that only to demonstrate my belief that the engineer's role in the United Kingdom is not always appreciated. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am delighted that Opposition

Members agree. I hope that they will applaud similar remarks that I shall make about engineering and manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bellieve that the strength of the nation is dependent on the strength of its manufacturing industry, which, in turn, is based on the engineer. One of the reasons why we do not have a strong manufacturing base is because we do not appreciate the engineer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying too wide of the new clause, which relates to the funding of CTCs. We must return to that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the funding of CTCs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall willingly give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that he will refer to engineering and engineers because I suspect that he and his hon. Friends share my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, Sir John, you have already warned us about digressing too far on to the subject of engineers. I should like to concentrate on funding. Will the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth comment on the fact that, of the 100 largest British companies quoted on the stock exchange, only six have involved themselves in city technology college schemes? Does he think that the former director general of the CBI Sir John Banham, was right to describe city technology colleges as "an irrelevancy"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must gently suggest that the other Sir John, Sir John, is somewhat short-sighted. I regret that some industrialists do not see matters as clearly as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was looking at my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight). She has a wide knowledge of engineering, both from her contact with that great industrial city of Sheffield and from her business experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the recent survey carried out by INLOGOV, which has shown that Sheffield is one of the five best-managed cities in Britain, has contributed considerably towards that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know what is wrong with hon. Members this morning, but we are going very wide of the business before the Committee. It must be because we are approaching the end of the proceedings. I ask hon. Members to keep to the clause under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of funding, if I were to distill my remarks into a single drop, their essence would be that I support additional funding for city technology colleges. I am not averse to the emergence of more CTCs via some sort of grant-maintained route. Whatever route we select, I want more of those admirable and excellent schools to come forward. I know that they will provide substantial benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reinforce my hon. Friend's point about the excellence of CTCs. The headmistress of one of the schools in my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1440</span>
constituency, Valerie Bragg, was head of the first CTC in the United Kingdom. That gave me the opportunity to visit the CTC in Birmingham. Not only does it provide a high standard of education, but it works on an all-ability basis and provides a beacon of excellence for schools in the area; for secondary schools that are trying to attain the same standards and also for the primary schools that feed them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend, although I am not surprised by his intervention. Hon. Members may be interested to know that, in Committee, there are no fewer than four former or present officers of the Conservative Back-Bench education committee. That is probably one of the reasons why the contributions of Conservative Members have been so good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) is a former secretary. Ms. Bragg attended one of our Back-Bench education committee meetings and referred to the funding of city technology colleges. Hon. Members will be reassured to know that I break no confidences when I say that she was interested in the need adequately to fund CTCs and to ensure that more of them develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CTC in Solihull serves part of the west midlands and provides an excellent education for many young people. I wish, however, that more funding went into CTCs and that, for example, a CTC was established in Coventry or another of our great cities. The hon. Member for Yardley is, sadly, not in her seat but she is within the Room and can hear my remarks. Should she wish to come back into the Committee to make a contribution I would give way. The hon. Lady was a deputy leader of a Labour group on Warwick district council and is now a respected Member of Parliament for Birmingham. I am sure that she would join in hoping that a CTC will be established there. Who knows, perhaps it would be funded by that very great philanthropic family, Cadbury. If the hon. Lady, perhaps with the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest, whose knowledge of Birmingham is massive and extraordinary, would join in a direct approach to the Cadbury family, we might have some success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a bit rich for the Labour party to criticise the lack of numbers or funding of CTCs when it was that party, when it controlled the Inner London education authority, that did much to destroy education in London? It blocked and blocked again efforts to bring CTCs to my part of south London. It was only when the boroughs were able to run their own affairs that we rescued Mayfield school, which had been a great school under Dame Margaret Miles. It had been destroyed wontonly by ILEA and we put in the ADT CTC. ILEA refused site after site for the Battersea technology college and, in the process, lost funding from several companies, including major national newspapers and media companies. It is only now that we have been able to set up the new Battersea college.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have experienced a totally obstructive attitude from Labour-controlled authorities not only in Battersea but in Birmingham. Once the success of the CTC at Kingshurst in Solihull was established, there was great interest from the industrial community to set up another in Birmingham itself. Several interested people spoke to me about it. Sadly, despite approaches to Birmingham city council about redundant buildings that could be used for such an institution, which would have been a beacon of excellence for education in the city and which would have given great opportunities in technology for pupils from the inner city, the council's purblind and ideological opposition thwarted that marvellous opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can afford to laugh at that intervention. I give way to the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) who, I am sure, will make a worthwhile contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman associate my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer that question, but I shall start with a confession. I am not a cricketing buff. Coming from Rugby, my sport is the other one. I congratulate the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman does not confine his comments to the new clause, I shall ask him to resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1442</span>
Committee the thought that I am anxious to see more city technology colleges. I believe passionately in them and if they are able to spring from grant-maintained schools, so be it. They will be a lusty and worthwhile offspring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the ambulatory peroration of the person whom we now know to be a lumpen, technic, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, but he went rather wide of the mark. I draw his attention—I shall not speak at great length, because I never do—to the composition of CTCs. Conservative Members have said rightly that CTCs cater for a variety of abilities, but they did not mention the most important factor in gaining success—motivation. As the hon. Member for Battersea said, many more people have chosen to go to city technology colleges than have been accepted. That is important because it is clear that CTCs should obtain outstanding success, especially in examinations, but the opposite has been the case. In many ways, the Government are right in the new clause in that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, CTCs are being abolished and put directly under the control of the funding agencies. My hon. Friend equally wisely said that CTCs are an object lesson in what not to do. They disturb relationships and do not improve the quality of education. On the contrary, they seem to reduce the quality and some very able children are being denied their birthright because it is not possible for CTCs to be run as they should be. That serious matter should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth got very upset about the use of the words "initial bribes" by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. He asked for those words to be withdrawn. I shall do so, and instead say that inducements were given. Everyone in education is familiar with the notion of inducements. The technical and vocational education initiative was a most spectacular example. Huge sums of money were poured into the initial TVEI pilot projects. What happened? The larger TVEI grew, the less money went into the programme. Some parts were left to die and wither on the branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth also said that he had argued for 100 per cent. funding for CTCs. His argument was very successful—the money was not forthcoming and funding only reached 80 per cent. I call that a success for the hon. Gentleman. Did private industry fail to do its duty? As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, prestigious private industry takes a long view of such matters and decided that CTCs were not the path to tread. That is why industry did not invest much money in such colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corpse that CTCs will become is destined either for incineration or putrefaction. The Government's actions mean that it will undergo a rapidly accelerating putrefaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on his excellent and emotive speech in defence of CTCs. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Bridgend chose to debate the new clause. In many ways, it is unexceptional and makes a lot of sense. It brings the funding for CTCs into the new arrangements proposed by the Bill. The hon. Gentleman mounted a depressing tour de force, in which he brought out the familiar littany of hostility towards anything that is not run by an LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that he and his Tory friends opposed our attempts to allow
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1443</span>
parents to name non-maintained independent special schools in their children's statementing process. The hon. Gentleman should be more careful and less blinkered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, that is not the issue under consideration this morning, so I shall waste no time on that. The sad reality is that Opposition Members consistently oppose any move to increase choice and diversity in the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why have there not been more CTCs? That is an interesting question. I make no secret of my disappointment that there have not been more. My hon. Friend was right to say that recession has made business men unwilling to come forward with funds, but it is also true that the Opposition were determined to stir up the whole issue of CTCs. Quite understandably, many industrialists were not prepared to invest money in what they perceived to be a controversial initiative. The net result is that many children have been denied what would have been a worthwhile chance to receive a technically biased education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to think that we had that effect, but the hon. Gentleman attributes to us too much influence. Of far more importance is the view of the former director general of the Confederation of British Industry that city technology colleges are an "irrelevancy".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that certain people in industry have a narrow view of the benefit and value of CTCs. It is significant that those who invested were thrusting entrepreneurs who looked to the future rather than, regrettably, to the past, although I understand that industrialists had to be cautious because of the battles that took place in the local authorities that were courageous enough to encourage CTCs in their areas. I was on Croydon's LEA when we were kept up until one o'clock in the morning on many occasions to debate the setting up of the two CTCs that we are proud and privileged to have in our area. Such opposition made it difficult to get some of the CTCs off the ground, but where they have been set up they are beginning to prove their worth. They have been very popular. In Croydon a high school was attracting few first places from pupils within the borough, but it is now massively oversubscribed and many parents are sending their children to it from inner London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have in Croydon an even more radical initiative: the city technology college for the performing arts. Many youngsters are transferring at the age of 13 for the opportunity to receive such a unique education. Opposition Members would deny those youngsters that education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Second time in this Committee I have to say that I resent the attempt by Labour Members to criticise the CTCs for the standards of education that they achieve. It is ironic that in the past they have refused to criticise individual LEAs schools that have failed to perfom adequately but are now only too ready to criticise CTCs, such is their hostility towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause tidies up the arrangements and brings the CTCs within the funding provisions of the Bill. It is an unexceptional clause that we should all support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two brief points to raise. First, the real significance of the clause is that CTCs will no longer have a special relationship in terms of funding. Instead of their direct relationship with the Secretary of State, they will come within the remit of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1444</span>
funding agency. They will be funded in the same way as the grant-maintained sector. As a result of the new clause, CTCs and grant-maintained schools will eventually become one and the same thing. The mechanism will be in place to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CTC sector has not expanded—there will be 16 when the new college in Battersea gets off the ground, and not many more will be established. That rump of CTCs will soon be treated in exactly the same way as grant-maintained schools, except that they will have recognised expertise in technology. CTCs will be merged into the grain-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the auditing arrangements that will apply to CTCs. At the moment they are in a rather unusual situation. Although in many cases 90 per cent. of their funding is from public money, they are not subject to the usual rigorous auditing regime for such organisations. I hope that the Minister will explain the way in which he expects the monitoring and auditing of such expenditure of public money to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CTCs are in a special position at the moment because they have a direct relationship with the Secretary of State. Under the new regime, what will be the auditing arrangements? Before Christmas, the Government issued their consultation paper on the new common funding formula for grant-maintained schools. It indicated that funding for the grant-maintained sector would be regarded—for Treasury purposes—as part of local government expenditure. Will Treasury money for CTCs also be regarded as local government expenditure because of the new funding relationship with the funding agency, or will it still be regarded as being quite separate from it? It will be useful for the Committee to know how that funding will fit in with overall public expenditure.

The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was alarmed at the use of the phrase, "bribes". I think that the best description was the one given by the former Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)—now the Home Secretary—who said that they were not bribes, but were financial incentives. That is a good way of describing the way in which parents were encouraged to vote for, in particular, grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lessons are to be learnt about why CTCs are popular and oversubscribed. The Opposition would be very blinkered if we did not acknowledge that, for whatever reasons, CTCs are popular with parents. It is particularly interesting that they are popular, although their standards are not that great. The Opposition should learn why CTCs, in common with some local authority schools, are oversubscribed.

I hope that the Minister will answer my two specific questions about the auditing arrangements and whether the funding will be part of local government expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) say that CTCs are popular and oversubscribed because that is exactly the case. In my constituency of Erewash, there is a CTC in Derby and in Nottingham: both have proved to be attractive to children in the area. The Nottingham CTC has been established for some time and has met with considerable difficulties and hostility from the LEA—I should say from the Labour councillors on that LEA. In 1989, Nottinghamshire county council banned two

11-year-old girls from taking drama and music lessons because they attended the CTC. I hope that the hon. Member for Wallsend, who referred to the popularity of such colleges, will join with me in condemning that attitude in Nottingham and elsewhere in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it incredible that the hon. Lady can say such thing when, last week, she voted in favour of clause 244, which deals with the provision of goods and services by LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that we are not discussing clause 244 at the moment, but Conservative Members have always promoted choice and diversity in education and that clause provides just that. Choice and diversity have consistently been denied by Opposition Members through their actions against CTCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CTCs are popular with parents, pupils and teachers. When Derby CTC opened recently, it was oversubscribed and considerably more teachers applied for every vacant post than for those in any other school in the county. Derby and Nottingham CTCs were set up in parts of those cities which are not particularly prosperous. They are serving the more disadvantaged communities and are producing very good quality education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth who, sadly, is not present now, spoke about the TVI initiative of which I had considerable experience in my time as a member of Sheffield education authority. I am surprised that the Labour party fought that initiative and tried to prevent it being introduced. Only when it became an overwhelming success did the Labour party eventually, and reluctantly, scramble on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, when the CTC initiative was extended to provide opportunities for secondary schools, some schools that wanted to take advantage of those opportunities had to bid via Labour-controlled education authorities. Those authorities refused to allow the schools to bid for the money. That is another example of the Labour party denying opportunities to schools and pupils because of prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady confirm that the local authorities that did not submit bids were evenly divided between Labour and Conservative authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was a member of the Sheffield education authority, secondary schools wanted to bid for CTC initiative money to extend technology education in their schools but Labour-controlled Sheffield council refused to make the bid. The hon. Gentleman may cite a string of other examples, but Sheffield is a good example of a Labour LEA that physically prevented schools obtaining the money for initiatives in which they wished to participate. That is wrong, wherever it happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the technology college initiative will be extended. I look forward to visiting the Battersea college, which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea mentioned, once it is established. From my experience, I know that CTCs provide good, valuable education for the communities that they serve, and we shall promote the initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to contribute to the debate, but it has been interesting and has revealed the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1446</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said, no one would deny that there is some good teaching in CTCs and some handsome equipment. We are opposed to CTCs not because we think that everything that goes on in them is bad but because of their effect on the rest of education provision in the local authorities within that geographical area. Four times as much money is spent on every child who attends a CTC, as on a child in an LEA school. That is why they are popular with parents and teachers. Parents can see the range of CTCs' technological and other equipment, so it is no wonder that they want their children to attend them. Most teachers want to teach in well-equipped schools. It is no wonder that recruitment adverts attract many people who wish to teach in CTCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the future good health of our nation, Governments and local authorities should ensure an excellent standard of education in all schools, for all children. Conservative Members must accept that while CTCs have attracted so much capital from the Government, local authority schools have been starved of the money that they need to provide the same standard of education, especially through the provision of equipment and the maintenance of adequate pupil-teacher ratios. That worries the Opposition. For centuries, we have entrusted the future good health of the nation to an elite, in whom we have invested all our resources, and hoped that they would save us all and create wealth. But that has not happened. We should raise all standards—we owe that to every child. That cannot happen when, in allocating capital expenditure, we favour some schools at the expense of the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two Mondays ago, the capital moneys available to grant-maintained schools were announced. As a Birmingham Member of Parliament, I realised that £500,000 would be allocated to four grant-maintained schools, while the LEA received just over £6 million for the other 500-odd schools in the city. The allocation of capital moneys is the worst inequality in funding. The inequality in funding in favour of CTCs not only gives them an advantage, but more importantly, disadvantages other schools, which most children attend. I give way to the hon. Member for Battersea, who is itching to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady, as I can now stop itching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet again, the Opposition express the attitude, "If everybody can't have it, nobody should have it." That is difficult to understand. It is not surprising that technological equipment needs to be installed in technological colleges. That should be done well, and it costs money. If the technical high schools for which the Education Act 1944 provided, had remained, the hon. Member for Yardley would have complained about them. Investment would have continued in those schools. That investment will be made now and the hon. Lady should welcome it. She should join her hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend and recognise that CTCs are popular. She should be pleased that not only the taxpayer will pay for CTCs. They will attract new money from industry. She should wish them well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why Conservative Members speak about the technical schools of the 1944 Act. I was educated in Manchester, which had a genuinely tripartite system of grammar, technical and secondary modern schools. Pupils who had just failed to get into grammar schools attended technical schools. Those schools had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1447</span>
nothing to do with aptitude for technical subjects. They offered education that was slightly less academic than that of grammar schools and slightly more academic than that of secondary modern schools. They were not based on the same philosophy as CTCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All children have a right for their standards in technological and other subjects to be raised. National Government and local government have a duty to ensure equitable distribution of resources to enable that to happen. I accept that that point is often discussed, because it is a fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition want to enable all children to achieve the highest standards. The Government want to invest resources in a few, in the hope that they can save the nation. That is a fundamental difference and, thank heavens, we shall never resolve it. That is the choice faced by parents when they decide whether to vote for a party which believes in raising all standards or for one which believes in concentrating on the standards of a few.

The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not in the Room at the moment, asked whether I would join him in seeking finance to open a new CTC from an organisation such as Cadbury of Birmingham. I shall not. Will he join me in asking Cadbury whether it will restore some of the jobs, the loss of which it inflicted on the citizens of Birmingham last year? I should be worried if Cadbury could shell out money for schools which we do not need in Birmingham, because we have many surplus places, when it is making redundancies throughout the city, which has already suffered terribly from the economic recession. That example, along with the comments by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, shows the stupidity of relying on industry for investment in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want those who invest in education to have it as their first priority—those who promise to invest throughout the recession, the slump and the good times. To place the funding of our children's education in the hands of industrialists, who could withdraw that funding because their company is suffering seems foolhardy and not the way in which we should finance education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the debate, which has demonstrated that the Committee is continuing on its last day with the theme with which we are familiar—the profound conservatism of Opposition Members. Show them a new idea and their instinct is to shy away and oppose it, usually quite bitterly. They have obviously not been listening to the leader of the Labour party, because, over the weekend, he was enjoining Labour party members to examine new ideas, to think new thoughts and to boldly go where they had not dreamt of going before. His troops are sitting in Committee, harking back to the past and bitterly criticising one of the best and brightest new ideas for education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to emphasise the important issue raised by the Minister. 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> which has not been a great friend of Government economic policies recently published an editorial on 16 January 1993, which stated:
	<br><q><p>"At present the last place anybody would now turn to for a new idea is the Labour party."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That confirms what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1448</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to emphasise that we are not opposed to an initiative to highlight and strengthen technology in our schools. We are opposed to the mistake of the past to which my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley referred of providing excessive sums of money for a few pupils when a similar amount could be more effectively used elsewhere in the education system to achieve a better result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention reflects the other abiding desire of Opposition Members to throw as much taxpayers' money as possible, as indiscriminately as possible, at a system which is unable to produce consistently good results throughout the sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CTCs established several important aims. First, they acknowledged the need, particularly in inner cities, for a new factor in education to enable us to break out of the cycle of despair over which Labour authorities had presided for so long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can tell us why, if the emphasis is on the inner city, the Government dropped those words from the title of those colleges and now refer to city technology colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, those establishments were always called city technology colleges. If the hon. Gentleman is hung up on names and titles, such changes reflect our flexibility in moving with the times. That is something that the hon. Gentleman is incapable of doing and which he seems to find unacceptable, even when it surfaces in such a minor example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that everyone would welcome CTCs but apparently Opposition Members cannot bring themselves to welcome a new institution for the inner cities—about which I would have thought that Opposition Members would be concerned—which has a different basis for its funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can sense from the tone of remarks made by Opposition Members that the idea that really gets to them is that we should turn to the business community and say, "Are you interested in contributing to an exciting new idea in education, which will strengthen the links between business and education?" Lamentably, over many years, that link has not been strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several businesses and individuals have contributed with great generosity of spirit to the development of CTCs. How do Opposition Members respond? They are either critical or they sneer at the development as highly undesirable. I am not angered but saddened by that reaction. Philanthropists and businesses have said that they want to contribute to education and to help to bring the worlds of education and industry closer together. I would have thought that that willingness was of the greatest importance, but that was another idea to which Opposition Members could not subscribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be the glimmerings of common ground concerning the emphasis on science and technology. Most members of the Committee acknowledge that that aspect has been neglected for some time and most can empathise about that matter in their different ways. CTCs offered a new, important experimental means of bringing science and technology more effectively and strongly to a specific group of young people. That was the genesis of the idea. CTCs were about inner cities, science and technology and the partnership between business and education. One would have thought that that idea would have grasped the imagination of everyone involved in education. However,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1449</span>
Opposition Members do not like the idea because, I suspect, they think that it is another example of something slightly different from the monotonous grey of LEA education provision, above which Opposition Members cannot lift their eyes. That is the fundamental difficulty that we have faced throughout the Committee's proceedings and which we face today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's reaction to criticism, which has been expressed by many hon. Members, that, while it is true that CTCs were established as an experiment—in the Minister's words—to ensure that science and technology is brought more effectively to a specific group of pupils, there is much evidence that they have not been especially successful in achieving that aim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to respond to that criticism later, but I shall gladly do so now. It is another example of the regrettable differences in opinion that members of the Committee have on this matter. Such institutions are still relatively new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable to suppose that CTCs will take some time to get into their stride, to overcome their newness and to establish an institutional framework and a style of their own. Only one CTC—Kingshurst—has so far received a full inspection, and that was in 1990, when it had been open for one year only. I hasten to add that all CTCs will be inspected by Ofsted under the new cycle of inspections. We should hesitate before rushing to judge the entire CTC community on the basis of one inspection that was carried out in 1990. Even that inspection pointed out that an excellent and sound learning environment was being developed in that CTC. The report went on to criticise the treatment of some subjects, but I do not find that criticism shocking, unusual or abnormal. Of course one would have preferred that CTC to have developed immediately a much higher standard right across the subject range. I think, however, that that would have been unlikely, especially when one considers the background to CTC development, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon). He said that the CTC in his constituency had been based on a secondary school that had not been doing at all well. That CTC is now popular, thriving and oversubscribed. That is a good example of the kind of transformation that can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the Minister's response to the argument on CTCs, but he referred earlier to the monotonously grey provision of local education authorities. His Department funds many LEAs that are exploring significant and exciting new educational ground. The Minister's generalisation is unacceptable in an examination of the work of many LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can partly accept what the hon. Gentleman says. My characterisation may have been too harsh, but I was trying to make a comparison between the facility for experimentation that CTCs exemplify and the tendency of LEAs towards a standardised approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the over-prescriptive curriculum is doing precisely what he is criticising? It is producing a drab greyness from the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective of the curriculum is to ensure that each child receives a basic minimum coverage of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1450</span>
subjects to an acceptable standard, but there is still scope for great variety and the grant-maintained sector is a good example of what can and will be provided within the state system. CTCs are another example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend asked about auditing. CTCs are required to appoint external auditors, whose reports are monitored by my Department. In that regard, they are on all fours with grant-maintained schools. There is no question of CTCS not being properly and externally audited or of their finances not being available to the gaze of my Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware of the alarm caused by the fact that grant-maintained schools and CTCs can appoint their own auditors. Will he consider adopting the policy that applies to national health service trusts under which independent auditors are appointed by the Audit Commission? That would introduce some monitoring and supervision, which will not exist if CTCs can appoint their own auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. We are familiar with a system in which companies in the private sector, grant-maintained schools, CTCs and so on are free to choose their own professionally qualified auditors, who then carry out an external audit and report accordingly. There is no problem with that and it strengthens the responsibility of grant-maintained schools and CTCs for making their own arrangements within an acceptable framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How, then, will the Minister safeguard against the fraud that occurs so widely under the existing system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it does in Lambeth and similar LEAs. Fraud is always a problem—in LEAs as elsewhere. Mechanisms exist to deal with that but they do not always work, as happened, regrettably, in Lambeth. We shall make the best possible provision and I am sure that a joint objective of all members of the Committee is to be satisfied that the financial checks and auditing arrangements for LEAs, colleges, grant-maintained schools and so on work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that the National Audit Office has recently investigated the auditing arrangements in grant-maintained schools and CTCs and that it will come forward with recommendations shortly. Will the Minister agree to include those recommendations in the Bill at a later stage, whatever they might be, bearing in mind the role and responsibility of the National Audit Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. However great my respect and admiration for the National Audit Office, it would be foolish to make a commitment to incorporate that in the Bill in advance of seeing the text. We are legislating, not playing games. This is the process of making a statute. I am sure that the hon. Member for Wallsend would expect me to consider carefully whether the contents of the report have a bearing on, and are relevant to, the Bill and whether I should at a subsequent stage, recommend changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend. If the NAO were to recommend that grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges should be subject to similar
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1451</span>
provisions on auditing as national health service trusts, would not the Minister be obliged to accept its recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not. I would want to examine the extent to which there was a parallel between the different bodies. I am not convinced that that parallel exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, on an earlier occasion, he said that the funding agency for schools would be audited through the NAO? Is not it a requirement of non-departmental public bodies to be audited in such a way? Why shall that not apply to grant-maintained schools and city technological colleges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the provisions and status of the bodies are different. Grant-maintained schools, for example, will be incorporated, which will give them independence of operation. We are giving them new responsibilities. They will have a separate existence from, for example, the funding agency for schools, which will have a different mechanism and which will be a different body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making slightly heavy weather of this. All we are saying is that audit arrangements for different bodies might have to be different. We want to be satisfied that the audit arrangements are transparent and workable. I believe that that is the case. I shall consider new evidence, such as the NAO report, and make an assessment as to whether I shall recommend changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the general background. The new clause which I commend to the Committee, is undramatic. It would make arrangements whereby, should the Secretary of State consider it reasonable, he would be able to ask the funding agency for schools to take on the function of making payments to CTCs. Its aims are modest. It would not change the basis on which CTCs are funded. To answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Wallsend, that will continue to be separate from the LEA provision. It will continue to be by formula and to reflect the historic expenditure of the host LEA, and it will be distributed on a pupil basis. There may be adjustments for higher London costs in, for example, the case of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the consultation on the common funding formula, is it not the intention that the method of funding grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges will eventually be brought into line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that we can make that judgment at this stage. CTCs are different animals. They are designed for a different purpose, operate on a different basis and swim in different waters. I do not think that it is self-evident, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, that the basis of funding for CTCs should move in the same direction as that for grant-maintained schools. It may or may not, but that is not an immediate concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the new clause would establish the same mechanism for the funding of CTCs as applies to the funding of the grant-maintained sector? Will he accept that, because CTCs are funded in the same way, the option will be open—in the near future, if the Bill becomes law—to treat CTCs in the same way as grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are going up a blind alley. If the Secretary of State judges that CTCs should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1452</span>
funded on the same basis as grant-maintained schools, he can achieve that whether or not the funding agency for schools is involved. That is not the key factor in the equation. That could be decided on a different basis, for policy reasons. My Department could continue to fund CTCs directly, but on a formula similar to that for funding grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, later today, we shall discuss new clause 50, which refers to the agenda for new school governors. That need not be introduced in the Bill. The Secretary of State could have introduced that by regulation, but, for political reasons, he included it in the Bill. The same could be argued in relation to new clause 22. Therefore, we are trying to discover the real reason for the new clause. Many of us think that, because there will be a rump of CTCs—approximately 16 and certainly no more than 20—they will soon be incorporated into the grant-maintained school sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that Opposition Members are looking for what, in the olden days, and in a different context, used to be called "Reds under the bed". There are none. With new clause 22, what you see is what you get. It provides for a straightforward, although, perhaps, somewhat mechanistic arrangement. We suggest that it would make sense, or may make sense some time in the future, for the Secretary of State to be able to ask the funding agency for schools to take on the task of funding city technology colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered most of the questions asked by Opposition Members and by my hon. Friends. We have dealt with the principles on which CTCs were set up and we have aired the differences between the parties on that. I hope that I have satisfied the Committee that the new clause is a straightforward and simple way to provide for a possibility of a new mechanism for making payments to CTCs. On that basis, I recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for clearly answering all the questions that have been raised. In responding to the debate, he has set out the agenda for the future. Although the aims of the new clause are simple and straightforward, nevertheless, in the medium term, it could have implications for absorbing CTCs into the grant-maintained system. The Minister has assured us that that is not the purpose of the clause and that grant-maintained schools and CTCs will be funded in completely different ways even if the Secretary of State wishes to give the funding agency responsibility for handling the money. I thank the Minister for his response to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is important but relatively straightforward. It provides for the Secretary of State to bring forward in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1454</span>
regulations a requirement that a proportion of the annual maintenance grant for a school in a group or cluster must be spent for the purposes to which it relates. We envisage that there will be a requirement that a proportion of the funds will go to the individual schools in the cluster but that normally an element of the funding will be held centrally by the cluster of schools for their common purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will regard the clause as a reassurance to schools that are contemplating joining together in a group or cluster. It will oblige the governing body to spend the bulk of the funding relating directly to the school, and the prescribed proportion will be by far the larger part of the funds. However, we recognise that there is a possibility that the governing body may wish to spend some of the money on large pieces of equipment, for example, which it would make sense to buy centrally and from which all the schools in the cluster could benefit. As another example, the governing body may wish to purchase professional services, such as professional development courses, which would benefit all teachers and staff. However, that would happen in the context of the requirement that the overall budget would have to be spent for the purposes of schools in the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a development of the cluster principle and tackles some of the detail of the matter. It is likely that the Secretary of State will wish to bring forward regulations that will reassure schools that they need not worry that the apportionment of funds at school level will be unfair or disproportionate just because they may be out voted on the governing body of a cluster. The new clause is a mechanism to guard against that. I hope that the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the new clause because I know that schools are worried about the managerial and financial practicalities of clustering. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the clause will help to reassure schools on that score and thus encourage as many of the smaller schools as possible to become grant maintained. It would be interesting to know whether he has has any further thoughts about the possibility that a secondary school and its duckling primary schools could become a cluster. Would there need to be any changes in the funding proposals in that case? I have a strong interest in special schools, and the provision relating to expensive equipment would be of great help to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful also if my hon. Friend would say whether schools would be free to share bursars and managerial requirements. A small school will not need a full-time bursar or manager, but a cluster of such schools could pool their managerial resources. That should not be overlooked, given that freedom of management is one of the benefits associated with grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between bureaucracy and management: the former stifles results, the latter gets them.

I welcome the new clause, but hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to the questions that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although Opposition Members oppose the principle of clusters of grant-maintained schools, the new clause's proposals for the administrative arrangements are sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not the greatest supporter of clusters, as my hon. Friend the Minister has accepted with his usual grace and good humour. The new clause's administrative purpose is reasonably sensible but, given that all the head teachers of the schools in a cluster will not serve on the governing body, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that all the head teachers will be expected to take part in the discussion of grant allocation. Otherwise, there is a danger that the head teacher in situ on a governing body will have a greater say on behalf of his or her school than other heads. There could be differences of opinion about whether grant should be allocated on a per pupil or per school basis. Therefore, it would be helpful if there were an expectation that all the head teachers in a cluster would be party to such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the expressions of support for the clause. I was tempted, during that brief exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) and Opposition Members, to muse on whether management could be defined as profit responsible and bureaucrats as taxpayer accountable. However fascinating that may be, it is not a subject for today. We may return to it under a different guise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have rightly identified that this relatively modest but important provision is designed to give reassurances to schools that are to take up the opportunities available to them in the parts of the Bill that provide for schools to form groups or clusters. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea that I must assume that when schools freely agree to form a group, they will be doing so in a spirit of co-operation, not of mutual hostility. Therefore, there is the expectation that they will work co-operatively and in harmony. There may, of course, be differences of view about how to allocate funds, but we should assume that they will agree fairly readily. Equally, it would be sensible if they consulted the head teachers at every stage of developing their modus operandi, financial arrangements and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye more about how much further our thoughts have developed on the matters that we discussed previously. The provisions in the new clause will be helpful, but they will complicate matters. As I told my hon. Friend, funding must be borne in mind when considering secondary and primary schools or special school clusters. It is relatively easy to calculate a framework or formulation for an all-primary cluster but it is more complicated when secondary or special schools are involved. At present, I envisage the provision applying to all primary clusters. We shall have to consider how the clause's regulations may be framed to take account of the developments that we discussed and broadly agreed in principle but have yet to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can be reassured that this modest measure will be used by the Secretary of State simply to provide a proper mechanism and safeguards for those schools that want to take up the option to form clusters. I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will consider the clause an important addition to parents' rights. The Education Act 1980 provided for appeal committees established by LEAs to be within the jurisdiction of the Commission for Local Administration, but it did not extend the CLA's jurisdiction to appeal committees established by aided, and special agreement schools and appeal committees established by grant-maintained schools are also outside the CLA's jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its response to the citizens charter last year, the CLA argued that parents of children attending or wishing to attend aided, special agreement and grant-maintained schools have no ready means of redress for any injustice that may have been caused by an appeal committee's errors. It argued that its jurisdiction should be extended to appeal committees established by the governing bodies of those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers in my Department and in the Department of the Environment, which is responsible for funding the CLA, have carefully considered the CLA's arguments. Consultations were held last October with various interested religious organisations such as the Catholic Education Service. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of County Councils and the Standing Advisory Committee for Grant-maintained Schools were also consulted. All who were consulted welcomed the new clause—a press notice at the time of consultation made the public aware of the Government's thoughts on the matter—and agreed that the appeal committees concerned should be added to the list of bodies whose action the commission is empowered to investigate. The proposed extension of the CLA's jurisdiction would be a useful step which would genuinely enhance parent's rights and would be entirely consistent with the citizens and parents charters.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the new clause, about which I have only one question. Will the local government ombudsman's remit include all areas in which governing bodies have responsibility but for which the LEA would have responsibility if the school were a county, voluntary, controlled or special one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the answer is that when there is an identifiable appeal mechanism, for example, on admissions and exclusions, the commission will be able to be involved. The remit will apply only in those areas, and not more generally. The idea is to give further recourse to those who are dissatisfied with the working of the appeal mechanism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if a parent complained about an accident suffered by a child while using a piece of equipment in a gymnasium and the matter was not satisfactorily dealt with by the school's governors? What recourse would the parents have if the local government ombudsman were unable to consider the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the school was an LEA one, the parent would have recourse to the LEA. In the rare case of a grant-maintained school's governing body being unable to satisfy the parents, they would have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State. The overriding responsibility of the authority and that of the Secretary of State will always remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to give the impression that the clause provides an all-embracing, comprehensive mechanism to deal with parents' dissatisfaction with the education system. It is designed to be restricted to areas where an established appeal mechanism exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the proposal is modest but important and that the Committee should consider it. I welcome the Government's change of heart. During discussions about the Education Reform Act 1988, the Commissioner for Local Administration made it clear that he wanted the power to intervene in the event of maladministration. Local authorities thought that the ombudsman's power should be extended to cover the sort of appeal committees that we are now considering. The Government refused any amendments to the 1988 Act which would have allowed that to happen. In the other place the Government's response was clear. They stated that grant-maintained schools were not part of local government and that
	<br><q><p>"it is surely obvious that the Commissioner for Local Administration's writ should not run here."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 June 1988; Vol. 498, c. 1031.]</p></q>
That was the Government's view just five years ago. Now they have done a U-turn and said that, although grant-maintained schools are not part of local government, the writ of the local authority ombudsman should extend to the appeal committees. It would be interesting to learn why the Government have had such a change of heart. I believe that there are two reasons, one of which is the massive dissatisfaction felt by parents who have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1462</span>
denied the school of their choice. Those parents have appealed to an appeals committee and have been told that their children cannot go to the school of their choice and there is no one to whom they can further appeal because of the way in which the system operates. In Hillingdon, Kent and Bromley, parental dissatisfaction is obvious. That is why the Government have decided to extend the power of the local government ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On exclusions from schools, the Minister has continually refused to answer my parliamentary questions about how many pupils are being excluded from grant-maintained schools. He said that it was inappropriate to disclose that sort of information. Will the Minister confirm that there have been 30 exclusions from Audenshaw school—to consider just one grant-maintained school—during the past 18 months? A system of appeal to a local government ombudsman needs to be introduced so that parents can appeal to an independent third party. That illustrates how the freedom that was once a great attraction of grant-maintained status is slowly being eroded. When the Bill's effect on grant-maintained schools becomes clear, it will be seen that their freedom has been fundamentally diminished. Decisions about local authority services, exclusions and admissions will be subject to the opinion of an independent third party. I welcome that, but it is a significant change of direction by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have an unusual number of bees in his bonnet this morning. I must try to assist him in easing his discomfort. Yet again, he has the gall to criticise the Government for having the audacity to change their mind. He has obviously not listened to his leader's speech. I must obtain a text of that speech and give it to the hon. Gentleman sometime before the Committee resumes this afternoon because it has not sunk in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, the Leader of the Opposition said that members of his party—I assume that the hon. Member for Wallsend still claims to be one—should be flexible and that they should consider options and possibilities. Yet I am being criticised for my flexibility and pragmatism. I plead guilty to the fact that, sometime between 1988 and now, we considered developments in the grant-maintained sector and decided that we should arrange things slightly differently. I confess that I am guilty of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, whoever occupies my position and the Secretary of State—who presides benignly over our education system at present, and who, no doubt, will continue to do so by popular demand—will take a different view as the grant-maintained sector develops and prospers. The thinking of Opposition Members is so hidebound that they seem to suppose that a change of policy is something of which to be ashamed. I can tell the hon. Lady that the success of my party in four successive elections has been due in no small part to our ability to move with the times and to make appropriate changes in policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend said that massive dissatisfaction over admissions exists among parents. The truth is that there will always be a few parents who, because they cannot get their first choice of school, will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1463</span>
disappointed. If they cannot prevail in the appeals mechanism, they will be further disappointed. I regret that that will always be the case. I doubt that we shall ever be able to reach a stage in the state education system where all parents will achieve their first preference. I hope that, one day, we shall have raised the standard of performance and excellence so far that we shall be able to achieve that but I think that that is a way off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that part of the dissatisfaction arises from the fact that, in the borough of Bromley, to my knowledge, several parents were not given even their fifth choice and that a matter of weeks before term started in September, they did not know to which school their children would be allocated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that there have been problems in Bromley and in Hillingdon. My latest information is that, due to co-operation between the authority and the schools, procedures have been developed which will eliminate most of last year's problems. Again, the solution is co-operation in education; LEAs must work with grant-maintained schools to establish how best to manage admissions policies and to maximise the expression of preference for parents. That process will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend asked me about the number of children excluded from schools. That issue has been dealt with in passing but, with your indulgence, Sir John, I shall answer the hon. Gentleman. I recently had a consultation paper on that important subject, with which I am anxious to deal properly. I want to ensure that I am aware of the views of authorities and schools. If I have not already told the Committee, I shall tell it openly that I am not satisfied that we know enough about what is happening in schools and authorities with excluded pupils. I do not know how large the number of exclusions is, nor why exclusions take place. I am certainly not satisfied that those young people who are excluded from schools are receiving proper, alternative education provision. That must be the most important factor. Reasons for exclusion are important and each exclusion is a tragedy. I want to strike a balance between minimising their number and acknowledging the right of head teachers to make that difficult decision when they think that it would be best for the school. One of the most important results of the consultation will be to identify how to provide education for those young people who are excluded from mainstream schools. That is my objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot at the moment give the hon. Member for Wallsend a detailed answer. I hope that I shall be better placed so to do when I have examined the results of the consultation, which were finalised about 10 days ago. I have no reason to believe that there are more exclusions from grant-maintained schools, but I do not want to prejudge the issue.

The new clause empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations where appropriate to require secondary schools to make available the information that further education institutions will be required to publish. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that information about further education institutions, and in particular their examination results, is made available in schools for 15-year-old pupils and their parents who are considering post-16 options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policies to increase participation in post-16 education and training and to raise levels of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1466</span>
achievement depend on 15-year-olds being able to make a rational and informed choice of post-16 options.

I accept, at least in part, that the question that the hon. Member for Bridgend asked me about new clause 43 applies equally to new clause 44.

I am glad that subsection(2) includes grant-maintained special schools and maintained schools. Independent special schools want those parents who prefer their children to have the option of using such schools to have access to information about them. There is also the question of whether parents can have access to information about special schools if their children are already at a secondary school. My interpretation of the new clause is that it provides that access to information about special schools should be given by the governing body of any school providing "primary" education. In my constituency, there is a case of a child who has received her education in the maintained secondary school, has not done well and needs to go to a special school. It has been extremely difficult for her parent to find out the necessary information. Would secondary schools be under a similar obligation to provide information to parents about the provision of all sorts of special schools, be they maintained, non-maintained or grant-maintained?

The proposal of annual consideration of whether to ballot parents will ensure that parents are kept fully informed about the governing body's thinking on this important issue. We have always made our policy on grant-maintained status clear. Parents should have the opportunity to seek grant-maintained status for their children's schools. The new clause, which I commend, will ensure that parents, who ultimately make the decision, will know the views of the governing bodies of their children's schools. They have a right to know that the issue of grant-maintained status is properly considered each year, and they should have an opportunity to make their views known. Until now, there have been occasional problems where a governing body has not demonstrated that it is preprared to examine seriously the alternative of grant-maintained status for the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I do not wish to excite the Opposition unduly. The proposal is modest and straightforward. It would ensure that governing bodies considered grant-maintained status and reported their conclusions to parents in the schools' annual reports. Those deliberations should take place once a year because circumstances are likely to change in an area as well as in a school. For example, other schools may become grant-maintained, the LEA may chaange its views, or even its composition. It is sensible for schools to examine the issue regularly and report to parents. The new clause would ensure that that happened. It requires no further explanation. I hope that the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I discuss the new clause, I draw the Committee's attention to the Secretary of State's announcement on the issue to 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> on 31

January. Is that a new way of informing Members of Parliament about impending legislation? It is not democratic. When I woke up this morning and heard the Secretary of State on Radio 4, I listened carefully in case he announced more new clauses or proposed legislation. It is more appropriate to make announcements to the Committee than to 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> or on "Jimmy Young".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition received notice of the new clause only yesterday. Emphasis on "democracy" would be more appropriate than the emphasis that the Government place on "diversity". The Bill would have been different if the word "democracy" had been included in the title.

We oppose the new clause because it will cause total upheaval in governing bodies and schools throughout the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1470</span>
country. The debate has revealed the controversy that surrounds grant-maintained status. Parents feel strongly about matters that affect their children's education. If the new clause is accepted, they will be bound to lobby governors to hold meetings and circulate bits of paper. The ensuing chaos—not confusion—will be devastating for many schools. The exercise set out in the new clause will be time consuming and will prevent governing bodies from discussing anything but grant-maintained status for at least one term out of three. Furthermore, it will be costly in terms of resources, because meetings will have to be held and information distributed.
