	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to clause 28. I have exceptionally accepted two starred amendments to the clause in the name of the hon. Member for Dewsbury and her colleagues. I understand that they should have appeared unstarred, but failed, by accident, to do so. They are Nos. 466 and 467, which I have grouped together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 28</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH PROPOSALS FOR ACQUISITION OF GRANT-MAINTAINED STATUS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 466, in page 14, line 29, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'provided that no such expenditure incurred under subsection (6) of Section 20 exceeds the limit set out in subsection (3) below.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 467, in page 14, line 32, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) A local education authority who have received from a governing body written notice under section 17 or section 18 of this Act that a ballot is to be held under section 20 of this Act shall neither pay any sum nor incur any expense for the purpose of influencing the outcome of that ballot in excess of such maximum amount as may be prescribed.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28(3) provides for restricting the amount of money that a LEA can spend on activities that relate to ballot about grant-maintained status. It sets out an aggregate sum of money that a LEA cannot exceed in any year. I presume that, at the beginning of every year, the Secretary of State will specify to each LEA a sum of money, which will later be capped. LEAs will be unable to exceed that figure in providing information about grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While accepting the principle of restricting the amount of money that a LEA can spend on information when an opt-out ballot is held, the amendments would provide a more practical method of achieving that. They would link LEA spending on information with the amount of money spent by individual school governing bodies. The amendments would provide that, if an opt-out ballot takes place, the Secretary of State will grant an earmarked sum of money for the governing body to spend on information. The LEA will be allowed to spend the same amount of money on information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are a more practical method of achieving the Government's political objective of restricting the amount of money that LEAs can spend on information. Some of us would question whether LEAs
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
have spent a lot of money on the process. However, the Government believe that that has happened. We dispute the fact that there has been abuse, but we acknowledge that such a view has been taken. We are trying to put forward a more practical way to limit the amount of money that can be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of clause 28 causes great difficulty and raises the question of the way in which the aggregate money will be calculated. It will often be difficult and certainly unpredictable to calculate a year in advance exactly how many ballots there will be in an LEA area. In my own LEA authority of north Tyneside, the Government might say that £25,000 is a reasonable amount of money, but there has been only one parental ballot to opt out. In Kent or Essex, where there have been many parental ballots, obviously a different figure would have to be calculated. How would the Secretary of State calculate the aggregate figure in clause 28(3)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it not be far better to adopt the approach taken in the two amendments? The balloting process would be studied and once the school began to ballot, that would be the time to say that the school could spend a certain amount of money and the LEA could spend the same. A fair formula could be worked out: if the school had 1,200 pupils, 50p per pupil could be spent, so that each side of the argument could spend a maximum of £600 as part of the process of providing the information. A simple formula could be devised, which would allow both parties to express their views and provide the information to the parents within an amount set down by the Secretary of State, through the amended clause 28. The amendments provide a simple, practical and effective method of achieving the Government's objectives of restricting LEA expenditure on the provision of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit that the wording of the amendments is not original. The Opposition have taken it from Government legislation—the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 1989. That Act puts a similar restriction on LEA expenditure during the balloting process and section 17 provides the same formula for restricting local authority expenditure as in these two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is good enough for Scotland is good enough for us. As clause 28 is presently worded, it will be almost unworkable in terms of the Secretary of State providing a global figure for an LEA well in advance of the period for which it will be effective. The figure will be unpredictable and it will be difficult to calculate how many schools will be balloting. The formula that the Government proposed in the 1989 Act as it affects Scotland would be a far better way to carry forward the stated intention of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for some reason, the Minister feels unable to accept the amendments, we shall be listening carefully to hear why the formula that was acceptable in the 1989 Act for Scotland is not acceptable for a Bill affecting England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, the argument for the amendments is seductive but it is not well-founded, despite the claims of the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers). The fairly obvious reason comes down to economics. I do not expect Opposition Members to understand it too well, but I shall do my best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities can reap the economies of scale—I suspect that I have lost most Opposition Members already—because they can produce material in bulk and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
relatively cheaply for the ballots held by different schools. That was suggested by some Opposition Members—semi-facetiously in one case—but the principle stands. Each school must produce its own materials in the course of the balloting procedure, so the level playing field so ingeniously suggested by the hon. Member for Wallsend may not be so level after all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a formulation to take account of that inegality. The parity at which the amendment is aimed would seem to produce a level playing field, but in practice it would do nothing of the kind. This part of the Bill aims to place reasonable limits on what LEAs are able to do and to facilitate as far as is possible the provision of proper information to parents by school governors, so any result such as I believe that the amendment would produce would be unfair in the way that I have described. The playing field would be tilted—ingeniously, but unfairly—against schools. That is the flaw in the amendment. I hope that all hon. Members share my wish for as much parity as can be achieved in the circumstances—I concede that, given the nature of the players, exact parity would be difficult to achieve. However, although the hon. Member for Wallsend, as ever, presented his clever amendment smoothly, it will not do. Without wishing to overstate the matter, I fear that it may undermine the true purpose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being called smooth by the Minister is certainly a compliment. However, two matters must be dealt with before the Minister sits down. First, clause 28 refers to the "prescribed amount" for each LEA. How will that amount be calculated? What factors will the Secretary of State take into account?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the wider issue of information from the LEA, the Local Government Act 1986 lays down strict requirements about the nature of information that local authorities, including LEAs, may give to people in their areas. Do not the provisions of that Act cover the points raised by the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the second question, it is not the nature of the information as much as its volume that is relevant here. The Bill would ensure that the amount of information is reasonable, regardless, for the moment, of its content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend, not unreasonably, asked about the "prescribed amount". I envisage that, in due course, a consultation document will be produced outlining some possible different approaches to the problem which will draw on the Scottish experience Inevitably, however, the formulation will have some regard to a basic amount allowable, plus an amount per school that could be adjusted according to the number of pupils per school. There would be an attempt to take account of the authority and its nature, the number of schools involved and the number of pupils in the schools. The approach should probably be along those lines, but I do not want to pre-empt the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department for Education will approach the matter, as ever, cautiously and carefully, by consulting, listening and moving towards a consensual system of a kind with which members of the Committee will be familiar. I cannot answer the hon. Member for Wallsend in detail, but I should have thought that such a general approach would commend itself to the Committee. I shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>
have to ask the Committee to bear with me. I do not think instant answers will be expected from me at this stage. The objectives are laid out in clause 28. Consultation will follow. We shall then put together a formula which, I believe, will achieve the objectives of the clause. The amendments would undermine those objectives, which is why I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's response. He should have dealt with several important issues in replying to the debate, which was very brief. He referred to economies of scale. I think I was with his argument at that point—had he gone much further into the economic debate I might have had some difficulty. I understand the economies of scale argument. Probably one of the best examples of the use of economies of scale is his own Department's use of massively increased publicity budget in the past few years to issue the kind of booklet that was paraded before the Committee earlier today. That booklet, which sets out how schools can become grant-maintained was produced by the thousand by the Minister's Department. No local education authority is spending at such a level. There have been mailshots to chairs of governing bodies, advocating the benefits of grant-maintained status and letters to head teachers of schools arguing the case. Those are the economies of scale operated by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects to this pair of amendments. Amendment No. 466 would provide equality of spending between the school governing body and the local education authority. The important factor provided by amendment No. 467 is that the limit will apply to individual ballots. Both sides would then be restricted in relation to individual ballots. The Government's stated intention is to restrict expenditure on information by a local education authority, and that is most crucial in relation to ballots at schools. To parents, it is the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of opting out for their school which are most important. The amendments would limit expenditure in that context. They go no further. They would lay down merely that if Wallsend high school—there is no such school—is balloting to opt out, the high school can spend £600 on its campaign and the local authority can spend £600 on its.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister is unable to accept the amendments. We have taken the wording produced by the Government two years ago in the 1989 Act in Scotland. I do not know of any examples of abuse resulting from that legislation, which seems to have worked effectively. Can the Minister give examples of how it has not worked effectively? I can think of none and I doubt that he can. It is a workable system that has stood the test of two or three years, it seems to be fair and it has merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister feels unable to respond positively. We may return to the issue later, perhaps on Report, but for the moment I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause, in isolation from what is happening in practice, tries, as the Minister said, to provide a level playing field between the local education authority and the individual school governing bodies in its area. It ignores totally the power of the Minister's Department to use its publicity budget to promote the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
cause of the grant-maintained school sector—although it has failed recently in that endeavour with more and more schools saying no to grant-maintained status when they have been balloted. In the one school in north Tyneside that held a ballot, the parents voted against seeking grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were wise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree. The Minister's Department has, often in subtle ways, provided public money for partisan campaigning in support of opting out, which, of course, is a total misuse of such funds. However, the clause covers only the relationship between the local authority and individual school governing bodies. It ignores not just the Department's spending, but the effective laundering of public money, voted for by the House, to organisations established ostensibly to advise parents and schools on grant-maintained status, but which campaign specifically in support of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the £760,000 that the Government are giving this year to the Grant Maintained Schools Centre, which was known originally as the Grant Maintained Schools Trust. It was set up in 1988, at the time of the Education Reform Act 1988, by the now hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris). At that time he was not a Member of Parliament. He was such a great man that the people of Oxford, East had voted him out of office in the 1987 general election. However, it was second time lucky for him when the people of Epping Forest elected him at a by-election a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest was responsible for establishing the Grant Maintained Schools Trust in 1988 for the purpose of advocating grant-maintained status for schools. It was to advise schools that wanted to become grant maintained and to campaign for the view that such status was the correct way forward. The organisation sought public funding, but was denied by the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley, because part of its remit was to campaign and as the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, campaigning would be a misuse of public money. It applied also in 1988 for charitable status, which was refused by the charity commissioners because of its partisan nature and campaigning activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of those two refusals, the Grant Maintained Schools Trust split into two apparently separate organisations. The Grant Maintained Schools Centre was specifically set up with a narrow remit, which was to advise schools that had already voted for grant-maintained status and had had their applications approved by the Secretary of State. Once that process had been completed, the Grant Maintained Schools Centre could give advice on establishing a grant-maintained school. On that basis, the House voted public money to support the Grant Maintained Schools Centre because it was no longer involved in campaigning. A separate body called Choice in Education was set up alongside it. It still exists. Choice in Education clearly and proudly states that its role is to campaign for grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grant Maintained Schools Centre is funded by the public purse. It offers advice and, following the division, was successful in applying for charitable status because it is un-political and un-partisan. Choice in Education was set up to campaign and to be partisan. The two organisations are effectively one and the same. Their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
annual company returns show that they operate from the same registered office at 36 Great Smith street, London SW1. It is interesting that the annual company return for Choice in Education—the campaigning body—is certified by Sir Robert Balchin, chairman of the Grant Maintained Schools Centre. The telephone number to which Companies house should direct inquiries about information in Choice in Education's return is the same as that used by the Grant Maintained Schools Centre. That is particularly worthy of note, as are the directors of Choice in Education, half of whom are also directors of the Grant Maintained Schools Centre: Sir Robert Balchin, Sir Christopher Lawson and Lawrence Norcross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grant Maintained Schools Centre will receive more than £750,000 of public money in this financial year, and yet it allows its telephone to be used by Choice in Education and has a chairman who is also chairman of Choice in Education. It is clearly nothing more than a Tory front organisation for laundering money in Choice in Education. All of the key players—Sir Robert Balchin, Sir Christopher Lawson and Andrew Turner, head of Choice in Education—have one thing in common: they used to work for Conservative central office. There has been abuse and misuse of public money on a grand scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that there is an abuse of public money. If there were any impropriety, the Select Committee on Public Accounts would be on it like a ton of bricks and the media would seize on it. It has not happened. The hon. Gentleman seeks to make bricks without straw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. On Monday, I wrote to the National Audit Office to set in train the investigation that needs to be held so that a report can be sent to the Public Accounts committee. Because the information is prima facie, the charity commissioners have been invited to investigate whether there has been a breach of charitable status by the Grant Maintained Schools Centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the information that the hon. Gentleman has now provided, does he not agree that it would have been far better to have made his allegations after the investigation than to anticipate the findings of any report? The hon. Gentleman is being premature and grossly unfair. He is slandering some truly good men who are anxious to promote a reasonable idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the Government not imposed a guillotine on the Bill, we might have had the time to obtain the information before debating clause 28. Because of the timetable motion, which the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth supported with such enthusiasm, we are debating clause 28 this evening without having yet received a response from the National Audit Office or the charity commissioners to the invitation to conduct an investigation into the potential misuse of public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is relevant to clause 28, which introduces restrictions on local education authority expenditure. However, there is no attempt to deal with the massive increase in spending on publicity by the Minister's Department or the misuse of public funds by

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too much to bear to hear the hon. Gentleman speak of the misuse of public funds, especially regarding education. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Register of Members' Interests dated 1 December 1992. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) says in his declaration:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Office provided rent and rate free from Sheffield City Council."</p></blockquote>
So Sheffield, that well-known authority which spends so much on education, subsidises the office of a local Labour Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No hon. Gentleman should be accused of being involved in the misuse of public funds. I ask the hon. Gentleman to make another point to highlight his case. I am very uneasy about an hon. Gentleman who is not a member of the Committee, and therefore unable to defend himself, being accused of any such involvement. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was accusing him, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is questionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had a quick look through the Register of Members' Interests. The most interesting entry was that of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), who is a consultant to the National Bed Federation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to make important points about how the Department's publicity budget is being used and about the activities of the Grant Maintained Schools Centre. Surely the Minister should put his own house in order before trying to restrict the legitimate activities of democratically elected local education authorities. Clause 28 is a further restriction on what they can do. The Minister should look more carefully to his own budget and to the work of the Grant Maintained Schools Centre. That is where the real abuse is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, clause 28 is a one-sided view of the issue and it should not form part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is all about trying to make proper arrangements and dispositions with regard to the relationship between local education authorities and school governing boards. It is not to do with the activities or expenditures of the Department for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

If the hon. Member for Wallsend had had more time to think about the matter before Father Christmas delivered some goodies to him in the recess, he might have tabled an amendment to deal with the points that he has spent most of his time making. Instead, we are now debating clause 28 stand part. The clause relates to the Government's view that it is right to ensure that schools that wish to pursue grant maintained status—as a result either of their governors' decision or of an initiation of the procedure by parents—have the resources to do so properly and on an even basis, as far as one can provide for that, as against the enormous power of local education authorities, of which we are all aware and have recently become even more aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essence of clause 28. In effect, it says that it is not unreasonable to allow help and support to be given, when appropriate, to schools' governing bodies and, equally, it is not unreasonable to provide for limitations to be placed on the extent to which local education authorities can use their enormous resources in participating in the debate and in the balloting procedure. That, quite simply, is what clause 28 is all about. It is not, was not intended to be, and cannot be, about the matters raised by the hon. Member for Wallsend, who meandered through a variety of other factors. I believe that when any investigations that he may initiate have taken place they will reveal nothing of very great moment because nothing that my Department does is hidden. We have nothing to apologise for. We are confident that the bodies to which the hon. Gentleman referred are acting perfectly properly and I believe that he will be disappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that, in its annual return to Companies house, the Grant Maintained Schools Centre has chosen not to make a full disclosure of how it spends its money? It has used a provision of companies legislation that allows it not to show how the £760,000 of public money is spent. That can hardly be open and above board government. Bearing in mind what he has just said, will the Minister give a commitment to the Committee that he will ensure that the Grant Maintained Schools Centre will make a full disclosure of how it spends more than £750,000 of public money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that the full panoply of investigation available to the House and to other bodies, as brought to bear on any body that receives public money, will satisfactorily answer those questions. Given the length of time that the body has existed and operated, and given the ability of all Members of Parliament to initiate the kind of actions suggested by the hon. Gentleman, we can let those matters take their course and we shall see the outcome. I am not particularly anxious or nervous about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the Minister has said about the rights of an hon. Member, like my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend, to initiate further inquiries into what may well be financial irregularities or an unhealthy covering up of how public money is spent. Will the Minister admit to being unhappy about that? Will he undertake to speak to Sir Robert Balchin to get a full account of how the money is spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for you, Mr. Martin, to decide what the Committee should debate. I thought that we were debating clause 28. I undertake to draw Sir Robert Balchin's

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>771</span>
attention to hon. Members' comments. I am sure that he will want to ensure that these questions are dealt with fully and properly, if, indeed, they need be. Sir Robert, in common with any other citizen, and especially because of his responsibilities, will be unhappy about those serious allegations. He will wish to take every possible opportunity to investigate them, which is the right way to proceed. Any inquiries or investigations that were instigated by the hon. Member for Wallsend will, if necessary, run their course. Let us leave these matters to one side for now because they have no bearing on the clause, which, I repeat, is a transparent measure whose objectives must be clear. We considered that the clause was most appropriate for the Bill at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given our experience over some years, and after an increasing number of ballots in schools, we have been anxious to ensure a level playing field to provide schools with reasonable resources with which to do their job properly, and to place some limitation on the involvement of LEAs. Clause 28 is an integral part of the Bill and at one with its objectives. I believe that it should, and will, receive the Committee's whole-hearted support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the recess, we expressed our concern about the powers being vested in the Secretary of State for Education. Again, clause 28 vests some extraordinary powers in the holder of that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out other concern regarding the creating of the funding agency for schools was that it would be staffed by Conservative party sympathisers. This was echoed last week by Professor Bolton at the north of England education conference. The information given to us this evening about the running of the organisations Choice in Education and the Grant Maintained Schools Centre shows that these fears were well founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unconvinced by the Minister's statement that clause 28 attempts to bring about a level playing field for grant-maintained schools. In my view, it is designed to achieve the reverse. The first part of the clause empowers the Secretary of State for Education to make funds available to school governing bodies for the purposes of opt-out ballots and campaigns. They are given almost carte blanche to spend. The Secretary of State will guarantee any expenditure that they consider necessary because he is so committed to the idea of the opt-out concept in education and the creation of grant-maintained status under the Government's direct control. When parents are called upon to consider whether a school should have grant-maintained status, they should bear in mind that they will be opting out of a local network that is probably well organised and into a central network under this incompetent Tory Government. The Government are trying to overcome that problem by the inclusion of clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latter part of the clause proposes to limit the money that LEAs may spend. On the one hand, the Secretary of State will have power to say how much school governing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>772</span>
bodies can spend on campaigns and opting out, but will limit the amount that LEAs may spend. Far from creating a level playing field, the Government are creating a system that is biased towards school governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the amount that LEAs are allowed to spend on these campaigns is set at the start of the financial year. If the LEA has a flurry of applications, it may find, halfway through the year, that the Secretary of State has set the amount so low that no funds are available to provide information to people in the area about the choices they are being asked to make. That is wrong and anti-democratic, as I hope that the Minister will concede.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a bad Bill and a bad clause. It is the Government's prejudice made into statute; it will allow the Secretary of State almost complete control over the funds to be made available for the ballot to opt out. They will be allocated in favour of the governing bodies and against the LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide for a prescribed amount to be available to both sides in the campaign and thus would resolve the problems that I outlined. It is an intellectually spurious argument that economies of scale on behalf of the LEAs may allow them to spend more than school governing bodies. What nonsense! When a school applies for grant-maintained status, the LEA wants to be involved in that ballot and in the democratic process to keep the parents involved fully informed of the choices available. It is not a matter of economies of scale: funds will be specifically directed to the school that has applied to ballot for grant-maintained status. The Minister's argument is not worthy of him. This clause shows just how bad the Bill can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
