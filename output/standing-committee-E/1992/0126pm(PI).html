	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 377, in page 84, line 22, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'and shall prepare an annual report which shall be sent to the Secretary of State on the availability of special education in their area.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is crucial to the clause, which clause repeats the provisions of the Education Act 1981. It instructs local education authorities to
	<br><blockquote><p>"keep under review the arrangements made by them for special educational provision."</p></blockquote>
Given the extra thought that the Government appear to have given to part III, some of the concessions that they have already announced and some of the amendments that they have tabled, we thought that they might have reconsidered clause 142. We believe—as do the Special Education Consortium and all the organisations across the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
spectrum of special educational needs and activities that belong to it—that restricting the review of the arrangements made by the LEA leaves provision that may be made in grant-maintained schools in limbo. It could be argued that such provision will be covered by the duties laid upon governors of grant-maintained schools to ensure that the special educational needs of children attending those schools are catered for. But we believe that a gap appears between the provision made in grant-maintained schools and that made by the LEAs, under their responsibilities for special educational needs, as set out in the 1981 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a child has a statement, it might be argued that the problem does not arise. The child will have been assessed and statemented. A grant-maintained school may have been named in the statement and it would have to accept the child. In that sense, we are fairly sure and would hope that, given good will on all sides, the process will work. However, we believe that there is the potential for confusion. Given that far fewer schools are likely to opt out at primary level than at secondary level, it is also possible that although needs may be met at primary level such provision may not survive easily at the secondary level. Therefore, amendment No. 422 requires the LEA not simply to review its provison but to plan it and, in so doing, to consult every body, including grant-maintained schools, that has an interest in ensuring that in any local authority area proper provision will be made for all children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Department for Education has not produced a more expansive amendment. Circular 7/91 provides a good framework for a
	<br><blockquote><p>"clear and coherent authority-wide policy".</p></blockquote>
Without the involvement of grant-maintained schools in planning and provision, the local authority's policy will be fatally flawed. The Government have admitted that local authorities should have a major role, and that more than one authority should co-operate in the provision of special education, especially if it is highly specialised. The Government hope that when the grant for education support and training is no longer available, local authorities will make their own arrangements. Some local authorities are already considering that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that the Government accept amendment No. 422 at least in principle so that there is proper overall provision. Deaf Accord has given the example of a shire county which recently identified the need for an upper school to provide total communication in order to take children currently educated in a total communication primary school. If all the upper schools were grant maintained and none of them could provide total communication techniques and support, it is likely that they would be unable to take those children unless the local authority approached them and obtained prior agreement. If provisions for such planning were enshrined in the Bill, including consultation with grant-maintained schools, it would ensure that even if all secondary schools were grant maintained, special provision at primary level would also be available at secondary level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deaf Accord and other organisations involved with special educational needs are worried that there could be a breakdown in provision between primary and secondary level. The amendment recommends that the reviews to be carried out should be co-ordinated along the lines of section 19 of the Children Act 1989. The Special Education Consortium and its members—I mention Deaf Accord in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1083</span>
particular because it has raised the point—are worried about the high incidence of abuse of deaf children. The National Deaf Children's Society has a project entitled "Keep Deaf Children Safe". That organisation believes that the amendment's provision for a review would ensure that representations from, for example, the local authority social services department and the health authority, were taken into account. The amendment refers to health authorities, but trusts now exist in many areas. The amendment should, therefore, state, "health authority or trust". I am sure that the Government will accept the principle of the amendment and improve it. Deaf Accord and the National Deaf Children's Society support the collaborative review arrangements set out in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Special Education Consortium fears that unless something more than a LEA review of its own arrangements is established, gaps in the provision for special educational needs will appear as more schools become grant maintained. The amendment seeks to overcome the problems and to set up a planning process, which was suggested by the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts in 1987 when it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our experience is that it is important for an LEA to have a clear statement of its policy on integration, developed in consultation with parents and professionals, as part of its overall policy on special education. Parental choice is a necessary qualifier of, but not a substitute for, sensible strategic planning by an LEA."</p></blockquote>
We should allow a reasonable time to discuss all the important issues that we must tackle today. I hope that the Minister will either explain how the Bill already covers the points that I have raised or accept an amendment to clause 142 to provide for comprehensive provision, planning and a review, which would incorporate grant-maintained schools and other organisations, such as local authority social services departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, especially its emphais on the need for the effectiveness of current procedures for the identification and assessment of children with special educational needs to be kept under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some experience of children with special needs. As a parent of a child who suffered from dyslexia, I know something of the sense of failure and loss of confidence that such children experience. I have also observed how teachers can misunderstand a child's condition, and the totally inappropriate, even hostile, treatment that children sometimes suffer when their specific needs are not recognised. Their educational progress can also be damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a teacher of English for many years, I could recognise dyslexia in children when there was no consensus that it existed and the idea that it was a specific condition was pooh-poohed. It is important to recognise that condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many other members of the Committee, I have been approached by constituents who have spoken of the difficulties they encountered when trying to meet the needs of their children. The amount of time taken to determine whether children have special educational needs and the provision that must be made for them must be kept under
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
constant review. That process cannot be left to chance and LEAs must check constantly whether their procedures enable them to operate efficiently and quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultation paper, "Special Educational Needs—Access to the System", states that the Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"proposes … to legislate to ensure that the procedures for making assessments and statements are made within specific timescales".</p></blockquote>
That is their intention and I understand that the code of practice that they will publish will cover that provision. However, we have heard nothing about its content and there will be no debate when the regulations are published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents can experience terrible frustration at the long delay in the process. As months slip by perceptive psychological and educational damage is caused to pupils. We have heard nothing to suggest that the process from referral to the making of a statement will not remain a long, drawn-out affair. It is important to bear in mind that the rationale for that process is the protection of children, because we are concerned about their protection and right to appropriate provision when that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh Office and Department for Education guidelines recommend that the time from referral to the preparation of the draft statement should be six months. However, I am told that the median for England and Wales is about 12 months. One LEA has been cited as requiring as long as three years for the process to be completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also bear in mind that at the time of referral, when the process is initiated, the child is already experiencing difficulties. That is why the referral takes place, it usually happens only after parents have made several visits to a school to raise the issue. In most cases, the process is initiated by the parents. A constituent of mine described how the process took two years and three months. It started when the child was nine and a half-years-old, when the parents initiated the process after the child had suffered a crisis. It was 12 months before the child saw a psychologist, I understand that it is not unusual for six months to pass before that occurs. The child was nearly 12-years-old before the first draft was provided and then it was unsatisfactory. There was a long wait for a psychologist, another for a medical report and further delay before a statement was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that a great deal can be done, even within existing resources, to tighten the procedure to ensure that everything is better co-ordinated. It is essential that we should recognise that as a priority, even within the available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the present resources are inadequate but that is not a sufficient reason or excuse for the delays that often occur. The establishment of tribunals will expedite the appeals procedures but I emphasise that, when the code of conduct is published, it must set down strict guidelines for the time taken for the process to be completed. It is essential for LEAs constantly to review their procedures, as the amendment advocates. It is for local authorities to establish the right practice, then it is up to society—all of us—to ensure that the resources are provided. Society must take that decision. In its scale of values, the needs of those pupils must receive higher priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is intended to clarify the powers that LEAs would retain to co-ordinate special educational needs policy. What powers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1085</span>
will they have to assist governors to ensure that the special needs of pupils are identified and met, in accordance with clause 144?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education Act 1981 increased the powers of LEAs over special needs policy, in recognition of the fact that, without such powers, the needs of the more vulnerable students might be overlooked when schools were faced with other competing pressures. Since then the competing pressures have increased, while the powers of coordination of LEAs have been drastically reduced. The amendment would clarify the LEAs' role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said this morning that special education policy should aim to prevent difficulties arising in mainstream schools, and to provide support for schools and students when difficulties arise. However, if resources are to be devolved almost entirely to individual schools, the possibility of the flexible development of policy will virtually disappear. The problem becomes particularly clear when we consider special schools. In the past, some special schools have become a key feature of local authority policy, where staff in special schools have supported colleagues in the mainstream to develop teaching strategies and curricula that have prevented the need for a special school place or even for a statement of special educational needs. In that way they have been linked flexibly to other support services provided by LEAs and there has been clear scope for their role in education to evolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of special schools in the plans for grant-maintained status hinders their evolution and encourages regression to an earlier isolated state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the interface between LEAs and grant-maintained schools in the provision for special educational needs, and I am confused by the letter from the Minister which is undated but begins with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing to let you know of two amendments to the Education Bill which I propose to table in relation to pupils with special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
When the Minister describes the policy statements that schools should provide, he says in part (iv) that they should
	<br><blockquote><p>"set out the use the school makes of central support services".</p></blockquote>
That seems to imply that schools have the option to opt out of LEA services, and that the budget for special educational needs is devolved to schools, rather than being kept at the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether that applies to students with statements or to students with special needs with health statements. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disturbed by the amendment because it reads like a prescription for another bureaucratic nightmare. Although I agree that education authorities should keep their arrangements for special education under review, to prescribe who should be consulted when conducting such a review, as the amendment does, leads me to believe that it would take at least three years to elicit one response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation process is virtually the same as that described in the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Although we may believe that the way in which the children are treated is right, none of us believes that the process is speedy or flexible. I want a provision for children with special educational needs that allows a flexible response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
Apart from the bureaucratic nightmare, there is also a presumption against special schools. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) will probably tell me that there is not, but that is what seems to have been built into proposed subsection (1)(b). The ned for special schools is proven and many children benefit from being taken out of mainstream schooling, attending a special school for a year or two and becoming equipped with the skills to return to the mainstream. They do not necessarily need to be segregated all their education life. I would hate any presumption against the use of special schools to be incorported into legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph (b) has a qualification, "where practicable". Even another, stronger amendment about integration allows that there will have to be separate education for children with special needs at certain times because their needs are so special. There is not a presumption against special schools, merely an effort to ensure that more children are integrated where it is practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are pretty close to violent agreement, but the amendment presumes against using special schools as a total educational package or as a way of children moving within the education system. It is made worse by the resistance to special schools becoming grant maintained. I welcome with pleasure the Government amendments which will allow special schools to become grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will allow special schools in the grant-maintained and non-maintained sectors to sell their services to an education authority and to parents more flexibly. There is a school in my constituency for delicate children which, following the restructuring of the Inner London education authority, is responsible to Lambeth. Its roll should be 36 pupils. It currently has 19, so it can be understood why Lambeth says that that school is far too expensive. The cost is divided by 19 instead of 36. Just yesterday, the school was visited by the parents of a potential pupil. A social worker went with them and afterwards commented, "I did not know that this school existed." I shall make no comment about the shame that is Lambeth at the moment, but that is typical of the problems that maintained and non-maintained special schools have in getting across to LEAs and parents their message about the valuable contribution that those schools can make to ensure a better education for children who need special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined some of the reasons why I resist the amendment. It is prescriptive and presumes against special schools and, as drafted, the clause would allow special schools in the maintained and non-maintained sector to sell their services more effectively than they do at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment touches on a vital part of the provision for special educational needs. At the outset, I should remind the Committee of the philosophical and practical basis for the concept of grant-maintained schools, lest we have forgotten that because it seems so long since we debated it. Grant-maintained schools are given the option, after parental ballot, of leaving the control of their local education authority to become more autonomous and independent. In doing that, they are charged with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1087</span>
continuing to make proper provision for children with special educational needs. That is an important and continuing responsibility for grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such schools will come increasingly under the aegis of the funding agency for schools. Therefore, depending on the stage reached in a particular area—we considered stages 1, 2 and 3 earlier—it is logical and correct for the funding agency, the local authority or both, when appropriate, to have responsibility for planning the provision of places for children with special educational needs and for providing the necessary funding to support those places. If we start from that position—I would characterise it as the mainstream provision—the provision of places for children with special educational needs will be under the two different regimes that we discussed earlier: local education authorities and the funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the points made by the hon. Member for Bridgend. If you will allow me, Mr. Martin, I shall leap to consideration of clause 144 and our proposed amendment to it. We shall create a powerful new tool in the requirement on all schools, during the annual reporting process, to report on the implementation of their governing bodies' policies for pupils with special educational needs. Schools will be required to identify clearly and to detail the provisions that they are making for special educational needs pupils. That is an important element in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already considered clause 137, which is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provision of information by governing body".</p></blockquote>
It should be recalled that subsection (4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body shall make such reports and returns, and give such information, to any local education authority by whom any functions are exercisable—
	<ol>
	<li>in relation to the school, or</li>
	<li>in relation to registered pupils at the school,".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Self-evidently and importantly, that will include the special educational needs provisions to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A picture is emerging that I believe goes all the way towards meeting the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bridgend. We have detailed provisions for schools to report on their provision for special educational needs. The overall and overriding requirement is on the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools, in particular, to give such reports and returns as are necessary to the local education authority. That covers the provision of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-ordination element comes in two different forms. First, the funding agency for schools will identify needs and make provision for them through the funding mechanism. Secondly, under, I think, clauses 5 and 14, LEAs and the funding agency for schools will, in turn, have to provide each other with information and to act co-operatively in some circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I describe, the situation that I used to support the amendment? Let us consider the most difficult case, where children are receiving total communications support but do not have statements because the local education authority has agreed provision with the parents without need of a statement. Nothing says that a child must have a statement if an LEA automatically provides the support that a child needs to the satisfaction of its parents. If such provision is made in a primary school

and the nearest secondary school is grant maintained, will the LEA have the power to tell that grant-maintained school, "We have these four children who need total communication; you must take on that responsibility"? Will the school be able to turn down the LEA, so that the LEA has to ask other schools in its area to provide for those children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to take advice on that sequence of events. It may help if I tell the hon. Gentleman that I shall arrange that grant-maintained schools will be enabled and encouraged to apply for capital grants for structural alterations to the school and the provision of the equipment that he mentioned. Bidding for such capital grants will not prejudice bids for capital expenditure for other purposes. I became aware some time ago of the possibility of a gap in provision. It is important for us to make such provision possible under the funding agency for schools, so that grant-maintained schools can provide what the hon. Gentleman—if I have understood him correctly—wants. We want to ensure that, where the bulk, or all, of schools are grant maintained, there is no shortage of the provision that the hon. Gentleman described. The dilemma need not arise. I am tackling the issue from a different angle, but where such a problem arose, it would be covered in that way. I expect that will answer the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the issue in the round and consider the role that I have identified for the schools themselves with the reporting mechanism. Importantly, Ofsted, the new independent inspectorate, will be expected to examine and report on the adherence of schools to their published policy on special educational needs. That will be yet another mechanism that will establish the viability and practicability of schools' delivery of special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely want the answer to this question: the Minister says that Ofsted will be required to consider the adherence to special educational needs policies; is that included in the current trial framework?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be absolutely sure about what the Minister said about provision for the move from primary to secondary schools where all or most schools are grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Minister say that, if a local education authority establishes a specific need for special provision in the secondary sector that is not available at the time that the need arises, a grant-maintained school will automatically receive the grant or loan to enable provision to be made merely by establishing a need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me to say something that I have been around long enough to resist, as he will understand I must. It is unrealistic to suggest that an application for funds will automatically be granted. However, I can say that if there is a clearly-established need of the sort the hon. Gentleman describes, given the mechanism that I outlined—which is what it would largely be designed to meet—I cannot imagine there being any difficulty. That is as far as I am prepared to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his other question about non-statemented pupils in grant-maintained schools of the type that he described, parents would have the right to apply to the school in the usual way. The school would operate its usual admission
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
arrangements and would not be able to turn down a child because it had a special educational need, and the appeals mechanism would work in the usual way. He can be assured that the specific category and example that he quoted can, and will, be met by either the usual admission arrangements and appeals process, or by the other method that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To echo the theme of my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait), who analysed the amendment most skilfully, I am sure that the provisions in the Bill can more than amply meet the anxieties outlined by the hon. Member for Bridgend without the rather bureaucratic overlay that the amendment would impose. For these practical reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the Minister's remarks encouraged me. However, there are still important principles in our amendment that may be met by bringing together different parts of the Bill. Perhaps in the end, the Government will adopt a coherent policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye spoke about the social worker who was unaware of the school in Lambeth that implemented the provision. If our amendment were operative, the social worker would have known about that school because of the consultation processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to turn this into a dialogue. The hon. Gentleman misses the point. Where there is a presumption against special schools, as in Lambeth, there is no reason why the social worker should know unless the school itself is allowed to sell its services. [HON. MEMBERS: "Sell?"] I mean in the technical, not the financial, sense. If hon. Members do not understand the language yet, I am inclined to wonder what we have been doing for the past 12 years. [HON. MEMBERS: "Don't we all!"] Schools need an opportunity to ensure that social workers who may have to care for a child know of the existence of the schools in the maintained and non-maintained sector and the services that they provide. This would not necessarily come about through the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ on that. The consultation process proposed in our amendment would ensure that all relevant authorities would be aware of the special schools and other schools that provided services for children with special educational needs.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be prepared, reluctantly, to seek leave to withdraw the amendment, provided that the Minister was prepared to make a definitive statement before Report on the exact method of integration, which he began to allude to in his reply. That was not sufficient, but perhaps there is a kernel of a system whereby different parts of the Bill can be brought together to cover the points raised by the amendments. As the Minister is not prepared to give such confirmation, I shall have to ask the Committee duly to consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments provide an opportunity to continue the debate that we had when we considered the previous amendments, which were concerned with the coordination of special educational needs provision. I think it is already acknowledged by every member of the Committee that there is a difficulty in co-ordinating that provision by the various sectors involved: health and education—in maintained, non-maintained and independent schools—and social services. We all recognise that the Bill and the Government new clauses and amendments bring into play two further groups that will have considerable involvement in special educational needs provision. They are grant-maintained schools and the proposed grant-maintained special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that increased complexity, it is vital that there should be some co-ordination and that someone will be responsible for reviewing and reporting upon all provision in a particular area. That information should be collected nationally and would be of enormous benefit. It would ensure an effective matching of need with available provision. All hon. Members will know of the innumerable cases in which out-of-county provision is made by LEAs or in which children with special educational needs are supported, at LEA expense, in non-maintained or independent schools. A clear picture of such provision is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Coopers and Lybrand report entitled "Within Reach" has already been mentioned in our proceedings. Paragraph 503 of that report referred to the relative lack of information about a number of aspects of special educational needs provision. In paragraph 505 of that report, Coopers and Lybrand encouraged the Government to support research into resolving the uncertainties and into supplying the missing information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the report recommends that the Government undertake that research, but do not the Spastics Society and the National Union of Teachers intend to commission Coopers and Lybrand to examine the problem further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is unfair for hon. Members to hold a conversation when a speech is being made. If hon. Members wish to converse they should leave the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. The intervention by the hon. Member for Bridgend is important as it shows that many people will continue to be involved in the gathering of information about special educational needs provision. The Coopers and Lybrand report makes it clear that the current collection methods leave significant gaps and recommends that the Government act to ensure that those gaps are filled. An important argument for the amendment is that making an LEA responsible for reviewing provision in its area will go some way towards filling those gaps. The LEA has the greatest involvement in, and responsibility for, the educational provision in a local area and so must be placed to review it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as it is drafted will mean that the LEA will be required to review only the special educational needs provision for which it is responsible in its area. That is peculiar. Surely all hon. Members accept that, for many reasons, an LEA must know what is happening in the grant-maintained schools and the grant-maintained special schools in its area. If an LEA is to be involved in the statementing of children and their allocation to a school, as the Bill requires, it must know what provision is available in schools for which it does not have direct responsibility—in non-maintained and independent schools, and also in grant-maintained schools and grant-maintained special schools. If changes in access or staffing provision, or in other special facilities, occur in a school, it is vital that the LEA is informed. If the Government are right, and the grant-maintained schools will develop in their own way, they will develop forms of good practice for special educational needs provision. That good practice must be shared with the LEA schools, so that all schools and all children can benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the LEA will be responsible for the statementing of all children, including children who are in a grant-maintained school. Therefore, there must be close links between the LEA and the grant-maintained school because before a child is statemented, the decision to do so must be made. It is vital that the LEA knows all about provision and needs of individual children in grant-maintained schools. For a number of reasons, the LEA has a legitimate reason for knowing the special educational need provision. Therefore, the LEA should have the greatest responsibility for reviewing not only its own, but all provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the phrase, "by them." The Government have already accepted the responsibilities of the LEA, such as provision of special educational needs over that for which they are directly providing. They have already allowed special education needs support services to trade beyond the margins of their capacity and to be offered equally to LEA and GM schools. They have already proposed that educational psychologists and welfare officers should be mandatory exceptions to the LEAs' potential schools' budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new local management of schools consultation document, the Government are already considering allowing other support services—which they term the low-incident services—such as hearing impaired and visually impaired, to be outside the delegation. The Government's acceptance of the LEAs' involvement is already there. The Bill and the Minister's amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
make it clear that the LEA will be responsible for statementing and related matters for all pupils, in all schools in their areas, even including beyond the 75 per cent. trigger point, at which point the funding authorities would be responsible for all other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the LEA in special needs provision outside its own provision is clear. Therefore, it is obvious that the LEA is in the best position to carry out the necessary review. The Minister may say that his amendment—amendment No. 718 to clause 144—provides the solution to the problem. I do not believe that it does for many important reasons. Under the amendment a report must be prepared in voluntary, maintained special or grant-maintained schools to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"information as may be prescribed about the implementation of the governing body's policy for pupils with special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
It is unclear from the amendment whether the report will even be published. The Minister's initial letter, which made it clear that he intended to table an amendment, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am therefore proposing to seek an amendment to the Education Bill which would put a statutory duty on each school to draw up, publish and report on its policy towards all of its pupils who have special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
Despite that, amendment No. 718 does not include provision to report. The end of the amendment refers to paragraph 8(2) of schedule 6, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The articles must require the governing body to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the registered parents of all registered pupils at the school and all persons employed at the school are given (free of charge) a copy of the report."</p></blockquote>
That is jolly good—those directly involved in the school will get a copy. The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) copies of the report are available for inspection (at all reasonable times and free of charge) at the school."</p></blockquote>
That is hardly publishing the report, making it available to a wider audience and, most importantly, going to some trouble to ensure that the local education authority receives a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision also does not go as far as necessary to ensure that there is a proper review. Nothing in the amendment would require anyone to compile an overview of all the reports produced by all the schools. Who will get the complete picture of what is happening in a particular area and from that build up a national picture to ensure that need is matched properly with provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that if that does not satisfy me, the code of practice may. I am sure that the code of practice will be excellent and will cover a wide range of issues that must be included in the report and many practices that the Minister expects to take place in schools. However, a code of practice is a non-statutory document. It is vital that such important matters be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt that the Minister's response will satisfy me or that, within the Bill as it stands and the amendments that have been moved so far, there will be a mechanism to ensure that all the data regarding the work in a particular area will be brought together and reviewed adequately so that we can match properly need with provision. My amendment would enable that to happen and specifies who would be responsible for doing it—the body that has the greatest involvement with special educational needs provision in its particular area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief question for the Minister on how the provision will be brought into effect and on the review carried out by the local education authorities. He said earlier that the code of practice would provide some help. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that as the code of practice is non-statutory, it does not have the same legal standing as a provision in the Bill. If a parent cited the code of practice when making an appeal to a tribunal, would that be sufficient for the tribunal to reach a decision, based on whether the local authority had complied with the code of practice in its provision for the child?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Esteile Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall raise a few more issues, to which I hope that the Minister will reply. The case for the amendment has been made exceptionally well and is unanswerable. We have made progress in recognising the need for overall co-ordination of special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have argued more strongly than Conservative Members for greater overall co-ordination of all educational provisions by the LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome, however, the agreement that has been reached between us in that there is a need for as little fragmentation as possible in the provision of special educational needs. As a result, we can examine the range of provisions and offer parents real choice when they are deciding what sort of education is most suitable for their children. A natural progression of what the Government have been saying over the past few weeks is to give to the local education authority responsibility for monitoring the provision for special educational needs throughout the geographical area that it controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look beyond statementing. Progress has also been made in Committee in recognising that not only children with statements have a special need. As people who wish to cater for everyone's needs, we are beginning to acknowledge those children without a statement, but who have the need for extra special provision above and beyond that which is traditionally provided in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of the research on access undertaken by the Spastics Society in conjunction with the NUT. That has shown the consequences of not having an effective overall review of what provision is available within a certain geographical area. The Spastics Society and the NUT, through Coopers and Lybrand, found that there was now no cost audit of access to schools. When they asked the LEAs how much money it would cost them to provide access for children with physical disabilities, so that a reasoned judgment could be made whether it would be financially preferable to do that than to cater for such children in special schools, no such information was available. Neither the Government nor the LEAs that were surveyed knew what the schools were like and what work should be done to enable children with physical disabilities to gain access to the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the Government's job is to enable those whom they charge with providing education to make effective decisions. They cannot expect LEAs to make effective decisions about the provision of facilities for children with special educational needs unless they ensure that LEAs have the information against which effective decisions can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said about the need for the Bill to be more specific than it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
is about the code of guidance. Circulars 11/90 and 7/91 explain how LEAs should review a special educational needs provision. It is interesting that the circulars differ from one another. Both give good guidance to LEAs, but they do not issue an overall code of guidance about what information is necessary by which LEAs can make effective decisions about special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that much attention has been focused on the needs of children with special educational needs, through our consultation with representative organisations, we now have the chance in the Bill to say once and for all what an LEA should know about such needs in its area, so that it can match provision to needs. We have not done that, because overall agreement has not been reached on the nature of the information that an LEA should hold. We can now integrate special needs children into schools and work out the difference in cost between providing increased access to non-special schools and to special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To enable more effective decisions to be taken by LEAs, it is crucial that we do more than simply say, "Thou shalt be a code of guidance as the Secretary of State or future Secretaries of State see fit." We should also state in the Bill the nature of the information that should be collected. The consequence of not having such information has been shown clearly in the report. Without it, LEAs cannot make effective decisions about whether children with a physical disability are better educated in special or non-special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has two main thrusts. As the Committee has acknowledged the special role of LEAs in providing and monitoring provision for pupils with special educational needs, it makes sense to give them the responsibility for monitoring all needs within the area and not only those for which they have a direct responsibility. It also makes sense that at this important time of reviewing legislation that will continue for many decades, we now state in the Bill what information we expect local authorities to find out and to hold so that we can be sure that they will be able to make good decisions against a sound background and with sound facts. That will enable us to meet the need that the Government have stated again and again that they want to meet—the right of parents to make decisions about where their children are educated. Unless there is that information and a clear statement that certain provisions meet certain needs, parents will not be able to make effective decisions about the future of their child's education. I hope that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath finds favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly puzzled by the arguments that the hon. Member for Bath used when moving the amendment. He laid great stress on the provision of national figures and analyses, yet the amendment concentrates on the activities of local education authorities. That is a slight inconsistency which he is about to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When you, Mr. Martin, chided the Minister for having a conversation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was not the Minister, I apologise immediately and withdraw that accusation. At that time I made the point that there needs to be a stage at which local information is brought together nationally and disseminated to ensure that it is recognised when that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
out-of-county provision is made. That fact would not necessarily be picked up. The Minister is right to raise the point but I have already covered it. That addition still needs to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. I shall go through the arguments stage by stage and build up a picture for Committee members to persuade them that the amendment is unnecessary. The first building block of the argument is the requirement—which I shall propose to the Committee when we debate clause 144—for every school to publish in its annual report details of its special educational needs policy. If the Committee wishes, I shall go through a long list of what I envisage being included. I shall not go through the whole list, but I envisage it including the number of pupils with special educational needs, including those with statements, and an indication of the level of support for those pupils; admission arrangements and policy and the particular special educational needs that the school caters for, such as dyslexia or physical handicap; any available special units, building adaptations that the school has made, or facilities additional to those ordinarily available such as withdrawal rooms, loop systems for HI or adapted computers; specialist accommodation resources, the extent of physical access for pupils with special needs, the school's objectives for pupils with special educational needs and the timescales over which those objectives should be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on at length but I shall not. I wanted to give the Committee a flavour of the detail that we envisage being built into this important addition to the reporting mechanism. However, I shall answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bath about whether the material would be published. The annual reports are required of governors of LEA schools under section 30 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 and of grant-maintained schools under paragraph 8 of schedule 6 to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will use his powers under section 8(5) of the Education Act 1980 and clause 137(1) of the Bill to require school governors to publish the information. There, stated as simply as I can, is the commitment to our intention that the information should be in the public domain. Indeed, that always was our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can add to the provision to which I referred a moment ago, because clause 137(4) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body shall make such reports and returns, and give such information, to any local education authority by whom any functions are exercisable—
	<ol>
	<li>in relation to the school, or</li>
	<li>in relation to registered pupils at the school".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another power allowing LEAs to gather the information at school level and publish it at local authority level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to recall clause 14, which is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty to compile information and conduct research about provision of education".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each funding authority shall—
	<ol>
	<li>compile such information, and</li>
	<li>make such provision for conducting, or assisting the conduct of, research,</li></ol>
as may be required for the purpose of providing the Secretary of State and local education authorities, in such form and at such times as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1096</span>
My final reference relates to clause 5, which we debated several months ago—it seems like years. Clause 5(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each funding authority—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) shall provide the Secretary of State with such information or advice in connection with any function of his relating to the provision of education as he may from time to time require".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
The Bill makes ample provision for the gathering and dissemination of information at school level, at local authority level, funding agency level, and between those authorities. That information is finally gathered at the pinnacle, the Secretary of State. That mechanism is more than adequate to provide for what Opposition Members have asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has kindly given much detail. First, in respect of publication, the Minister told us that the powers to be used by the Secretary of State are existing ones that require that information be published. That requirement, however, is not a provision of the Bill. Will the Minister explain why he objects to an amendment that makes clear that that information is to be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to the LEA compiling data, carrying out research and so on. I remember our earlier debate on that and my understanding is that compilation of data and the carrying out of research relates to the LEA's own provisions. Will the Minister confirm that that requirement will cover provisions in respect of special educational need made by bodies other than LEA schools? That is the key issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will. I am satisfied that the comprehensive provisions made in the earlier parts of the Bill will cover what the hon. Gentleman asks for. He sees an unnecessary difficulty. As I said before, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with details of why I believe that that should be the case. No problem is intended, or needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several references have been made to the code of practice, but, regrettably, this morning we did not have time to deal with it as thoroughly as some might have wished. It is important to our consideration of this part of the Bill. The new code of practice will be designed to help all those involved in special educational needs provision to build on the conditions of the 1981 Act. It will address three main problems. It will seek to ensure greater consistency in the making of statements—a point raised so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Mr. Faber) this morning. It will relate to greater timeliness, which concerns everyone. We may consider that issue again later. It will also relate to greater precision in the contents of statements. The new special educational needs tribunal will take account of the code when it considers appeals. The code will play a crucial role in the tribunal's work and in the criteria on which the tribunal will base its decisions. The code will be central to the improvements that members of the Committee support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have commissioned two respected experts to work as consultants. One will work on the criteria that LEAs will use to assess a child and issue a statement. The other will consider the procedures that LEAs will adopt, the time scales to which they will work and the form and content of the statements. That is the broad division of labour, although the two experts will work closely together. We have also created an informal advisory group, which consists of experts in special needs from local authorities, a senior member of Ofsted and some senior and equally respected officials from my Department. They will work on the code, its contents and how it should be developed.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1097</span>
We wished to include people of standing, expertise and impartiality from outside the Department to work on it. It is vital to get it right. The code is central to what we wish to achieve. I reassure all hon. Members who spoke about the amendment that the code will play a central role and will be statutory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear what the Minister says about the code of practice. The fatal flaw in clause 142 was its repetition of a provision in the 1981 Act. After 10 years, that Act has not proved satisfactory. It is important that the code of practice receives the back-up that the Minister describes, and that local authorities have a clear framework in which to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman shares the view of the code that I am trying to develop. Clause 140 refers to the code, which is, therefore, statutory. Regrettably, we had no time to linger over that clause. We have partly remedied that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Bath and other hon. Members are answered by the Bill; provisions that I shall try to introduce when we consider clause 144, and other arrangements that support them—details of schools' special educational needs policies, which are required to be included in annual reports, and the details of the code of practice. I cannot guess the details of the latter. The people to whom I have referred have to carry out a lot of work on it. I hope that I have reassured the Committee sufficiently for members to feel safe in rejecting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is tempting to quibble with some of the Minister's statements, especially his last comments about the code of practice. Clause 140 refers to a code of practice that applies to LEAs and their duties, but does not cover grant-maintained schools. Perhaps the Minister will tackle that point in his amendment to clause 144.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more than willing to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Minister will write to me and explain why it is not necessary and that annual reports will be published and will be given to the LEAs, which will be required to review special educational needs provision, including that not provided directly by them. If those three points are covered by the legislation and by the Minister's comments, my amendment is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that if the matter is covered already why does not the Minister accept the amendments and let us get on with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been a member of the Committee as long as I have so he must know that if a provision is already covered we do not include it again. That is not the right way to make statute. I have been at pains to point out to the Committee that if I think that a matter has already been dealt with satisfactorily, it should not be necessary to deal with it again. It is not desirable to include such provisions in a potential Act of Parliament, which is set in stone and cannot be altered except by further legislation. That important consideration should be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for intervening: I thought that he would have made that point earlier. In that case, why has clause 142 been included? Nevertheless, we have received the assurances that I seek, and I look forward to receiving a letter from the Minister.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would regulate the practice of integrating into mainstream schools children and young people with learning difficulties or disabilities. It should be possible for parents who have found an integrated placement for a child in one area to find a similar placement in another area. The amendment would ensure that good practice in one LEA is spread to other LEAs and from one school to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to fulfil the intention of the 1981 Act by tightening the wording. As drafted, the Bill would retain an unsatisfactory feature of that Act. We are not suggesting that all children should be educated in mainstream schools, but we want the onus to be on the school or the LEA to make provision available in a mainstream school if possible. That was the intention of the 1981 Act but it has not been interpreted in that way by some LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the 1981 Act was passed it seemed reasonable to expect that its integration clause would enable LEAs to explore actively the possibility of including more children and young people with a learning difficulty or disability in mainstream schools. Sure enough some did—some LEAs have good practice—but others interpreted the let-out clauses to mean that they did not have to change. They argued that if they were not currently providing support in the mainstream for the children's special educational needs, a mainstream place would be incompatible as such children would be receiving the special educational provision that they required. If the Act is interpreted in that way, the integration clause has no force. There is no point producing a law that makes no difference to practice. It is inconceivable that that could have been Parliament's intention in framing that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there has been a slight national decrease in the proportion of children attending special schools since the implementation of the 1981 Act—1·34 per cent. of the 1990 school population—the variation between LEAs is considerable. Using the 1990 figures, Cornwall excluded only 0·6 per cent. of its population into special schools while Lambeth—about which we have heard much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1099</span>
recently—excluded more than six times as many, almost 4 per cent. For those children's parents, placement in the mainstream or a special school depends on where they live. It also depends to a large extent on who they are, how vociferous and articulate they are and how well they state their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of clause 143 requires that three conditions should be met if a child with special educational needs is to be educated in a mainstream school, that is
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a school which is not a special school".</p></blockquote>
The three conditions are
	<br><blockquote><p>"that educating the child in a school which is not a special school is compatible with—
	<ol>
	<li>his receiving the special educational provision which his learning difficulty calls for,</li>
	<li>the provision of efficient education for the children with whom he will be educated, and</li>
	<li>the efficient use of resources."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Let us consider a situation which has been repeated many times in England and Wales in the almost 10 years since the 1981 Act came into force. The parents of a child with special needs who is going through the statementing process ask that their child should be able to attend a mainstream school. They are told that in their authority, special education provision for a child such as theirs is only available in a special school. They say that they have visited a school in a neighbouring authority where provision is made in the mainstream. They know that this provision was made in the mainstream by transferring resources from one budget heading to another, without involving additional expenditure. The parents say that the additional resource transferred into the mainstream school—perhaps time from a specialist teacher or support from a learning support assistant—far from interfering with the efficient education of others becomes a resource from which many other children benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's intention to encourage integration into mainstream schools. Once they have experienced it, many people realise the advantages, but often LEA officers refuse to engage parents in the arguments that I have outlined. They refer to the 1981 Act and say that the law does not require them to change. As things are, special provision is made only in a special school. I do not believe that that is what the clause or the Bill intend after 10 years of arguments in favour of respecting parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good practice in and just outside my constituency. There is a unit for children with physical and mental disabilities at Impington village college. It successfully integrates children into ordinary classroom teaching. The experiences of Grove primary school and the Manor community college, which are in Cambridge, have shown how children with visual disabilities can become part of the mainstream to the benefit of the whole school. I have been sent information by the Centre for Studies on Integration in Education, which described a similar case in Wolverhampton where Castlecroft and Smestow schools provide for children with visual impairments. The centre described the case of Francine White and her husband, who are almost totally blind, and their two girls, who are partially sighted. The experience of the parents in special and residential schools when they were young made them all the more determined that the girls should attend ordinary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm the example that my hon. Friend has described. The PenyBont special school in Bridgend now has virtually no visually impaired children
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
attending it. It is probable that in the not-too-distant future the provision for such children will be made in a totally integrated fashion throughout Mid Glamorgan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing my attention to another school in which good practice exists. The Opposition wish to ensure that that good practice is encouraged and spreads to other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was discussing the example sent to me by the Centre for Studies on Integration in Education. The parents of the two girls feel that the behavioural and social effects of attending ordinary school are as important as the educational ones. At a recent hospital check-up of the two daughters, the mother was asked by a play leader why her children were so different from others with visual impairments. The case studies published by the centre reports that the play leader had noticed
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a lot of partially sighted and blind people are full of mannerisms"</p></blockquote>
but that the daughters of Mrs. White were not. The mother added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They look directly at people, walk well, cross the road confidently, ride their bikes up and down the street and go skating and swimming.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>They have lots of sighted friends, and I like the way they treat the girls, not singling them out and talking to them differently. That's exactly right and how it should be."</p></blockquote>
That is a powerful case for integration. The examples of good, efficient mainstream practice for a wide variety of students with special needs are available in some LEAs and others can learn from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am optimistic that the Minister will accept the amendment as he has listened to the strength of the argument. It would encourage the careful documentation and the spread of good practice. I reiterate that the Opposition are arguing not for the sudden closure of special schools, but for raising the standard of decision-making about children and for giving to parents of children with special needs the same say in education as we would like to see for all other parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment involves a slight rephrasing of the clause. It would not take much ink to do that. It would give a clear signal to LEAs and tribunals considering parental appeals that, in producing a statement for parents who wish their child with special needs to attend a mainstream school, an effort has to be made to make that choice compatible with the sensible and efficient deployment of resources. The amendment would change the Bill only slightly, but it would make a vast difference to some parents who have seen their choices thwarted and their arguments ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), but I am not convinced that it is necessary to go beyond the existing wording of the clause in the way that she suggests. I have two reasons for saying that. First, I must tell her bluntly that I do not go as far as she does in wishing to push as many children as possible into mainstream provision. There is a proper place for special school education and placement, and a proper mechanism in the Bill to allow that to be identified, with appropriate parental input. I am uneasy about attempts to try to put ever more children with statements into mainstream education provision just for the sake of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many people believe passionately that it is right in almost all circumstances to educate under mainstream provision a child or young person who has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
statemented special need. Others believe that there may always be a proper role for special schools. We need not be too doctrinaire; it is possible that the existing balance is not bad. I certainly contend that the Bill is not an unreasonable reflection of the admitted division of view and feeling. The provisions in the clause are about right. In that case, and remembering the hon. Lady's example of parents who want a child with a statement educated in a mainstream school while the LEA, for whatever reason, is adamant that it must go to a special school, the rights of appeal that we are building in, and the provision for an independent tribunal, discussion of which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education will guide through the Committee, will provide the answer to the problem as she explained it and as I understood it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, the balance is a difficult one to strike. I suggest that it is unnecessary and undesirable to push the argument so far in one direction, given that we must respect the different views and emphasis often put by parents, professionals and others. I respect the hon. Lady's view. I ask her to join me and through the mechanisms in the Bill, which will encourage the continuation of a balance in education provision, respect as far as possible the views of parents and those involved in the statementing process. This will also ensure as far as possible that everyone involved has the maximum and best available choice. I am nervous about the amendment and ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. He shows a misunderstanding of how the system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the example that I gave of the parents of two partially-sighted children attending schools in Wolverhampton, the parents had to move to the area to get that provision. They decided that they wanted that type of integrated education for their children but were not able to find it in their former local education authority. That option is not open to every parent because sometimes it is impossible for parents to move to another area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear that we were not talking about pushing children into mainstream provision, but where children have experienced that provision, their parents become convinced that it is the best way to educate them. Often there is no turning back; a parent does not want a child to be segregated in a special school, and would prefer to find similar provision in a mainstream school. We are not talking about the matter for its own sake, as the Minister said. There is a proper role for special schools and the onus should be on local education authorities and schools to make provision available, wherever possible, in mainstream schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather difficult at times for local education authorities to transfer resources and they may need a little encouragement to do so. One difficulty is that if large numbers of children are being educated in special schools, removing some of them to a mainstream school can be an expensive process. It is not until a large number of children are moved and perhaps part or whole of a school can be closed, that the efficient transfer of resources takes place. Local education authorities realise that and find it difficult to make that initial move, so our amendment is designed to encourage them to make it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider, throw away some of the caution that he expressed earlier and decide to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have brought a case to the Minister's attention, so he knows that I appreciate that there is a difficult balance between mainstream education and special education. In that case, I was arguing against a local authority for special education, which must be provided regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make a presumption that we are trying to get pupils back into mainstream education—that is what this slight amendment would accomplish. It would strike the right balance, whereas there is a temptation with special schools, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said this morning, to enlarge the numbers of pupils to get more grants. That is a wholly praiseworthy objective, and we should not damn it but, inevitably, there is a temptation to keep pupils in them for as long as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause poses a dilemma. It uses the word "efficient" but I suspect that if those who drafted it had thought more carefully they would have employed the word "effective" because it is the effectiveness of what one does that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a plea about consultation of the children who are to be educated. They do not always make the best decisions for themselves but it is essential to take their views into account. Often, that can tip over into either a special school or the mainstream of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can be brief, Mr. Martin, but still emphasise that the issue at stake is important. All too often, despite the fine framework that exists in many areas to meet the needs of children in our schools, funding difficulties, or even an interpretation of words such as "efficient" in legislation, can result in decisions that are against the spirit of the 1981 Act and that could, therefore, be against the spirit of the Bill once it is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
One example of what all too frequently happens concerns a five-year-old wheelchair user, living in East Anglia. He has been refused entry to a local mainstream primary school attended by the elder child of the family. The reason given was that the local authority could not afford the necessary adaptations to the school, which, it was argued, would be an inefficient use of the school's resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that to replace the word "efficient" with the word "effective" is in some ways a marginal improvement, but we believe that it opens out a little the arguments about money, allowing effective, as opposed to efficient, provision. For example, we hope that it will allow consideration of the wider case for community use of such a school by other wheelchair users. It could be argued that, while the interests of the local education authority sometimes might not be the same as those of another local authority in the area, there could be a slightly different case to answer after the introduction of unitary authorities, which is likely in many parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government will be prepared to accept the amendment, which is based on our belief in the importance of providing resources to ensure that the good intentions of the Bill are carried out, whereas the good intentions of the 1981 Act were carried out only in part, with wide variations around the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said about the amendment. In our proceedings we have heard a great deal about the efficacy of the provisions of the Education Act 1981 for special educational needs. One of that Act's underlying principles was that there should be a presumption in favour of integration and that special schools that are not integrated should be the exceptions to the rule. Every pupil should have the opportunity, by right and entitlement, to go to ordinary schools. I accept that there will always be a need for special schools and for a small amount of segregation, but we should try as far as possible to keep such segregation to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also integral to the 1981 Act that individual special needs should be identified, with the result that categorisation would be removed. The principle was that there should be a needs-led assessment. However, all too often the implementation of the 1981 Act has resulted in resource-led assessment. The Government did not accept the previous amendment, and as a result the clause uses the status quo as a barrier to integration. It means that a school that cannot cope with a pupil's needs need only say, "We can't do it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 708 would remove that barrier by stipulating that resources should be used effectively rather than efficiently. That would provide some way to say to schools that they could use their resources to ensure that integration takes place. For that reason, I hope that the Government accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting amendment. It could initiate a debate that ranges more widely, although I sense that that is not the desire of the Committee, nor of you, Mr. Martin. However, the amendment presents a dilemma. The proposed change of words is either wishful thinking—not a good addition to a Bill—or an expression of hope that the insertion into a Bill of a word such as "effective" will, as if by magic, allow more resources to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
produced and used in a way that is desirable to the hon. Member for Bridgend. That is not the way things work, as Opposition Members will acknowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth, as in all parts of Government, is that the allocation of resources is largely a political decision, driven by practicality and the Government's assessment of requirements. It will not do to pretend that the insertion of a word such as "effective" into the Bill will automatically release more resources for purposes that are perceived to be desirable. It would not, and it would be less than honest of me to say otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that the use of the word "efficient"—in this Bill, as in many others—is appropriate and proper. Whether decisions about priorities or the allocation and deployment of resources across competing demands are made in schools, LEAs, in the planned funding agency or in Government Departments, there will always be difficult, conflicting demands that can be resolved only by setting priorities and bringing to bear the criterion of efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To extend the logic of the Minister's argument, if it is more expensive to educate pupils with special needs in ordinary schools, those schools will not have them because that is not an efficient or effective use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there are other considerations. The efficiency criterion is one among others; it is not the sole criterion and exists to provide a sense of balance. Turning the argument around, if there were no regard to efficiency, all people would have what they wanted, when they wanted it and where they wanted it. People would have exactly the education—or health—provision that they wanted on their doorstep, as they specified it, without let or hindrance. At one extreme lies the sole criterion of efficiency, and at the other lies the wishful criterion of people having what they want by simply passing a law to specify that. Somewhere in-between lies reality. We are trying to establish here what that reality is and how it works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister putting the emphasis on cost rather than on value? That is really the difference between efficient and effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Value is an interesting concept to introduce into the debate because value for money is what efficiency is about. Those concepts go well together and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the important concept of value. That intervention, for which I am grateful, illustrates the difficulty of the debate. Those words are important. The Opposition would not have wanted to include in the Bill the word "effective" if they did not think that it was important, although the hon. Member for Bridgend said that he thought that the change might be marginal. I suspect that he hopes that it would be more than that. Replacing the word "efficient" with the word "effective" would result in a change that was considerably more than marginal. If it were only marginal, there would not be much between us. However, I regard the change of words as more significant than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reject the amendment, despite the charming and persuasive argument of Opposition Members, because what lies beneath it is much more difficult to handle. It is much harder to envisage how it would work than Opposition Members suggest. The amendment is an ingenious effort to unlock resources that may or may not

exist—the availability of resources is subject to a hierarchy of decisions that involves an overall Government decision, local education authority decisions and decisions within schools to prioritise and to set provision against resources and establish value for money. For all those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would help to open up the debate on the use and value of resources. There are many examples in which the needs of children with special educational needs have not been met because of how the wording of existing legislation has been interpreted. However, we shall have an opportunity later to discuss the important issue of resources. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 84, line 35, at end add—

	<p>No. 348, in clause 147, page 86, line 6, after 'identify', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consultation with parents, and when possible, children."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we wish to discuss other matters before the guillotine falls at 7 pm and because I expect Conservative Members to agree with the principle behind amendment No. 173. I hope that the Minister and Conservative Members have read the amendment carefully. I am sure that if they have, they will think that the objective behind it is reasonable. The other amendments use language similar to that of amendment No. 173 and say that the views of the child must be taken into account where possible or practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the amendments is clear—the principle should be established that the wishes of the child should be taken into account wherever possible. We are not saying that that is possible in all circumstances and in the case of every child; nor are we saying that the child will have the last word or a veto, or determine his education. The amendments are realistic and constructive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard—as we always hear in education debates—a great deal about taking the wishes of parents into account and the need to respect the judgment of professionals. We must respect those principles and endeavour to incorporate them into the legislation. It is important that we introduce in the Bill a mechanism for ensuring that the wishes of the child are incorporated and considered wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that the principle should be established, not least because the Government have ratified the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, which states that the views of children should be taken into account, wherever possible, and not least because the principle embodied in the amendments is one that the Government have taken on board in other legislation such as the Children Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is significant support from people with experience of special educational needs work for such a provision. The Spastics Society's report, "A Hard Act to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
Follow" acknowledges that there are occasions on which the wishes of the child are not fully considered and that that should happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many occasions on which the child's views are important. An example is a child who has difficulty hearing and has a choice between a signing school or a sound-assisted school. What a child is comfortable with is important, so I accept the principle behind the amendments. However, I wonder if the amendment should have stated the age at which a child's views should be taken into account. The nearer a child gets to the sixth form and further education stage, the more important such a provision becomes. However, in the earlier stages of primary education, such a provision is not as realistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I ask Conservative Members to read carefully the wording of the amendments. Amendment No. 348 states that the child's view must be regarded "when possible". That wording reflects the hon. Gentleman's concern. I hope that he will agree that the principle should be established that where it is possible and realistic for a child to express constructive views about his or her education, that should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A child may have to move schools to gain from a different kind of provision. The marginal advantage of that move might be outweighed by the disruption that the child would feel given that he or she may have to travel further and so on. The desire to be with friends and to be in circumstances that work for the child must be taken into account. That should not be the be-all and end-all; it is not the only issue that must be considered. There should, however, be scope for at least considering the wishes of the child when it is appropriate and possible for the child to make them known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) said, it is important that a child feels comfortable with his or her education and has confidence in the teaching and support staff in the school. Older children are capable of expressing their wishes in that regard. Most parents would be able to say what their children wanted, but there are times when parents might be too pushy and ambitious in terms of what their children feel comfortable with or when parents might be too restrictive and protective, especially of children with special needs. If the Minister cannot accept the wording of the amendment, I hope that he will accept that its principle should be enshrined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has already mentioned that the Children Act 1989 gives important powers to children. Children's wishes should be taken into consideration under the clause. If the Government accept the principle of children having the right to express their opinions, they might consider clause 148, for example, which covers the notice to a parent of the intention to make an assessment. Notice should be taken of a child's views on that, certainly those of a child who is of reasonable age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth bearing in mind that, at times, parents might oppose the making of a statement. When a decision whether the child needs to be statemented is marginal, a child's views could influence the LEA's decision. A child's understanding of his or her needs might often be greater than the parents' understanding. That should also be taken into account when considering the right of appeal under clauses 150 and 151.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unknown for parents' pride to be hurt by what they regard as a deficiency in their child's learning ability.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
At times, parents might refuse to recognise that. I have had experience of parents feeling a sense of shame at their children having to be placed in a special class or a special school. However, it is not unknown for children in certain circumstances to be happier in such settings. Their wishes should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I should have preferred the earlier amendment to be accepted, I consider that the clause is about right. It would be strengthened by the amendment but, given that there is a presumption in favour of integration in mainstream schools, the clause recognises exceptions when the parents' wish is taken into account. The child's wish should be recognised, too. It is important that a child can understand the likelihood of his or her being happier and being able to make better educational progress in circumstances that have been set up specifically for that purpose. A child should have the right to express his or her opinions about being placed in a special class or a special school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a child who has special educational needs that cannot be met in a mainstream school. The child refuses to attend the mainstream school and the parents refuse to allow him or her to attend a special school. The child stays away from school and is not educated for about two years. It could be that the child wishes to attend the special needs and have his or her needs met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) mentioned the way in which the rights of parents might operate in respect of the rights of the child. Rather than discusss the matter in the clause stand part debate, I thought that we could consider the rights of the child here. Parents are given the right to be consulted under schedule 9; they have the right to name a maintained or grant-maintained school—and if other amendments are accepted, a non-maintained or independent special school—and they have the right to appeal to an independent tribunal. Yet clause 143 gives the right of veto over where a child is educated unless that is incompatible with the parents' wishes. The Special Education Consortium has obtained two legal opinions that say that the effect of the clause would be to give the parents a right of veto. Would the Minister comment on those opinions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. member for Dewsbury proposed the amendment and the report's comments about the matter. The question is whether we can provide for the child's views to be taken into account in the Bill without providing endless possibilities for litigation. That is the balance that we must consider. If a child is out of sorts with its parents—the case to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) referred—there are other methods by which someone can stand in on that child's behalf and protect his or her interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statementing starts at the school when the school and the parents have together identified a need in the child that needs to be addressed. One would hope that the child is a party to the discussion at that stage and is consulted by parents and teachers so that one can decide what the problem is and how it can best be resolved. The child's wishes ought to be taken into account, and probably are in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
most cases. It is important that the child be comfortable and can fit into the kind of education chosen. If a child's rights vis-a-vis the parents, the school, the education authority and the health authority were to be too tightly framed in law, all the experts would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy with the spirit of the hon. Lady's message; I am not convinced that it can helpfully be included in the Bill. We should always address the child's needs. I have seen too many children who are unhappy with their special needs education. For example, I know one family with a boy with Down's syndrome very well. He is desperately unhappy because he is in a special school in which little reading goes on. He enjoys books and would be much happier at another type of school—even a mainstream school that had the necessary support to give him the best possible education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why it is reasonable to make the child paramount in principle in the Children Act 1989 but not in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am feeling my way in the debate, as is the hon. Member for Dewsbury, to discover whether there is a way of extending that sort of right into education without harming the child. We must ensure that whatever the Bill provides—the issue, as I said, could allow litigation—does not prevent a decision being taken that is in the best interest of the child, even if the child does not think so at the time. I am trying to avoid that, and at the same time to ensure, with the hon. Lady, that the child's views, interests and feelings are taken into account. I hope that that will happen during the process. Perhaps we can ensure that by circular from the Department to those who will carry out the process. I am not making a definitive statement. In principle I support the hon. Lady, but I question whether her proposal will lead to complications in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the joys of the many hours that we have spent together in Committee has been to listen to the extraordinary god sense of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea whenever he rises to speak. I hope that I shall enjoy that pleasure on further occasions before we finish our deliberations. He encapsulated my feelings about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why I have reservations about the amendment. The first reason is detailed. It is important but I shall not dwell on it. The wording of the amendment goes considerably further than the equivalent wording in the Children Act 1989, as it omits the key expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"considered in the light of his age and understanding"</p></blockquote>
which is in the Act. That is an important change; I do not know whether it was intentional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question has just arisen why, if such a provision was good enough for the Children Act 1989, it is not good enough for the Education Bill—a fair question. The answer is that the Act ranges much more widely on welfare issues, inter-personal relations and the child's existence in a social environment, whereas the Bill—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> To answer the hon. Member for Bridgend, the Bill deals with more strictly educational matters. It is at least arguable that there is a difference between taking full account of a young person's attitudes and responses in a social and welfare context, and asking the child to make a judgment, utter an opinion or give a view on his or her educational requirements. I would not push the distinction too far, but the Committee would do well to bear it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>
I return to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. In circular 22/89, which we issued together with the Department of Health, we stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The feelings and perceptions of the child concerned should be taken into account, and older children and young persons should be able to share in discussions on their needs and any proposed provision."</p></blockquote>
That strikes me as a sensible, balanced view. It is not overly prescriptive. It is guidance that can be updated from time to time. However, we are prepared to go further than that. In my famous and increasingly acclaimed code of practice, we shall issue full guidance on the duties included in this part of the Bill. That is where we shall deal with the issues of taking account of the views and wishes of the child, after careful deliberation on the code of practice, and after consultation, which is my Department's habitual practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult matter. The hon. Member for Dewsbury has set out her stall, but on balance I prefer the version of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, who was a little more cautious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend asked an important question. I shall read a response to him. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand it, I shall not blame him, but it might help if I had sight of the opinion that he mentioned—if he shows me his, I will show him mine. I should like to look at the opinion and to give a considered response. Let me have a go at an answer. It will at least be on record, and all concerned can ponder it, but I hope that no one questions me on it when I have finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 143 puts a specific duty on the LEA to specify an ordinary school as opposed to a special school, subject to certain conditions set out in subsection (2). That duty applies unless that is incompatible with the parent's wishes. If it is incompatible with the parent's wishes, then that duty on the LEA does not apply. In that case, clause 143 falls away. It does not follow that the LEA has a duty to specify a special school placement. Instead, the LEA should consider the appropriate school for the child, using its powers and duties under schedule 9. If the parent expresses a preference for a maintained special school, paragraph 3(3) of schedule 9 requires the LEA to name that school, subject to conditions, including its suitability to the child's special educational need. I hope that the Committee follows me so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the special school chosen by the parent is unsuitable to the child's special educational needs, the authority is obliged to override the parent's choice and may name an ordinary school. The parent of course has the right to appeal to the tribunal over the authority's decision under paragraph 4 of schedule 9. If a parent does not express a perference for a particular school, special or ordinary, paragraph 6 of schedule 9 requires the authority to make a statement, either in the form originally proposed or in a form modified in the light of any representations made by the parent. If the parent has made representations to the effect that he does not wish an ordinary school placement for his child, the LEA must of course take those representations into consideration, but has no duty to be bound by those wishes, clause 143 being irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, of course I cannot agree. I have submitted to the Committee my considered response to an opinion of learned counsel that I have not yet seen. Hon. Members should not be surprised that my answer was somewhat opaque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now respond seriously to the hon. Gentleman. If he would be kind enough to let me have sight of the opinion that he referred to, I undertake to look at it urgently and carefully. I shall then come back, either to the Committee or directly to the hon. Member for Bridgend, to see whether there is a difficulty that should be resolved and, if so, how it might be resolved. The hon. Gentleman might take the opportunity to study the words that I have read into the record, to see whether they meet his objections. Between us, I hope that we shall sort it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the amendment. For the reasons that I have given, the reasons given to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, and having heard my assurance, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what assurance the Minister gave us. As my hon. Friend said after the Minister read his detailed response, the Minister has a way with words. That may have been true of the letter, but I share the sentiments of the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) that plain English has a part to play. I hope to see more of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment has not been disputed. I was not sure whether the Minister was annoyed because he had not thought of it himself, in which case he could have agreed and accepted it in principle. I suspect that the fact that that is an Opposition amendment might have prevented him from doing so. Perhaps one solution would be for us to table an amendment on Report that included the words mentioned by the Minister, that the feelings and perceptions of the child should be taken into account. If the Minister can live with that wording, we might be able to incorporate them in an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the Minister said that the guidance will be set out only in a code of practice. I am not satisfied that there will be sufficient consultation. I hope that we can return to the subject later, and I bear in mind what the Minister said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
