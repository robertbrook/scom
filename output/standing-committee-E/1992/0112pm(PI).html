<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 271, in page 10, line 28, after 'parent', insert 'or employee'.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that you, Mr. Martin, will agree that this morning I was able to make strenuous argument for the amendment. On the strength of that, I hope that it will gain the Committee's support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment represents a considerable departure from what we have become accustomed to. No doubt that was the intention of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). However, because it takes the Committee into such new territory, hon. Members would be well advised to pause and consider it carefully. The whole thrust of the Government's legislation—as it exists up to now, as it is presented in this Bill and as it is envisaged in the future—is that parents are the key to the crucial, school-by-school decisions about whether grant-maintained status should be sought.<br><br>
The amendment would broaden the mechanism and would therefore affect that principle. Superficially, it appears attractive, but we must consider the merits of taking the direction that it opens up. Is the amendment necessary? Would it add anything to the process? More importantly, would it detract from the process? The hon. Gentleman, whose remarks, perhaps inevitably, were somewhat brief, given that we were approaching the break for lunch, did not make as comprehensive a case as he might otherwise have done. That is a pity, as it is important that the Committee understands all the ramifications of the amendment. The list of parents' names and addresses has been, and sometimes still is, the subject of contention. The proposal to broaden that list and make it available to school employees represents a considerable departure. What is the purpose of that proposal? Conservative Members will want to stand firm on the principle that the electorate who will make these vital
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
decisions will remain the registered parents at the school. To make their details available to others—even to people who are as closely involved in the school as its employees—would be a departure that I am reluctant to allow.<br><br>
The proposal to involve the head teacher belongs in a slightly different category and could complicate the matter and muddy the waters. I do not see the necessity for it. The existing procedures have worked satisfactorily. To introduce the new dimensions suggested by the amendment would open up the process beyond what has been envisaged in the Bill and the Government's policies up to now, and could complicate the matter unnecessarily. I accept the hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks at face value. He said that he was not in the business of complicating matters.<br><br>
We rest our case on parental involvement and responsibility. However attractive some of the ideas behind the amendments may be, the Committee should reject them for the reasons that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat surprised by the Minister's statement that the amendment takes us into new territory and that it could introduce new dimensions and complications. That is his main reason for opposing it. The Bill contains 255 clauses and 17 schedules. It is an enormous measure that is enormously complicated. It takes us into many new territories. I wish that the Minister would follow his own advice and not take such a measure any further. Sadly, he will not do that.<br><br>
There is clear opposition to the amendment, and the Committee needs to make progress. We may gain the support of the Government on other issues. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My feelings about the clause may not be shared by the Committee. However, they are views that professionals and parents, in and outside my constituency, have expressed to me. I mentioned my reservations about the clause on Second Reading.<br><br>
When the Minister responded to the previous amendment, he spoke about making lists of parents more widely available. The amendment would have been ineffective. If one parent can obtain on demand a list of the names of other parents and, by implication, the names of children, that information becomes public. To whom the list is available beyond other parents is, therefore, academic. The clause gives unfettered access to the names and addresses of parents of children in a school, or schools, in a particular area. Perhaps that is an unintended side effect. However, I appreciate that information must be made available for ballots to take place on opting out. I am, therefore, not opposed to making such information available. I shall, however, present several reservations, and I hope that the Minister will respond to them.<br><br>
I have reservations about who might obtain the information and to what use they might put lists of parents' names and addresses. The spectrum of my anxieties ranges from nuisance to danger. The lists could be acquired by commercial organisations which could use them for commercial purposes. Parents whose names are on the list could receive unsolicited letters from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0510">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
commercial interests. I would classify that as a nuisance, and of course unsolicited letters can always be dispatched to the waste paper bin.<br><br>
My second concern is that almost every week, for reasons that must be obvious to everyone in the Committee, schools turn down a request from one parent for the name and address of another parent. There are occasions when one child falls out with another in school and the parent of one comes to school demanding to know where the other child lives. Usually, after 24 hours, tempers have calmed, the parent withdraws and there is no longer a necessity to contact the other parent. Good sense prevails if there is time to calm down. I am worried that, if lists are freely and publically available—which they will be, as soon as parents can go in and demand them—parents in such circumstances could look at the list, find out where another parent lived and conduct whatever business they wished to on that person's doorstep.<br><br>
In the local newspaper for my area, the <i>Western Evening Herald,</i> there was recently a report of a case in which a parent had an altercation with another parent, which ended in a charge of grievous bodily harm being brought by one against the other. It had all started with a children's squabble in the playground.<br><br>
There are more serious matters involved. One of the gravest difficulties experienced by schools arises from the estrangement of one parent, usually the father, who breaks with the family for one reason or another. The breakdown of relationships is often associated with violence. In some cases it is associated with drink or drugs. Sometimes in those circumstances a parent, usually the mother, seeks refuge at another address and does not wish the estranged parent to have access to the child or to the address where they are living.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which I should have thought was the reason for the inclusion of subsection (3) in the Bill, giving parents the right to have their names excluded from the list. That is to protect people in exactly such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) for bringing that matter up. I shall answer his point when I have mentioned the last of my concerns.<br><br>
A father or a mother could be estranged from a child for many years and then seek access, which would not be in the interests of the child or of the parent looking after that child. Not only do schools regularly turn down requests for such information, but they give specific instructions, to teachers in charge of registers and information about children, that such information must not be released. I have seen many school registers from which a child's address has been removed for that reason—so that no child or other person could look over the teacher's shoulder and find out that child's address. I am concerned that such information would now be easily accessible in a list that was made public.<br><br>
My fourth concern is that the lists could be collected and amassed by people with the most unnatural interest in children. I have heard the measure described as a paedophile's charter. It is a way of identifying the address of every single child in a locality. That concerns me deeply. I speak as one who has been professionally involved with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
children for 25 years, and who has three children of his own. I would not wish my own children's details to appear openly on registers available to people who could have an unnatural interest in children. The information would be available because any parent could demand and obtain it, and freely pass it on to any other party.<br><br>
I shall now deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Battersea. Circumstances in families change from day to day and from week to week. If there were a serious crisis in a family, such as a violent father being ejected from the family, the last thing on the mother's mind would be to remove her name from the electoral register for opting-out ballots at her child's school. I cannot picture that being her first priority in a moment of crisis and need.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Keeping the register up to date and in line with parents' wishes, especially in the circumstances that I described, presents schools with considerable difficulties in ensuring that, hour by hour and day by day, the information is accurate and reflects parents' needs. That is a difficult task. In a large school, such as the community college in which I worked and which had almost 1,300 children, the list could be changed every day. It would place an enormous burden on the school to expect it to reprint the list every day that a parent asked for his or her name to be removed. In those circumstances, the possibility of error would be great.<br><br>
I appreciate the inclusion of subsection (3) and I hope that it will be publicised to those parents whose children may be at risk or who do not want their name to be known publicly by appearing on the list. However, subsection (3) is not a complete safeguard, especially to the most vulnerable.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister has given the matter some thought and I would be grateful if he would share some of those thoughts with us. What reassurances can he give us that the lists will be used properly and not fall into the hands of others, such as those whom I have mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) has raised important and sensitive issues. As the clause is a re-enactment of the statute, that will give some reassurance, if only for the reason that we have a few years' experience of the way in which such mechanisms operate and on which we can form a judgment. If we were acting ab initio and debating the matter in 1987 or 1988, the hon. Gentleman's remarks would greatly concern me and all members of the Committee and give us pause for thought. However, the fact that the clause is a re-enactment and we have that experience is helpful. I am not aware of—I was going to say "any", but I shall be more careful and add the word "significant"—any significant number of complaints of the kind that the hon. Gentleman has described. I do not know whether he has any examples or whether his remarks are an understandable fear of the possibility of the information becoming available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier in the debate the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) referred to the fact that as we and governors become more familiar with the Bill, people will become aware that they will be able to obtain the lists. I am sure that many parents did not realise that the lists could be obtained or that they were in the public domain. I am perturbed by the fact that, as more schools opt out, the information will become more publicly known
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0511">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
and people will realise that they can ask for the lists. At the moment, many parents do not realise that they can request the lists or that their names are on them and in the public domain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has clarified usefully the issues that we are considering. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman does not have any examples, but he is rightly speculating that, with more ballots taking place and with greater knowledge of the mechanisms, the possibility exists of wider dissemination of information. I accept his point.<br><br>
At the outset of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman said that when one parent receives the information it is as good as public. I do not think that that is fair or right. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that some parents will be prepared to sell the list to commercial interests, if they are approached, or that they will make the list available to people with evil intent. It would be unlikely that people who, by definition, are parents of school-age children, would do that.<br><br>
We must draw from experience. In all the cases that we have had so far, that suggestion cannot be demonstrated, so a carry-forward provision from a previous statute into this Bill is on relatively sound ground. However, my responsibilities in the Department for Education extend to most of the sensitive aspects of the Department's work, including employees or people involved in education who have had to be debarred from employment for various reasons, for example the abuse of children. It is a matter to which I am particularly sensitive. If there is evidence of the hon. Gentleman's examples in the way in which the Bill will operate or in the existing operation of the grant-maintained ballots, causing either a nuisance or real danger, I would be prepared to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As added reassurance, perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister should underline that the list is of parents, not children. There is no identification of the sex, age or name of the child or whether a particular child has any special needs and therefore might be vulnerable. It is simply a list of parents. I hope that that gives reassurance that there would be an obstacle to the unpleasant and unacceptable problems of the paedophile register to which the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his relevant comment. Schools, by their nature, will always be vulnerable to the evil and wicked people that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Plymouth, Devonport mentioned. Very distressing cases occur from time to time, with people waiting outside school premises and following children, and so on. There will always be such vulnerability of which we must be aware and deal with.<br><br>
Partly because of the reasons that I have given, and particularly because of my hon. Friend's point, I do not think that the availability of the lists and the nature of their information will lend themselves to the additional vulnerability to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The balance of probability is that they will not do so, and experience shows that they have not. I accept that we must be aware of the problems. If there is evidence of such things happening, we should study them with great urgency to satisfy ourselves of the causes and what could be done. I am more than happy to give that undertaking.<br><br>
There is the problem of the estranged partner who might be violent. Such people would probably find other ways of finding out information that they need. I doubt
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
whether this method would add significantly to their capacity to do that. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's comments. However, when the Bill becomes law, what influence will the Minister have if my fears prove to have been fully grounded and serious difficulties arise? What powers would the Minister then have to alter the accessibility of the lists?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State would be subject to and bound by the statute as it was at the time, as, indeed, he has been for almost five years. Again, I pray in aid experience. That this has effectively been a statute for a number of years is a fact; our experience is also a fact.<br><br>
I should like to take the hon. Gentleman's question away and consider it carefully. I shall not give the hon. Gentleman a snap answer, because I wish to take advice from my officials and from lawyers in the Department on how it might be possible, within the scope of the Bill—or the statute, as it now is—to deal with those matters. I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman as soon as possible to see whether I can give him further comfort after I have made inquiries in the Department about the matters that he has raised. I hope that he will accept that undertaking. I try to resist the temptation—although I succumb occasionally—to give a slick or snap answer to something as important as that.<br><br>
Frankly, as we are on clause stand part, there is, procedurally, nothing that the hon. Gentleman or I could do if we wanted to change the Bill now. But I shall look at the provisions again to see what answer I can give him. The hon. Gentleman or someone else might feel moved to take the matter further if that is judged appropriate, but I do not think that such action would be right at this stage. I hope that the Committee does not believe the hon. Gentleman's concerns to be of sufficient strength to justify rejecting the clause in its entirety, as it deals with an important part of the procedures that we have developed for the movement of schools towards grant-maintained status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend's reassurance will help the hon. Gentleman, as it helps all members of the Committee. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to cast his mind back to the little exchange on subsection (3).<br><br>
In circumstances in which parents had split up, I would expect the head teacher to be aware of the problem and, if the mother was at risk from the father, or afraid of violence, to draw her attention to her right to be deleted from the list if she feared that her former partner would threaten her. Perhaps that could be drawn to the attention of head teachers when appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We might want to look at the guidance given to governors and the literature available to parents to see whether it is possible to strengthen the approach and provide the reassurance and protection to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.<br><br>
I hope that my remarks, combined with those of my hon. Friend, will reassure the hon. Gentleman, and that the Committee will let clause 19 stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister will deliberate with his officials and lawyers, he might find that he has concerns about the operation of the clause which he can do nothing about because the Bill has been enacted. Given that possibility, will the Minister consider, at a later stage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
in the Bill's passage, bringing forward an amendment that would allow the Secretary of State to withdraw or alter the provision should problems be reported to him in years to come?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I smile, Mr. Martin, although I do not want to be flippant, because it is unusual indeed for the hon. Gentleman to ask me to consider giving the Secretary of State a further power. In the context of this issue I undertake to consider the substance of what the hon. Gentleman said and the strength of his anxieties in the light of our knowledge and experience. I want to discuss the issue further with colleagues in the Department and to consider whether safeguards might be desirable in the Bill. If that is so, I shall not hesitate to return at a later stage with an appropriate amendment. I suspect that what the hon. Gentleman suggests would command widespread support in the House. I do not envisage any difficulty about it. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman as soon as possible with any further information that I have on the matter.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
BALLOT OF PARENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 353, in page 11, line 21, leave out subsection (6) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Before distributing any information to parents relating the case for seeking grant-maintained status for the school, the governing body shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that such information is balanced, objective and accurate.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would delete subsection (6) and replace it with alternative wording, which would mean that balanced, objective and accurate information would be provided by the governing body of a school to parents who take part in the important ballot. There has been much discussion in Committee of information provided by local education authorities that attempts to influence the decision of schools considering grant-maintained status. There have been many accusations of intimidation by LEAs and of their providing inaccurate and unbalanced information. I do not want to re-open that debate; I merely point out that Conservative Members are anxious to ensure that information provided about grant-maintained status, wherever it comes from, is as balanced, objective and accurate as possible. Debate about alleged intimidation has usually involved criticism of Labour-controlled LEAs, but there are opposite examples. I came across a newspaper article recently in which Sir Robert Balchin, chairman of the Grant-Maintained Schools Foundation—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Conservative Members cheer his work; I hope that they will also cheer the statements that he made, which were reported in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 4 November 1992. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The intimidation … is more overt in Labour authorities but just as dangerous and more subtle in some Conservative ones."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Evennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erith and Crayford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the Liberal Democrats?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Robert Balchin made no comment about Liberal Democrat-controlled LEAs in the article or, in

fairness, I would have referred to it. It is important that a range of balanced, objective and accurate information is available, as Conservative Members agree.<br><br>
There has been little mention of information being released by the governing bodies of schools seeking grant-maintained status. Sadly, there is evidence that information supplied is not balanced, objective or accurate. There are many examples of misleading information being provided. For example, figures are quoted that assume that the maximum grant will be obtained or that capital grant will be granted for new buildings, or that there will be significantly increased funds. There are other similar assumptions.<br><br>
I shall give a couple of examples that illustrate my point. The governing body of a Sheffield school circulated nine different documents promoting grant-maintained status. In one document it mentioned its arguments and the LEA's response, but that response had not been written by the LEA. A few weeks ago the director of education wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I feel I should draw your attention to the recent campaign in support of seeking Grant-Maintained Status at Notre Dame school in Sheffield. The 'Pro' campaign, led by the Headteacher, Governing body and Diocesan Commissioner produced and circulated between them 9 separate 'campaign' documents all sent to parents. I enclose a section of one of these documents with which we, as an LEA, take particular exception.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The LEA response is, in fact, created by the person(s) constructing this paper; the LEA has not been given the opportunity to reply in writing to any of the written points in this paper."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the LEA sent a document to each parent in the city a few months prior to the Notre Dame ballot in which it tried to inform them of the benefits of the LEA schools remaining with the LEA, and that some of the comments in it were so scathing that when I sent it to the Department for Education it examined it to see whether it was in breach of the code of practice? I remind the hon. Gentleman that if he intended to give as an example an authority that has campaigned regularly in every respect against grant-maintained status he has chosen one such authority, Sheffield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. I do not seek to defend information put out by anybody that is not balanced or objective, or is misleading. My amendment relates to information given by schools that seek grant-maintained status being balanced and accurate. The hon. Lady's remarks do not detract from my example. Perhaps she will say whether she applauds the document put out by the governors of the school that included a reference to an LEA's response that was not constructed by the LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. All these schools deal with an authority which campaigns heavily against grant-maintained status, which itself puts our heavily-biased information and which tries with all its might to ensure that parents are not given a fair and accurate picture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is clearly not willing to state that she deplores the document from the governing body of the school.<br><br>
Another example of the sort of information that schools sometimes give came from High Arcal school in Dudley, in the west Midlands. Its document, headed "Grant Maintained Fact Sheet" states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0513">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"If High Arcal were to become a Grant Maintained School, it would continue to be, as now, a State Comprehensive School, delivering quality education to pupils of the full range of ability in the age range 11–16. In its day-by-day life, there would be few obvious differences, but:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Pupils would have more books, equipment, teachers.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Teachers would have more resources, smaller classes.</p></blockquote>
It is possible that part of that will happen, depending on how the governing body chooses to use its budget. We have been told time and time again by the Minister that the additional funds that are made available to a school that becomes grant-maintained are specifically for that school's additional responsibilities. If the Minister is correct, there are not additional funds to ensure that the school automatically has more books, equipment, teachers and resources and smaller classes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall remind the hon. Gentleman of an exchange that we had many sittings ago. I could look it up, but I shall not do so at this stage. I quoted an extract which had been used by the Secretary of State, so it obviously must be accurate. It summarised an inspector's report and stated that, to date, the vast majority of grant-maintained schools had been able to supply better and more books and equipment and to provide generally higher standards. The findings—objective as ever—were that grant-maintained status provided the things that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The statement that he discussed can therefore be validated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention, which I expected. He has referred to that evidence in the past. I shall not argue the truth of the research. My point is that it is not axiomatic that such things will occur if a school becomes grant maintained, as the document implies. The research document to which the Minister referred also suggests that some grant-maintained schools have not had such increases. The Minister must come clean about whether the additional funds which grant-maintained schools will receive in future under the proposals which he is putting forward are merely to provide for additional responsibilities or whether it is intended to further subsidise grant-maintained schools and give an additional bribe to try to persuade schools to follow the path which the Government want them to take.<br><br>
There was much debate earlier about the information provided by local education authorities being biased and intimidating. There is evidence that some school governing bodies are providing inaccurate and biased information to parents and I have given a couple of examples. My amendment would ensure that the information which will be made available to parents is "balanced, objective and accurate." The amendment would not prevent a governing body from making its conclusion about whether to go for or to oppose grant-maintained status clear to parents involved in a ballot, but it would require the governing body to provide balanced information.<br><br>
Over the past couple of days, I have talked about the amendment to a range of organisations such as the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of County Councils and the National Association of Governors and Managers. They all feel that it is important that the information which is put forward is "balanced, objective and accurate", as the amendment states. I hope that Conservative Members will accept the amendment. If they wish to maximise the number of grant-maintained schools by any means, they will oppose it. But if they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
genuinely wish to ensure that parents make informed decisions on this important matter, I hope that they will support the amendment. Conservative Members should bear in mind that parents who receive information from governors will assume that it is accurate and can be relied on.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
Will Conservative Members bear in mind also that a governing body is in a powerful position because parents respect it? Governors have easy access to the distribution of information through what is colloquially called pupil post. Because of the governors' powerful position, it is important that the information that they send out does not mislead parents or is inaccurate. I hope that the amendment will receive the support of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I decided to speak as I thought that Conservative Members might support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. The amendment involves an elementary principle that should receive the support of both sides of the Committee. I hope that Conservative Members will read it. It requires governors to
<br><blockquote><p>"take all reasonable steps to ensure that such information is balanced, objective and accurate."</p></blockquote>
Even Conservative Members who support the move to grant-maintained status should be able to support that basic principle concerning the quality of information given to parents.<br><br>
How can anyone on the Committee oppose the principle of giving parents information on both sides of the argument? As the hon. Member for Bath said, governors will have their own views which they will make known by deciding to hold an opt-out ballot. They will also be able to put the governing body's view at meetings which they may call and in leaflets to which they put their names, and by recommending an opt-out if that is what they want. If the Government do not accept this straightforward amendment, they must be afraid of allowing parents to hear both sides of the argument.<br><br>
It would be strange if the Government did not accept amendments designed to ensure that parents receive full and accurate information. If they are unwilling to accept this amendment, they are probably determined to rig the system even more in favour of opt-outs, which is their preferred option.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath referred to the school in Sheffield that circulated to parents nine documents promoting opt-out. The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye was annoyed that Sheffield council had tried to make its views known to parents. I do not object to people who promote an opt-out giving parents their views, so why should those who promote an opt-out object to parents, councillors or governing bodies who oppose an opt-out doing likewise? The amendment would allow both sides of the argument to be put fairly and squarely before parents.<br><br>
What was objectionable about the Sheffield case was the document, which purported to be a well-balanced, question-and-answer session, using the words "LEA response", yet that so-called LEA response was actually written by those promoting an opt-out. That is a disgrace and cannot be defended. If the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye wants to defend it, I should be happy to give way to her. If those promoting the opt-out wanted to use the LEA's own words, they could have asked it to produce the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
document or could have taken examples and phrases from previous LEA documents. No one can defend the con—that is the only way to describe it—of parents putting in their own words under the phrase "LEA response".<br><br>
Many of us could give examples from our constituencies of other abuses. I ask the Minister to comment on a particular problem in one school in the north-west. The list of parents was denied to one parent who opposed opt-out until four days after the ballot had started and the ballot papers had gone out. We all know that many people fill in ballot papers as soon as they arrive. The school then had the cheek to try to charge the parent £19 for the list that was being provided and, in a letter to other parents, criticised that parent for opposing opt-out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In such a case, I should be interested to know whether the parent had troubled to contact my Department. When such difficulties arise and the parent contacts my Department, we then contact the school and the list is made available in every case; therefore, whether through inefficiency or malevolence, parents have the simple route open to them which I have just described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that information. It suggests that we should perhaps table parliamentary questions on the number of such cases. Obviously, the Department for Education has recognised procedures for dealing with those abuses. However, not all parents have the telephone number of the DFE or even the confidence to telephone the DFE with any expectation of success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If such parents are as anxious as the hon. Lady suggests, they can approach their Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many actions that parents can take. One of their fears is that, if they cause too many ripples, there may be retribution and their children may suffer. They fear the kind of letter that was sent out in the case in the north-west in which the head criticised the individual parent in a comment to all parents in the school. The Minister must not dismiss that example by saying that the parent could have solved the problem. That parent must have feared for the way in which the child would be treated in school in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister's comment on the ability of parents to go to the Secretary of State. I wonder whether my hon. Friend is aware of the parliamentary question that I put to the Minister on 12 November:
<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Education—how many formal complaints he has received from parents … alleging misconduct by a headteacher or governing body during the holding of a parental ballot on grant-maintained status."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State did not reply. He left it to the Minister, whose answer was:
<br><blockquote><p>"This information is not available centrally."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. <i>893.</i>]</p></blockquote>
It is clear that there is no formal procedure for dealing with such matters. That is why the Bill must be amended to give real power and rights to parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The information provided by my hon. Friend is very interesting. Given what the Minister said this afternoon, it might be appropriate to table those questions again and get the facts. Either a hotline exists
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
that some of his officials do not know about, or what the Minister has told the Committee this afternoon is somewhat misleading. It is well worth pursuing the matter.<br><br>
The amendment would require that the information sent out by governors be accurate, I have a vested interest in supporting the amendment because of one of my constituents. Last year a ballot was held at Earlsheaton high school in my area. One of the school's governors, who has been co-opted on to the governing body because of his respected position in the local community, telephoned me to tell me about his experiences when the ballot was held. Unknown to my constituent, the school sent out a letter by the usual method of pupil post. That meant that every parent got the letter, including those who had asked to be taken off the list—a means by which those who promoted opt-out could ensure that all parents received their propaganda, but not information from those who advocated a different case. My constituent was concerned that the letter given to him by his child in support of opt-out included a list of supporters. The first name among those supporters was his own—Colin Cooper. As a governor, he had not supported the proposal to opt out and he was alarmed at that development. He telephoned the school's head teacher, who supported the opt-out move. The head teacher apologised and said that it was an oversight: the intention had been to ask Mr. Cooper, but the proposal's supporters had not got round to it.<br><br>
My constituent requested similar access to post facilities so that a leaflet could be circulated among parents disassociating him from support from the proposal. Not surprisingly, that request was refused. The ballot result was very convincingly against opting out, and the head teacher and supporters of the proposal were not very happy. When new members were co-opted on to the governing body, surprise, surprise, Mr. Cooper was not among them. That is an example of the way in which misleading information can be sent to parents without any attempt to be even-handed.<br><br>
I am also worried about a recent example of how information which may be misleading and inaccurate but which is certainly not even-handed has been sent to parents of children attending Blatchington Mill school in East Sussex. I must admit that, when I first heard of that school—whose chairman of governors is called David Taylor—I was worried about the authenticity of the information. However, we have checked, and it is a genuine case.<br><br>
The governors of Blatchington Mill school have sent out a letter that presents the case for and against opting out. However, the governors clearly recommend opting for grant-maintained status. The chairman of governors has sent a further letter to every parent, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This week we have visited the Department of Education to discuss the matter with the Secretary of State, John Patten, and his officers".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A meeting with him?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an achievement. It may explain why the Secretary of State could not be in Blackpool. The letter states that the purpose of the meeting was to clarify points that worried the governors. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"These are detailed in the Appendix on Funding … If you vote 'Yes' to Grant Maintained Status, we will initiate two changes with effect from September 1993:
<ol>
<li>We will employ extra teachers to reduce class sizes.</li>
<li>We will purchase extra resources for students for use."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
I have two concerns about the letter. The Secretary of State said that he would judge every application for grant-maintained status on its merit and that he could not prejudge the outcome. The Under-Secretary wrote to me to deny a statement that a Conservative councillor in my constituency made. The councillor claimed that the Secretary of State had given him specific assurances, yet, in the case that I describe, the Secretary of State compromises his position by meeting the governors to clarify
<br><blockquote><p>"points which previously were giving us concern",</p></blockquote>
which are detailed in the appendix on funding. The Secretary of State is so worried about the failure of the movement towards grant-maintained status that he attempts to prop up his policy by implying to schools that he will favour them if they take a particular route. He has tried to influence the ballot in the case that I described.<br><br>
If that is true, the Secretary of State cannot claim to be impartial when he judges the educational merits of the case. I am interested to know what advice the Secretary of State gave the governors. I hope that the Under-Secretary can tell us. The implication of the letter is that the Secretary of State has assured the governors that if the school becomes grant maintained, it will be able to employ extra teachers and purchase extra resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that a school in East Sussex has the nerve to challenge its local education authority which is an embarrassment to me.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's point strikes at her fundamental lack of knowledge about grant-maintained schools. If a school becomes grant maintained, it automatically acquires additional sums from the money that the LEA would otherwise receive. The school can therefore decide without prejudice to the Secretary of State or any other discussions that it may have, how it will spend the extra money in its budget. That is precisely what the chairman of governors did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has always said that schools which become GM schools will receive the equivalent of the administrative costs of their other responsibilities. That is what the compensation is supposed to be for.<br><br>
I accept the comments of the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye about East Sussex. She said that the Conservative-controlled education authority in East Sussex is often an embarrassment to her. The Government are often an embarrassment to the authority in East Sussex and suggestions have been made—one Conservative councillor has been vocal—about the attempted intimidation of Conservative councillors by Conservative "radicals" or those anxious to promote GM status. Whatever the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye and other Conservative Members think about particular cases, they cannot criticise this amendment which asks for even-handed information.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell us, when he receives the information, whether he accepts that the Secretary of State made the promises alleged in the letter and whether the Secretary of State acted properly when he met governors who were actively taking part in a ballot. I hope that we will receive an answer not least because, on other occasions, the Under-Secretary said that the Secretary of State should never prejudge any issue.<br><br>
Ministers in the Department for Education have tried to stop both sides of the case being presented on other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
occasions. They have complained about the role of chief education officers who have expressed their views, at the request of their councils, to parents involved in opt-out ballots. In the case of the chief education officer in Bolton, the Baroness Blatch used extreme language about his approach being vindictive and not being that expected of a professional. Similar words have been used in other cases in Cleveland and Nottingham. However, it is significant that, when the DFE was asked to provide evidence of a complaint in Nottingham, the official in the Department had to write:
<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to your request that I identify any evidence or complaint that has been laid regarding intimidatory action, I confirm that the department has received no information."</p></blockquote>
In circumstances such as that, Ministers are obviously becoming paranoid about the failure of the grant-maintained movement and they are using every example in an attempt to intimidate anyone who is against grant-maintained status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to remind the hon. Lady again that the evidence that I produced this morning was provided by the DFE in its new sheets and it clearly shows that Bolton, Salford, Sheffield, Bradford, Cleveland, Havering and Hammersmith and Fulham have all been required by the Department to explain items, such as letters and fact-sheets, that they have sent out—I have an example which is entitled a "fact-sheet".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have advised the Committee that interventions should be brief, especially as there is now a timetable motion in effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention will be brief, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I consider that the hon. Gentleman's intervention is just right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We also admire your judgment in these matters, Mr. Martin. I did not intend to mention again the information that the Minister sends out; I would have to apologise in the Nottingham example, where it was clear that no complaint was made and no intimidation occurred. Ministers would have wanted to keep quiet about their record regarding letters to chief education officers. Suffice it to say that, in Bolton apparently the only complaint to the Department for Education was not from a parent voting in the ballot or from a governor of either school involved but from the headmaster of a grant-maintained school who dabbled in interfering to influence a ballot. Ministers do not appear to have complained about that political activity or interference—again, obviously because it suits their objective.<br><br>
The complaints about the situation in Bolton were ridiculous, not least because the chief education officer's letter began:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Parent</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The governors of the school, as part of their wish to have a full debate on 'opting out', have given me the opportunity to write directly to you to explain why I think your school should remain part of the local schools system."</p></blockquote>
The governors gave the chief education officer the opportunity to write to parents, but because he did not agree with the Secretary of State, he was criticised and received abusive letters from departmental officials and abusive press releases from Baroness Blatch.<br><br>
The amendment is the minimum for which we should ask.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it fair of the hon. Lady to accuse the Department of Education of sending abusive letters? I have a copy of that letter, which is not abusive in any way. I shall, of course, accept your ruling, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Department has a broad back and can take criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have obviously touched a sensitive nerve among Conservative Members. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If they cannot stand that criticism, perhaps those letters should not have been written.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady aware that not only does the Department of Education send such letters as she described but the Secretary of State himself has given instructions to his correspondence section to send an offensive letter to one of my hon. Friends?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard about that. I understand that words were scribbled on the letter that the reply should be offensive. I understand that in a reply to one of the Minister's ministerial colleagues in another Department, it was suggested that the response be "robust". It would be interesting to see the full correspondence. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, who previously put material in the House of Commons Library, would consider doing so again to give us the benefit of a full appreciation of this correspondence.<br><br>
I do not wish to take up more of the Committee's time. I simply wish to say that if Conservative Members cannot accept that parents are entitled to hear both sides of the argument, they are clearly frightened of the case being put against opting out. That is why it is important to take the amendment seriously. If Ministers will not accept it, we shall divide the Committee on it.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had some good debates, among which I would include the previous one, but this debate has become one of the more absurd, thanks largely to the contribution that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor). The debate on the amendment began on a fairly innocuous form of words suggested by the hon. Member for Bath. The hon. Member for Dewsbury went overboard to prove that those words are necessary. The amendment is necessary only if she can prove that abuses have been taking place, so we had all that nonsense about meetings with the Secretary of State.<br><br>
What have the advocates of the amendment come up with? They have come up, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye has said, with the perfectly reasonable case, put forward by the governors of Blatchington Mill school in Hove, that, if the school becomes grant-maintained, it and its governors will have a greater say over its spending priorities. Those governors decided that, should the plan be accepted, they would spend more on teachers and on the other items mentioned. That does not represent interference in the process by the Secretary of State. All that the Secretary of State has done, if he has met those people, is to clarify the point of law, as is his duty. It is the governors' responsibility to find out about it if they are uncertain. That is an example of responsible governors putting a responsible case. It does not in any way suggest that the amendment is necessary.<br><br>
It must be noticed that the Labour party, of which the hon. Member for Dewsbury is a Member, has not tabled any amendment along the lines she advocates and neither
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
she nor any of her colleagues added their names to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. They did not show any support until this moment. We might be more influenced if she—and the hon. Member for Bath—had tabled an amendment requiring the same balance, accuracy and impartiality from the LEAs. However, they did not. The amendment would merely impose a one-sided requirement on the governors. I do not object to that, or to the form of words in itself, should it prove necessary, but I shall return to that matter in a moment.<br><br>
The hon. Lady went through the business of the parent who was charged, I think she said £19, for a list of parents. If that is the case and if it can be shown to be excessive—more than the cost price of a photocopy of the list—it would be in breach of the law. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has already pointed out, all the amendment does is to repeat existing law as set out in the Education Reform Act 1988. That legislation was already in force when the constituent approached the hon. Lady or her colleagues. I would assume that they would have referred the matter, if they were uncertain, to the Department, which would have given the necessary guidance. That parent could have had justice long before today. It is something of a shame for those parents that they have not had justice and that their constituency representatives did not take up the cudgels on their behalf. That is the representatives' fault, not the parents', and certainly not the fault of the current legislation, which can be used to provide that justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point about parents who for some reason do not receive the parental register to which they are entitled. If a parent does not receive a list, what powers does the Secretary of State have to remedy the situation? As I understand the 1988 Act and this Bill, no powers are given to the Secretary of State to force the disclosure of the register, for example, or to take any further action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may confirm this, but I should have thought that the Secretary of State would draw the matter to the attention of the governing body and perhaps the LEA too, to ensure that the list was sent out. The Secretary of State would take into account any such discrepancies, and whether the proper procedures had been complied with, when the case for grant-maintained schools was presented to him. The point in this case was not that the list was not produced, but that, eventually, it was produced at an exorbitant cost. That could have been taken up by that parent's Member of Parliament.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dewsbury said that we ought to have lists. We have just heard one of her colleagues arguing that we ought not to have lists. The Labour Members are confused about this. One minute they say that there should be lists and amendment No. 445 even suggested that an offence would be committed by a governing body if a list was not produced within three days. I know that the amendment was not moved, but nevertheless, the hon. Lady—who is studiously avoiding listening—put forward such a view when she put down that amendment. The Labour party needs to get its act together and make clear its view on the provision of information for parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not it seem strange that the Labour party, presumably having addressed its mind to the legislation, takes a duty so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
seriously at one moment that it is prepared to make it a criminal offence not to complete it, then, in another moment, drops the idea, does not move the amendment and even has a Labour member of the Committee argue against it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has stated the point exactly. I hope that, given a little more time, the Labour party will be able to make sure that its case is at least consistent over a couple of pages of amendments.<br><br>
The amendment deals with the requirement for accuracy and a balanced view. No one would dissent from those aims, which we would expect to be pursued. The only case for amending the Bill to that effect is if it can be shown that there have been widespread abuses by governors. I do not think that any such case has been brought forward.<br><br>
Undoubtedly, there is a difference of opinion in the Committee about what a balanced argument may be. One man's bias is another man's balance. Such words are hard to define, but nevertheless, we all agree with having a balanced view as an objective. As my hon. Friend the Minister said in an intervention, the majority of cases show that, in practice, benefits have come already to the grant-maintained sector. If a school feels that such benefits could be expected should it go grant-maintained, my hon. Friend's case is reasonable.<br><br>
The suggestion that it was outrageous for a governing body to put forward its view, for the LEA to counter it and for the recommendation to be made in favour of the governing body is pressing the case too far. If the governing body comes to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the school, the parents, the pupils and the community that the school should seek grant-maintained status, it would be a neglect of duty if the governing body did not point that out—and provide the rest of the information—to the parents involved in the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman deliberately intends to mislead the Committee, but he has misunderstood our criticism of that action. The governing body put out the views that it attributed to the LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter and I shall come back to it. The hon. Member for Dewsbury suggested that it was wrong for the governing body of the Blatchington Mill school to stress that it was in favour of opting out. I question the hon. Lady's outrage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span> <i>indicated assent.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to note that the hon. Member for Bath agrees. The governing body should put forward its view as strongly as it likes, as well as putting the balanced case.<br><br>
In conclusion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way? He has not answered my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am about to answer it. If the governing body was required under the amendment to put forward the balanced, accurate and impartial case that it believes to be fair and right and was then given a distorted and inaccurate view by the local education authority, would not the governing body have a duty to put the LEA case in a more balanced way or to reject that information as inaccurate? Perhaps the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) would like to consider that. Under the amendment, there is no requirement on the LEA to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
balanced and accurate, but perhaps that requirement lies behind the suggestions relating to the way in which the LEA case should be put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of the guidelines issued to LEAs by the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker). In effect, they already place a requirement on LEAs to provide balanced, fair and accurate information. That might have been abused in certain circumstances—we shall return to that later. But surely the hon. Gentleman is not proposing voting against the amendment because it contains nothing about the information and documentation put forward by the LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that that advice exists, but there is no statutory requirement on an LEA to provide fair and accurate information. The governors should, of course, put forward a balanced case but so should the LEA, which has a duty to put its case through the governing body.<br><br>
Will the hon. Member for Bath explain how his proposal would work? We should go back to the point when the hon. Gentleman's words were fairly innocuous, before the hon. Member for Dewsbury took us into the stratosphere of exaggeration. The hon. Gentleman should show not only that there is a case to be made, but how to define the terms, who will define them, who is the arbiter, who has the right of appeal and to whom. The amendment does nothing more than express a pious hope, and pious hopes do not make for good legislation, even if one agrees with the sentiment behind them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press this point but the hon. Gentleman promised to answer this question and he has not done so. What is his view about a governing body putting out information that it purports has come from the LEA but which the governing body made up itself?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a governing body made up information, I would hold no brief for that body. But if it explained in good faith what it believed the LEA's view to be, and said that the LEA had expressed a view opposite to its own—even though that is not necessarily the form of words that has been used in Committee—that would be reasonable. But nobody would accept or advocate a governing body making up fictitious information.<br><br>
I await with interest the response of the hon. Member for Bath. His proposal needs some explanation because it is unnecessary and unworkable. I ask the hon. Member for Dewsbury to take her hon. Friends into a little back room so that they can get their act together and not table contradictory amendments on the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This really has been a most illuminating afternoon; we have discovered a number of things. The more I read the clause, however, the more I see the grubby fingerprints of the Secretary of State for Education on it. The clause is suffused with his theology—his desire to promote fear of hell rather thanlove of God. That is precisely what this is about.<br><br>
It shook me when the Minister said it but we all heard him say that the ballots are subject to widespread abuse. He said that he could be telephoned at any time and that he would put the matter right. If things have to go to the Minister to be put right, a closer definition is needed than that in the Bill.<br><br>

6 pm<br><br>
The strange, naive realism of the hon. Member for Chelsea—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Chelsea is now known as north Battersea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, I meant the hon. Member for Battersea. He thinks that a single view can be taken and there will be no difficulties. The difficulty with this Bill and many others is that there must be a synthesis between individual difficulties and open democracy, as the Minister said. Those difficulties are not insurmountable.<br><br>
I want to concentrate on voluntary aided schools and the difficulties encountered by the governing body of the Notre Dame school in Sheffield. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Battersea condemned the document which was set out so as to suggest that it included the genuine LEA response. That document stated why the school should become grant maintained and gave the LEA response. However, nowhere in that paper did it state that that "response" was a summary of what Notre Dame governors considered to be the LEA's response. I shall give the Committee a taste of what the document said. It started by stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"The City Council's mismanagement and inefficiencies, in addition to cuts enforced by central government, have led to £7m cuts last month and?£50m cuts next year.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The major part of the City Council's budget is education.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Our schools cannot take budget cuts without losing staff. If we lose staff we see curricular standards decline; children do not receive their entitlement, a downward spiral ensures that cannot be reversed."</p></blockquote>
I say nothing about the grammar and punctuation in that paragraph. The document continued under the heading "LEA response"—according to the governors of Notre Dame school Sheffield:
<br><blockquote><p>"The City Council has a strong commitment to education and protected the schools' budgets in last month's cuts. The commitment will continue. Trust us."</p></blockquote>
Much better English, but an absolute travesty of the statement made by Sheffield city council, as the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye would agree. The document continued in similar vein throughout; for example:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our secondary schools cannot take further budget cuts because we"—</p></blockquote>
Catholic schools—
<br><blockquote><p>"have been disadvantaged in the past and have not received a fair deal from the LEA".</p></blockquote>
I worked in Catholic schools when I had a proper job and I am familiar with that criticism. However, there is a good reason for it. In cities, especially, Catholic school populations now tend to come from better-off areas than in the days when my grandparents, who were Irish immigrants, and my parents were contributing their pennies and ha'pennies. Catholics have come up in the world since then. However, in some places—it is particularly true in Wakefield metropolitan district—schools serve desperately poverty-stricken areas. Those schools need help because of the social deprivation in those areas.<br><br>
If I am grateful to the Secretary of State for one thing in the lists that he published last time, it is that a school that served the worst area covered by Wakefield metropolitan district council, whose kids had criminal records and every possible disadvantage, achieved remarkable results.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman would assist me greatly if he stayed a wee bit closer to the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, in assisting me to relate that information to the amendment. My point is that propaganda from governors includes false information. It can be countered if people are given a reasonable opportunity to obtain information.<br><br>
The Notre Dame document, which contained the LEA response, also stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, All Saints and Notre Dame do come out worse in terms of per pupil funding. This is not 'getting at' the R.C. secondary sector. It is a conjunction of accidents and would occur for any school that had a small floor area and was full. Only now are we told of the problem (a dispute of fact—the schools maintain that they have complained since 1990)."</p></blockquote>
All that was put down as though it was the response of the LEA of Sheffield. The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye, whose opinion of that LEA is so low, would not express herself in such appalling terms.<br><br>
What worries me about the document is not that the LEA should have the right to reply. Those schools are voluntary aided and up to a couple of years ago got on very well with the LEA. I am worried by the fact that the alternatives put forward by the Bishops' Schools Council of England and Wales were not mentioned. I shall quote from <i>The Universe.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may smirk at a Catholic newspaper, but he should read it. It has much to say and contains some pungent criticism of the Minister's approach to his duties. He should read it, and the <i>Catholic Herald.</i> Bishop Malone told <i>The Universe</i>:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Archdiocesan Schools Commission has concluded that it could not support Grant Maintained Status at the present time, not least because the financial incentives being offered served unhelpfully to foster in individual schools a spirit of self-interest, which runs counter to the very philosophy of life we try to teach in them".</p></blockquote>
The same edition of that newspaper contained the following comments from a parent involved in the shenanigans with the governors of Notre Dame, Sheffield. Mr. Bob Lyons, in a letter entitled "Missing Values", wrote
<br><blockquote><p>"With reference to <i>The Universe's</i> article … it is perhaps appropriate that the first reason given for opting out of LEA control in Sheffield should represent the politics of the playground—'they started it'. The 'under-funding' alleged against Sheffield LEA is more perceived than real, and so if the LEA is destroyed by GMS, it is us—the first secondary schools in the city to go for it—who will be seen to have started it.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The second reason given is more worrying. Sheffield is in trouble and so we cut and run. Even if we have no debt of loyalty to our own city, Christian charity suggests we should stay and help. Other options could and should have been considered for the good of the city as a whole.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>But the most worrying aspect is that educational values are not mentioned at all."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely true: not once are educational values mentioned in the document. The letter continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"What educational value is there in opting out, except to teach our children that we should put ourselves first and let the devil take the rest?"</p></blockquote>
That is a fair summary of a lot of Catholic thinking on the matter. I should like to go through a list which, if there is to be a balanced view—I agree with the hon. Member for Battersea that nobody can put forward an independent view—all three views should be allowed to go to the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman. I cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
understand why he is concentrating on the wording of the amendment and not explaining why the original subsection (6) should not remain. The original wording of subsection (6) has important points that ought not to be left out. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why amendment No. 353 would cast aside those important points?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it has cast aside those points. Subsection (6) states that the governing body may promote—incidentally, it is so nice to see "may" instead of the regularly misused "can", although I would rather have "must". Subsection (6) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body may promote (otherwise than as part of the arrangements made for the ballot) the case for seeking grant-maintained status for the school".</p></blockquote>
In other words, there is only one side of the argument that may or must be put. Hitherto, all governors have taken subsection (6) to mean that it is only the one side of the argument that should be put. That is very wrong and I seek to have that changed.<br><br>
I also wish to change the ability of voluntary-aided schools—or, indeed, any schools—to put out documents that do not face up to some of the problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman has addressed the point. The original subsection (6) separates the case being put—reasonable and fair as it may be—from the arrangements for the ballot itself. That is not in amendment No. 353. I do not understand why it is not there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not there because I did not table the amendment—a perfectly good reason. What is more, we have had sufficient evidence from the Minister that when he accepts an amendment, he does not accept its wording, which is entirely reasonable, but takes its spirit. I hope that the Minister will take the spirit of what we are saying here. If one goes the whole hog in order to have a grant-maintained school, it is right to say, "We'll have 75 more teachers next year, every kid will have his or her own equipment, everything will be brought up to date, the flowers in the garden will grow wonderfully and all this will happen after the school becomes grant-maintained." I have no objection to that.<br><br>
On the other hand, I do object to the fact that people, including governors, support grant-maintained status without facing up to some of the difficulties that occur. Let me give an example. Even now in the south-east, there is bankruptcy trouble with at least one school. What will happen when schools go bankrupt? How will that be faced by the governing bodies, the parents and the Ministry? Will there be a secret rescue? Should schools be taking out policies with Lloyd's, for example, to save themselves from bankruptcy? In so doing, they may send several Conservative Members into bankruptcy.<br><br>
Serious questions—such as what would happen to the pupils if a school went bankrupt—must be faced. Let us take the example of this voluntary-aided school. The document does not state anywhere, "You are opting out of being voluntary aided." It does say that there may be difficulty later, and it contains the splendid sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"Not establishing another LEA but answering the needs of the schools, to who it would be accountable, and brokering to get the best terms for schools for services bought in from outside."</p></blockquote>
6.15 pm<br><br>
It is full of such good English. As to the voluntary-aided sector, under the heading "LEA response" it states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We understand the attraction. A future Government might remove the Church's influence … if the Church is getting its influence for free."</p></blockquote>
Under the heading "Counter-response"—whenever the local authority has a good argument, a counter-response appears underneath—it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If a future Government is so minded, it will do this anyway. But the Church continues to own the buildings."</p></blockquote>
That is correct. Of course the Church will continue to own the buildings, but the school will remain a grant-maintained school.<br><br>
If there are spare places in the state sector, those are the places that will be filled and voluntary-aided schools must look to the long-term future. That is one of the canons of the Bishops' Schools Council which says—and there is no mention of it in the document—that voluntary-aided Catholic schools should consult publicly the diocesan trustees. They should look to the long-term future, not just to current financial matters.<br><br>
There is no mention of that or of all schools in the area—not just Catholic primary schools, but the sister schools in the state sector, the Anglican and the Jewish schools—being consulted. That is important, especially coming from the ecumenical wing of the Church.<br><br>
Above all, this wretched document makes no mention of how the school would maintain its Christian character in the community. That must be considered carefully. The Bishops' Schools Council has been firm, when laying down its guidelines, that no Catholic grant-maintained school should recruit from outside its catchment area. However, there is no sign of that in the document because in many ways that works to the detriment of grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
The document is dishonest in the way that it presents LEA arguments. Even worse, it is utterly materialistic. Christian values are not touched upon at all. It is not suffused with the love of Christ, as one would expect from a document emanating from the Hallam Pastoral centre. That simply will not do.<br><br>
There are not just two strands of thinking on grant-maintained status, but three, four and five. Therefore, we must consider urgently how to ensure that as many strands as parents—such as the man from Sheffield—want to put across are included in the information given to parents, so that they can vote in the true and absolute knowledge of what they are doing.<br><br>
We need also to include some explanation of how schools are funded and how they will be funded if they remain in the LEA. The Secretary of State and the Department of the Environment ultimately decide how much money a school receives. We need to explain standard spending assessments. How can we justify funding a child from Kensington or Chelsea, who is not noticeably more deprived than a child in Wakefield or Sheffield, more generously than other children? The formula is wrong. We should examine the problem with that of funding grant-maintained schools. We ask the Secretary of State to present a formula of his own making—we do not wish to tie his hands—and thus allow a thousand flowers to bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke with his usual elegance and eloquence. I followed him closely when he talked about Catholic schools. He referred to some schools in the south, which suffered financial difficulties. Financial difficulties are not restricted to grant-maintained schools. With his encyclopaedic knowledge, the hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0520">Image</span>

will know about Coventry technical college, which was several million pounds adrift. Grant-maintained status or LEA control is no guarantee of accurate accounting.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Martin, for your comments, which brought me to my feet. I did not intend to speak about the amendment—I had decided to contain myself for a little longer and make a longer speech. I know that you are a stickler for accuracy, Mr. Martin, so I draw your attention to the remarks of the hon. Member for Dewsbury. She accused the Department for Education of sending an abusive letter to the director of education and arts at Bolton Metro. By a remarkable coincidence, I have a copy of that letter. If the hon. Lady takes the trouble to read it, she will be forced to agree that it is not abusive. I shall give a brief example of the language in the admirable letter:
<br><blockquote><p>"As a local authority, you have a particular duty to see that the arguments you present for schools remaining under local education authority control are presented in a way which does not mislead parents."</p></blockquote>
That is not abusive. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is necessary not only in order to secure a fair ballot result but also to avoid creating unnecessary anxiety in the minds of parents whose child's school might become grant-maintained if the result of the ballot is affirmative and the proposals are approved."</p></blockquote>
There is no evidence of abuse. The letter is well-written and courteous. It is the sort of letter that you, Mr. Martin, with your wide experience, would expect the Department for Education to produce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a great pleasure to give way to the hon. Lady.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am so grateful to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Why does the hon. Gentleman believe that the chief education officer of a LEA should receive letters from the Department for Education that demand a reply within two weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He would be lucky to get an answer in that time from the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, the hon. Gentleman would not get an answer from the Department in that time. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it was appropriate for the leader of the council to reply to that letter because it was a political letter? If the Department of Education wants to complain about the activities of any officer of any authority, it should write to the leaders of those authorities and not to individual officers who are professionally responsible to their employers and not to the Department for Education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak with the utmost respect because I happen to quite like the hon. Lady—I might regret saying that. She referred to a demand. Let us hear the terms in which that demand was couched.
<br><blockquote><p>"I should be grateful to receive the Authority's comments within the next two weeks."</p></blockquote>
Scarcely a demand, if I may say so. When I receive demands from the Revenue they are not couched in those courteous terms.<br><br>
I am not surprised at the opposition that we have had from the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall give way. I said that it was a pleasure.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A double pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of some of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, we could take this relationship too far, so I shall not intervene in his speech again. Will he deal with my other point because it is relevant? The letter should be viewed in the context of the press release. It is unusual for a letter from an official at the Department for Education to be released. It was accompanied by a press release from the Department—the "Department for Education News" of which the hon. Gentleman is so fond—which was headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Baroness Blatch hits out at Bolton".</p></blockquote>
It says that the Education Minister severely criticised a letter sent to parents by the director of education. Baroness Blatch said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The claims made by Mr. Hughes are typical of the vindictive and malicious tactics being used by some unenlightened education authorities."</p></blockquote>
That is a direct reference to the letter sent by the chief education officer. The statement and, indeed, the heading—"hits out at Bolton"—confirm my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, they do not. The letter from Bolton has the signature of Brian Hughes. Conservative Members may ask me who is Brian Hughes. [HON. MEMBERS: "Who is Brian Hughes?"] Brian Hughes is not the leader or the political head, he is—this will surprise my hon. Friends—the director of education and arts. Who did the Department for Education write to? The same dear Mr. Hughes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may need some leeway to allow him to lead up to the amendment, but I am wondering when he will deal with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Martin, to call me gently to order. I have been following the hon. Lady far too closely and perhaps I have strayed into areas where I should not have trespassed.<br><br>
As I said, I was not surprised at the opposition of the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends. It is typical of the debates that we have had on this subject over a considerable time. It shows how threatened Opposition Members and their colleagues in LEAs feel. It shows the lengths to which they are prepared to go and the time and the amounts of money that they are prepared to spend to prevent schools from cutting the apron strings that secure them to the LEA. It is not right for substantial amounts of ratepayers' or taxpayers' money to be spent on protecting local authority empires or out-dated political dogma.<br><br>
The amendment mentions the need to ensure that information prepared by governing bodies is balanced, objective and accurate. Some governing bodies might be so misguided as to rely upon information that comes from the chief information officer. As we have heard from the hon. Lady's and my examples, such information is flawed. We know that it is inaccurate. When LEAs produce such information they take all appropriate steps to ensure that it is correct but, it is often inaccurate. I described it this morning as black propaganda and I believe that often it is just that. Such information should not be disseminated to parents as it may lead them to make incorrect decisions. They might be inclined to accept it at face value simply because it comes from an official body such as the LEA.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was musing on which was the correct decision and on whether I had guessed correctly where the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0521">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 755</span>
hon. Gentleman's predilections lay, therefore on what to him is impartial advice, or, alternately, whether he is up to "white mischief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question but if I were to follow the hon. Gentleman down that road, you might rule me out of order, Mr. Martin. I had better stay firmly within the rules of order.<br><br>
I attempted this morning to draw attention to the correspondence sent by the Department for Education to no fewer than five LEAs—five official bodies—drawing attention to the leaflets, letters or so-called factsheets that it produced. It is clear that some LEAs display a cavalier attitude to the facts.<br><br>
I have before me—again by a series of remarkable coincidences—the factsheet produced by the city of Salford. It is called a factsheet because the DFE has identified only six separate items, in four factsheets, that require detailed clarification by the Department for Education. Clearly, the dissemination of such information helps no one. It does not assist parents or schools, and it does nothing for LEAs. Not only does this information discredit Salford LEA, but I fear that other LEAs that have greater regard for the facts will also get tarred with the same brush, which would be unfortunate.<br><br>
The fact that information is produced by an LEA does not necessarily mean that it is correct. There is no guarantee of accuracy, as we have shown. The lesson that we should learn is that LEAs can produce biased or prejudiced information. Therefore, I urge parents to take advice about such information.<br><br>
I should like to question the costs incurred in the production of such leaflets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the helpful encouragement of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). I am genuinely concerned about the cost of some of the material produced by LEAs which I feel is neither fair nor reasonable. Furthermore, the material produces a biased picture that cannot always be answered by grant-maintained schools because they may not always have the appropriate funds to enable them to respond to the black propaganda of some LEAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) complained about the amount of local education authority expenditure on such leaflets, but this afternoon the Minister referred to a Department for Education booklet entitled "How to Become a Grant-Maintained School".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one fundamental difference. The information produced by the Department for Education is accurate, but that produced by some LEAs is inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the solution to that problem is for LEAs to produce a leaflet entitled "How to stay an LEA school", production of which could be funded by county councils and LEAs throughout Britain. That leaflet could also be sent to the schools and a balanced picture could result from it going before governing bodies.<br><br>
If I move from consideration of Bolton to that of Wales, the irony is that as we talk about costs, Principality county councils are meeting the Secretary of State for Wales in Whitehall. As the Minister will know virtually every county council in Wales must cut £6 million in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
expenditure in the forthcoming year. We have spent hours and hours debating booklets and the details of the proposals when the basis of education is being stifled and made to decline because of such cuts.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth referred to a letter from the DFE to a chief education officer. He claimed that the letter was fair and argued for a balanced view. He said that an accurate, informative and objective view should be expressed by the LEA. That is all that our amendment is about. We ask that the DFE's views and those of the LEAs are presented properly and objectively.<br><br>
In Wales, the initiative for opting out has come mainly from head teachers and not from governing bodies and certainly not from parents. The information that is given to parents and to those who live within the catchment areas of schools is distinctly one-sided. Two points of view should be expressed so that parents can make a balanced judgment when they are voting. We have been told that grant-maintained schools revolve around the democratic process and that there is nothing more democratic than parents balloting on the future of schools. Therefore, it is up to the Committee and the House to ensure that the mechanics of democracy are laid down in the Bill. That is all the amendment would do.<br><br>
Let us take the example of the latest school in Wales that has decided by ballot to opt out—the Stanwell comprehensive school in Penarth, south Glamorgan. The headteacher of the school, Mr. Parker, wrote two letters to parents. The first, written in July, was an ordinary letter setting out the case, but by November he had become much more desperate. He sent what he entitled
<br><blockquote><p>"A personal letter to parents of pupils at Stanwell school from Malcolm Parker.</p></blockquote>
He argued that grant-maintained status would mean
<ul>
<li>"More Books</li>
<li>More Equipment</li>
<li>More Teachers</li>
<li>Improved Buildings".</li>
</ul>
Those are aspirations to which everyone in Wales would look forward.<br><br>
By the time that parents started to write to me about what was happening in that school, the governors and the community were in ferment because of what had been sent to them as information. One governor wrote to me to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are now divided into the 'for' or 'against' camps and the atmosphere is awful. Instead of doing what we were put there for, we are just arguing about procedures and 'nit-picking'. I have put a tremendous amount of time and energy into a parental campaign to persuade people to vote against opting out, but this has left me and the other parents in my group, so emotionally drained."</p></blockquote>
After the ballot had been held and the decision made, a parent, who did not want to be named for fear of possible repercussions on his or her child, wrote to the local newspaper as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not expect school staff to knock my door on a Saturday afternoon to make sure I am voting the 'correct' way; nor do I expect to receive irrational and highly emotive appeals from my child's headteacher on a personal topic of choice which has been aired in many public meetings."</p></blockquote>
The point is that the emotive and highly charged language used to describe the way in which local education authorities are supposed to behave, and in other arguments, is not appropriate for the development of our schools. We should not see the future of education in that way. The amendment would merely calm down the argument so that both sides of the discussion can be advanced and parents can make a reasoned and

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
reasonable choice. If parents are not given that opportunity, the notion that grant-maintained schools are based on the democratic process is nonsensical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fair as I know the hon. Gentleman normally to be, on this occasion he has presented a travesty of the situation in Wales. Is he really casting aspersions on the ballots that have taken place? Is he not aware that the weight of propaganda in Wales has been very much against opting out and in favour of LEA control of schools? Is he not also aware that many LEAs in Wales are flexing their muscles against the grant-maintained concept?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that LEAs in Wales are opposed to the grant-maintained concept and that the weight of opinion opposes it overwhelmingly. The general election showed that. However, the amendment makes no case either for or against grant-maintained schools. It deals with the way in which the ballot is conducted and with the information that is given to parents. If parents receive a fair and balanced account of the arguments for and against opting out, overseen by the Secretary of State, there is no question of disagreement about the conduct of the ballots. The LEAs would also be restrained and constrained by the amendment. Both sides should be heard and what happened in Penarth would not occur anywhere else.<br><br>
There have been a number of ballots in Wales and they have produced different decisions. That is the way democracy goes. The amendment would ensure simply that the process is carried out without the highly charged and emotional atmosphere that has caused such difficulty in Wales and England. The argument about grant-maintained schools should be based on reason and not on the emotional nonsense that we have heard in the past couple of hours from the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, given the lateness of the hour and the fact that the amendment has generated so much discussion.<br><br>
The debate has got a little out of hand. I want to be unbiased, and it appears to me that all hon. Members agree that information should be balanced, objective and accurate. It is difficult for parents to make a valid choice if they do not have such information, but the argument is about from whom that information can be obtained. That is an important question, as the governing body alone has access to the complete list of parents at a particular school.<br><br>
I find it surprising that, in a discipline such as education, which must be unbiased, objective and accurate in the way that it teaches children, we should argue about the need for those values when it comes to dealing with children's futures. If the Government decide to vote against the amendment, that paints an odd picture and conveys a strange message to governing bodies, schools and children, to whom we try to teach objective values.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
I should like to consider the problem of incomplete lists. Some schools in my area are situated near women's aid refuges. Many parents who do not wish to be identified stay at those refuges. Mothers who stay there do not wish the fathers to know where they, or their children, are. Some schools would produce lists from which many names
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
were missing. If the governing body does not supply balanced and accurate information to those parents, it causes grave problems for the school. No one else will have access to the parents to supply such information.<br><br>
What do the Government mean by "choice"? There is no proper choice without balanced and accurate information on which to base decisions. It would be nonsense to suggest that only one side should be allowed to present its point of view in political elections. This country does not operate in that way, although there are attempts in the press to create such a predicament. It is easy to argue for the status quo when backed by the sympathy of the tabloid press, but choice must depend on accurate and objective information.<br><br>
The Government sometimes prevent choice in order to put through Conservative policies. They make it appear that people have chosen such policies of their own free will. For example, housing action trusts were a dismal and spectacular failure. The city technology college programme has been abandoned because industrialists did not choose to create those colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not been abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When is the next one to be created? There is no flurry of such colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next college will be in Battersea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The programme has not been the success that the Government expected it to be. People have voted against it with their feet.<br><br>
The Government made generous predictions about the number of schools that would opt out of LEA control. The predictions have not been realised. If complete freedom does not achieve the right sort of choice, there must be bias. So-called choice can thus fulfil the Government's wishes. It is embarrassing for the Government when the public does not make the choice that the Government would like it to make.<br><br>
Ministers have been influenced by Westminster. Those of us who have worked in local authorities find Westminster's methods strange. That is illustrated by a letter from the former chief education officer of Cambridgeshire that was published in the magazine <i>Education</i> on 18 December 1992. It refers to Baroness Blatch's letters, which have been called abusive, but I have not seen them so I would not like to judge. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is presumptuous of Ministers and civil servants to assume that they have the right to call imperiously to account CEOs, whose accountability is not to them but to the education committee on whose behalf they act. Unlike civil servants whose anonymous advice is given in secret to Government Ministers, CEOs publicly advise the whole committee whose servants they are; they do not simply serve the party that happens to be in control.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>An education officer is conditioned from his/her first day in office to be politically neutral, and professional integrity is the lifeblood of the job, whether advising the committee, a governing body, or parents individually and collectively. It appears that Ministers' ignorance of these fundamentals is exceeded only by their arrogance in their zeal to stifle open debate."</p></blockquote>
A different position pertains in LEAs, which make efforts to ensure that the advice that they give to all political parties is balanced, objective and accurate. The Government are not used to that and can only contemplate the sort of advice that they receive from their civil servants.<br><br>

It is easy for a governing body to get carried away by its enthusiasm for grant-maintained status and to be anxious to promote its views. The amendment does not prevent governing bodies from stating their own views, but it requires them to ensure that people are making a choice based on balanced and objective information. If governing bodies do not feel able to provide well-balanced information, they have the option of bringing in another body to do that for them so that parents get a complete picture.<br><br>
I would like to describe my recent experience on a governing body. A difficult decision was being made about the school that my children attended, Parkside community college in Cambridge. It involved a rebuilding programme and the governing body favoured the school being relocated on its existing site, much against the wishes of the LEA. The governing body was anxious to obtain the views of parents. Some people on the governing body felt that we should try to influence parents by presenting our own views and not those of the other side. I am happy to say that we took the approach that we should present a balanced view and not just the point of view of the governing body. That approach was successful because it resulted in an almost unanimous decision.<br><br>
The advice to governing bodies must be that if they present an accurate and balanced picture, they are more likely to get the decision that they want. They should not try to bounce parents into a decision. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea summed up the matter as well as anybody. I am strongly tempted to refer the Committee to his remarks and sit down. However, given the lateness of the hour, the Committee might allow me a few minutes to round off the debate on this important subject because we must get it straight. It would be wrong to include the words of the amendment in the statute if the same statutory strictures did not apply to local education authorities. The playing field, to use that much overworked analogy, would be tilted in one direction unnecessarily and unjustifiably. It is even more unnecessary if one considers clause 20(6), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body may promote … the case for seeking grant-maintained status for the school and, in doing so, they shall take into account any guidance given by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Such guidance, which will be given by the Secretary of State, will cover many of the points made by members of the Committee and the spirit, if not the wording, of the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the lateness of the hour, it is vital that the Minister responds to the following question: does he accept that the word "promotion" almost always means putting forward only one side of the case? I know of only one example—packets of cigarettes, which state "Buy these cigarettes and they may kill you"—in which both sides of the case are put. In no other case is there such a balance. Will the Minister assure us that the guidelines to which he referred will contain specific reference to the need to put both sides of the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is unlikely and improbable, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. We do not seek to constrain governing bodies that put forward their view, as school governors, to parents on the merits or otherwise of grant-maintained
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
status. We all agree that accuracy is essential and I would expect any guidelines to emphasise that the information provided should be accurate. That covers the point made by the hon. Member for Warrington, South: if any party to the discussions were to present inaccurate information of the kind described by the hon. Gentleman, it would be unacceptable. There is much common ground between us: whatever arguments are put before parents, the information provided should be accurate.<br><br>
The more difficult terrain is that of objectivity or balance, but if, as the amendment proposes, such a requirement is in the Bill, it could be subject to objections and to delaying tactics. That would not be in the spirit of the Bill; it would be obstructive and make the whole process much more difficult. Although we have much common ground in terms of accuracy, the wording in the amendment is not appropriate. Moreover the guidelines that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will introduce under the rubic clause 20(6) will be the equal and opposite of the existing, non-statutory guidelines which cover LEAs. That is how to achieve even-handedness and balance between LEAs and governors of schools. For those reasons, and against the background of my assurances on the guidelines from the Secretary of State, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment. I am even more disappointed that in the guidance to be issued to schools he sees no need to include terms such as balance, accurate and so on. He puts his hon. Friend the Member for Battersea in a dilemma. In his speech, the hon. Gentleman said that he believed schools had a duty to provide balanced, objective and accurate information and the right to tell parents what conclusions they had come to.<br><br>
I mentioned the problem that I envisaged in the use of the word "promotion". Promotion nearly always implies that only one side of the case will be presented. The hon. Member for Battersea asked me the definition of the word. I remind him of the considerable embarrassment suffered by the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) when we discussed the definition of reasonableness. Many words used by the Government need definition. For example, in the parents charter, what is the meaning of the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"If your child has special needs because of disability or other learning difficulties, you have a right to an education which meets any special educational needs your child has."</p></blockquote>
How many children with special educational needs have been able to exercise that right? Why is it that in Government information—hon. Members say that they are concerned about the amount of money being spent on it—there is bias? The only address given for those who want to find out about grant-maintained schools is that of Choice In Education. We know that that organisation only puts forward one particular side of the case.</span></p>
