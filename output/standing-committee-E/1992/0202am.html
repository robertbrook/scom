	<time>Tuesday 2 February 1993</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Last month, we spent some time discussing grant-maintained schools and the procedures that would be adopted if a governing body wanted to consider whether its school should become grant-maintained and suggest a ballot of parents. At that time, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools—who is not in his usual place even though he is in Committee—said in reply to one debate that the Government had no plans, other than those already in the Bill, to change the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Sunday, we read in the newspapers that the Secretary of State intends to bring forward new amendments on that matter in Committee. Apart from the discourtesy of announcements being made through the press rather than to the House or the Committee, I wonder whether any sign has been given to you as Chairman, Mr. Martin, of when we might expect sight of those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, about whose absence we have commented before, does not seem to talk to parents or to teachers. Moreover, from what we read on Sunday he does not seem to talk to his own Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I am moderately surprised and amused that the hon. Lady should raise that point. I seem to recall that on at least one, if not two occasions some time ago, I informed the Committee of our intention to introduce such amendments. The appropriate new clause will be tabled with the usual notice—the amount of notice that the Opposition give us of their amendments and that we have been giving the Committee of our amendments. There is no surprise, no shock and very little horror.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order because the matter has nothing to do with me. It is a matter for the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you will be aware, for some time Opposition Members have drawn attention to what they describe—incorrectly, in my view—as a lack of consultation. What we have heard today clearly gives the he to that. It shows that the Secretary of State is responding to representations. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, certain amendments will be table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point, but it is certainly not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. This is a different matter. On Thursday night, during the final votes in Committee, we had the spectacle of Conservative Members being told how to vote by civil servants from the top table. Would you give a ruling that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1234</span>
it is not in order for people who are not members of this Committee to instruct Conservative Members how to vote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no civil servants in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I seek your guidance. In his point of order, the Minister said that he had on at least one occasion told the Committee that the Government intended to table further amendments on the balloting of school governing bodies. I remember that I specifically asked the Minister whether he had any intention further to alter the ballot procedure and he assured us that he did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, it is a matter not for me, but for the usual channels to try to sort out.

Clause 180 Extension of the Education (Schools) Act 1992</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Timothy Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to
	<br><q><p>move amendment No. 311, in page 104, line 21, leave out 'or voluntary' and insert 'voluntary or grant-maintained'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 312 to 324.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to the amendments, it occurs to me that there might be a case for introducing a procedure for league tables for points of order. We are about to consider part V of the Bill on acceptable standards and failing schools, but most of the points of order made this morning, through ingenious, have not met the test. I shall put them aside and get on with consideration of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 311 is being considered with many other amendments that would have similar effects on different clauses. They are intended to bring grant-maintained schools within the provisions of chapter I of part V of the Bill. They ensure that the procedures for making reports on at-risk schools apply equally to grant-maintained schools—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the hon. Lady's support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such schools will be subject to the requirements of the procedures in the chapter for making action plans in response to inspections and for monitoring and for further inspections when an inspection identifies that the school is in need of special measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was always our intention that grant-maintained schools should be included in the provisions. The initial draft of the Bill did not include that and there was insufficient time to change it before it was introduced. Obviously, we are anxious to put the matter right and I believe that the amendments will do so. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SECTION 9 INSPECTIONS BY REGISTERED INSPECTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 809, in page 105, line 34, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(6A) Where an inspector has been informed under subsection (4) or (6A above that the Chief Inspector agrees with the inspector's opinion, the inspector shall without delay give notice in accordance with subsection (6B) below of—
	<ol>
	<li>that opinion and that agreement, and</li>
	<li>the date on which the report of the inspection and the summary of it are expected to be sent to the appropriate authority.</li>
</ol></p></q>
	<br><q><p>(6B) The notices mentioned in subsection (6A) above shall be given to—
	<ol>
	<li>the appropriate authority and,</li>
	<li>in the case of a maintained school (other than a grant-maintained school) for which the governing body are the appropriate authority, the local education authority.'.</li>
</ol></p></q>
I shall not detain the Committee long because the amendment is simple and straightforward. It is likely to receive the support of all hon. Members. I have made that comment many times before but, sadly, have been proved wrong. I hope that that will not be the case on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible to recognise that a school that is likely to receive an at-risk report should be given plenty of time to ensure that it is ready to handle that report when it comes. We all know that governing bodies and local education authorities cannot meet instantly; they need to have some notice of meetings. When it is known that such a report will come, it would be sensible to give the relevant body—the governing body or the local education authority—advance notice of it and the date of its arrival. That would ensure that a meeting could be called to enable the relevant body to discuss, as promptly as possible, the serious matters involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 103 of schedule 15 refers to arrangements for reports to be completed within a prescribed period. There is nothing new in suggesting that people specify a time scale for documents. Given the way in which the registered inspectors will tender for business and the likelihood that much business will take place in the first two terms, rather than in the third—summer—term, we must recognise that there will be peaks and troughs in the production of the documents. The Education (Schools) Act 1992 refers to two documents—the report of the inspection and the summary. Therefore, when I mention documents, I am talking about both of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing special about a prescribed period, which is already contained in the Bill. I am suggesting merely that advance notice be given so that people can prepare to deal with the documents as quickly as they can because those documents will contain very serious matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will concur with the hon. Gentleman's broad approach. We want the report to be prompt, but we also want it to be thorough and sufficient. Our proposals will meet both criteria. The hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the provision in the schedule regarding the prescribed period. In a straightforward case, when the chief inspector and the inspection body concur,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1236</span>
the inspection should take two weeks and there would be a period of a further five weeks for the preparation of the report. The process would take well within two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, it might be necessary to refer back from the inspector to the chief inspector. That might cause further delay, which would be understandable and in the interests of clarity. Consultation could take place at that point and the school would be informed. However, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment. When the chief inspector agreed with the assessment of the inspector that the school was at risk, the amendment would require the inspector to inform the school without delay and, unless the school was grant maintained, also to inform the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving warning is a good idea in principle and I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Unfortunately, the warning would be one of principle only; there would be no substance to it and no action points. The report would not be available to the school at that stage and there would be no details of why the school was at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right—there is nothing in my amendment that states that the school would get any advance warning of the contents of the report and the summary. It could not take action on such information because it would not have been provided. I fully understand that and I accept the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept what the Minister said about the simple case of complete agreement down the line. If a school thought that there might be a critical report, it would know that it would have the relevant documetation within two months. Therefore, the school would be well advised to ensure that a meeting of the governing body or the LEA was called within a two-month period to enable discussion of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister admitted, the more complex case in which there is an initial disagreement between the HMCI and the individual inspector must be resolved, which will delay the process. In such circumstances, it is important that the relevant body that has to discuss the report has advance notice to ensure that it can plan a meeting. As I said earlier, it is impossible to have meetings at the drop of a hat without proper notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying his point. I think that he will be aware that the clause provides that when there is a dispute or query between the inspectorate or the chief inspectorate, the school will be notified that there is a delay in the process. It will know that something is coming, although it will not know its exact terms because the delay will be due to the need too clarify those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the intention of the amendment, but it imposes a further formal hurdle. For example, it pre-empts an immediate presumption in the newspapers that the school is at risk. It is not a kindness to the school or to its governors to flag that unless and until the substance of the complaint is available, which in a straightforward case will be in the time scale that I gave, or in the case of a delay there will be notification of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we both agree that a clear statement must be agreed between the inspectorate and the chief inspector based on their professional view of what is wrong, and which should be available as soon as possible. I could not advise the Committee to accept the hon. Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1237</span>
amendment, which would include a further formal, unnecessary step that could, in certain circumstances, complicate the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's response. He will make it difficult for several school governing bodies and LEAs to respond effectively and rapidly to the reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister has never been keen to include additional hurdles in the Bill. Nevertheless, my proposal is sensible because it would not only give advance notice to the relevant bodies, but would add another impetus to the registered inspector to ensure that the report was delivered on time. Given that the Minister has accepted my remarks in broad principle, perhaps we can find another way to proceed with the matter at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- ul --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is straightforward and simple. It would clarify what is described in clause 186 as the time that may be prescribed.The amendment states that the time should be at least two years. An action plan must be devised when a section 9 report is issued. Clause 186 deals with action plans, which will have several obectives and prescribed different courses of action to assist a failing school. We believe that a school should be allowed at least two years to effect an action plan. That would reflect the practical reality. It is impossible to turn around a school that has experienced difficulties in less than two years. The steps that have to be taken will often be difficult. They will often require the agreement of teachers and parents because they will mean a radical change in the operation of a school to remedy the defects identified by the section 9 report.

The amendment reflects the difficulties that a school will experience once it has been identified as a school at risk. In the competitive climate that the Government promote to enable the market to operate, a school that is fingered by the inspectors will suffer great problems, even if it has a clear and precise action plan and the resources to implement it. Many of us are worried that schools will not have sufficient resources to implement the plan. In the new spirit of competition in education, one school will prosper to the detriment of another. A school that receives an adverse report will experience grave difficulties.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be circumstances in which two years would not be appropriate, although normally it would be.

a case-by-case basis. Is not the right place for the amendment in subsection (2)? As drafted, the amendment makes that subsection redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with the Committee giving clear guidance. Those members of the Committee who have practical experience of how schools work are aware that two years is the least period that would be required to turn round a school that faces difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point and the spirit of his remarks, but it is not merely a matter of the Committee giving guidance. He has tabled an amendment that would have a legal effect, which is what worries my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned if I am worrying Conservative Members. The amendment states that at least two years will be necessary to turn round a school that has been identified as failing. Private letters were sent last week to schools identified as being at risk and I believe that they were told that the period specified in the amendment is the appropriate length of time. The Bill should state two years, although we recognise that there may be exceptions to that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to reintroduce the troubled subject of lawyers—especially when we have had such a quiet start to the Committee—as I know that the mention of the word will bring hon. Members to their feet. Has the hon. Gentleman considered that the amendment creates plenty of scope for lawyers to get their evil hands upon the clause? Any school that is required to carry out an action plan and special measures within two years will say, "Normally, we would be given two years." Does not that create scope for argument about what "normally" means in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman was not touting for business. It is clear in the Bill that the responsible authority will lay down the period of time. That authority will bear in mind that normally two years would be appropriate but, taking into account all the circumstances, it could say that 12 or 18 months would be appropriate in a particular case. Stating "normally two years" fits in well with the overall effect of the clauses relating to inspection and reflects the practical realities involved. I hope that the amendment will commend itself to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a long speech, but I am horrified by the amendment. On the surface it looks reasonable, but on closer consideration I find it utterly unreasonable. Any school worth its salt will be aware that it has problems long before the inspectors go in. If it is not aware that it has problems, perhaps radical surgery is necessary more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment loses sight of the fact that if children are being denied a good quality education because things are going wrong in the school, that needs to be remedied as quickly as possible. Sometimes that is comparatively easy; sometimes it will involve more radical surgery, especially if the problem involves senior staff such as the head teacher or head of department. It is important to take action as soon as a school is known to be in difficulties. It would be dangerous to agree to the amendment.

I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). The word "normally" would create a lawyer's paradise. It would encourage too many governing bodies to take a leisurely path. When they receive inspection reports they often just go through the motions of dealing with problems rather than getting to grips with the issues involved. The Bill should not encourage a leisurely approach to a very important subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) expressed a reasonable sentiment when he said that governors are likely to be aware of a problem in the school and that it is desirable for them and others involved—including the LEA if it were a maintained school—to do something about it as soon as possible. I am sure that the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) would not dissent from that, although he rightly said that occasionally it might take a little time to pull the school round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East made such a short speech. Subsection (2)(b) deals with special measures and provides that the Secretary of State shall determine the period. Subsection (2)(a) does not mention special measures, so we feel that two years is an appropriate period in those circumstances. I hope that the Minister will clarify the matter for his hon. Friend. Subsections (2)(a) and (b) refer to two different situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point from which I wish substantively to distance myself and Conservative Members is the remark, which the hon. Member for Wallsend tossed out, that this problem was created by allowing the market to operate in schools. We believe that competition helps to achieve standards of excellence. The hon. Gentleman implied that our policies are designed to ensure that some schools fail and I strongly resist that suggestion. This sheaf of clauses will ensure that problems in schools—such problems as occurred under former arrangements—will be dealt with as soon as possible. I am sure that that is the wish of every member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the problems should be tackled quickly. We all agree that those problems should be solved as soon as possible, but a false impression is being given that someone can wave a magic wand and deal with them as if they were capable of solution on a short time scale. Opposition Members want action to be taken as soon as possible, but we should not create the illusion that there is a magic formula that will cure a school of all its ills in a short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are making progress by building up a consensus. I agree with the hon. Lady and I accept that all members of the Committee want these problems to be solved as quickly as possible. That implies that if a problem is tackled quickly it may be a lesser problem than if it were allowed to deteriorate for another couple of years with falling rolls and all the rest. That is not at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady quite properly said that on occasions the problems might take longer to solve. I agree with that. The hon. Lady said also that it would be wrong to give the impression that a magic wand could be waved to rectify the problem immediately. That is not realistic, as I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1241</span>
acknowledged in my remarks to the hon. Member for Wallsend. There is a consensus in the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, less easy to accept is the prescription of a series of hurdles, or even targets, for particular circumstances. If such prescriptions were included in the Bill they might be used to lengthen periods of treatment to that limit, instead of enabling the treatment to take place as quickly as possible. For example, if a journalist is told that he has two months to prepare an article he might take all that time to prepare it, but he will finish it as soon as possible if he knows that his managing editor is looking for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has chosen a good example, but he should consider the quality of the article that is produced. A properly researched article, on which the journalist has had time to work carefully, will be of far higher quality than one that is done in a rush.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from what I said earlier that I do not disagree with that. That example could give rise to a fascinating discussion—which might, Mr. Martin, be rather wide of the amendment—about which type of article takes longer to prepare. Some people consider that the leader articles in the tabloid newspapers are among the finest examples of the journalistic art because of their compression and terseness. Indeed, Lord Chesterfield, when he had written a long letter, used to complain that he had not had time to make it shorter. My point is that to remove external pressure by allowing a long lead for action might not be in the interests of either school or pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is a difference of emphasis. The hon. Member for Wallsend is a distinguished lawyer, which I am not, but with respect to him the amendment may depend on a misunderstanding of the Bill. There are many words in the clause and many references to "periods". By that is meant both periods of notice and periods of action. I fear that the two concepts may have become conflated somehow and I intend to distinguish between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that the Secretary of State shall determine the period within which the action plan must be prepared and sent to specific persons. With reference to my earlier analogy, that is the deadline by which the appropriate authority, as the Bill so eloquently describes it—usually the governors of the school—must prepare an action plan. There will be no messing about; an action plan must be prepared within the deadline period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) both noted, matters may not be straightforward and a complicated case may take a little longer. I understand those reservations as we are dealing with fairly sensitive human problems. The hon. Gentleman clearly feared that the process would be rushed and that corrective action would be inappropriate. We do not want that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) did not speak to his amentmend, but it offers a reasonably practical course of action. We do not want to rush in and impose an education association when the governors of a school of the local education authority are attending to the matter according to the provisions of later clauses. However, we need a clear deadline for the preparation of the action plan as an earnest that something will be done about the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not prescribe a deadline for the conclusion of the action plan because, in some cases, it might be inappropriately short—the hon. Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1242</span>
worry—whereas in others it might be too generous for a fairly simple set of changes. The provision is flexible, but the clause makes it clear that we shall not prescribe a definite period for the carrying out of the action. That is why the clause should stand as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us are still worried by the uncertainty that the clause creates. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'to the funding authority in the case of a grant-maintained school, and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(d)'.</p></q>
The Minister has already tabled amendments to part V of the Bill that would include grant-maintained schools within the processes described by that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that the appropriate authority, which the Minister said would usually be the governing body of the school in question, will respond to a report that it has received by providing
	<br><q><p>"a written statement of the action which they propose to take in the light of the report and the period within which they propose to take it."</p></q>
The Minister has tabled amendments to include grant-maintained schools within the procedure. An LEA-maintained school is required to send a copy of its statement on the report to the local education authority. It would be equally sensible for the governing body of a grant-maintained school to be required by the Bill to send a copy of its statement on the action it proposes to take to the appropriate funding authority. The amendment picks up on the consequences of the amendments that the Minister moved earlier and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment, but I cannot advise the Committee to accept it. I shall explain why and also the distinctions that we are making in the functions of the various bodies. I say that with some diffidence because, as the Committee will know, I was not added to the Committee until consideration of clauses on the funding agency for schools had been approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Copies of all action plans produced by grant-maintained schools will be sent to the chief inspector. Those parties are primarily involved in ensuring that matters are dealt with even though, in executive terms, they are not the appropriate authorities that will carry out the work at first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is about quality assurance, in which the funding authority has no role. That is why I made the point about not having participated in earlier debates in Committee. Because the funding authority has no role in quality assurance, it has no role in considering the action plans or in monitoring their implementation. As stated during the earlier debates, the function of the funding agency relates mainly to the distribution of funds to schools. It is not its job to deliver quality assurance. There
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1243</span>
is no objection to a school sending it a copy of the report if it wants to, but that is not an obligation as it is not strictly the business of the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To anticipate what the hon. Member for Bath, will say, the action plan may refer to a school's funding requirements. That would properly be a matter for the funding agency and that is where my comment about a school's discretion comes in. The school will be able to make its needs known to the funding agency when it bids for capital or special-purpose grants in the normal way. In other words, it will have received the report and prepared an action plan which may be relevant to applications for capital or special-purpose funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be common sense to tell the agency that the problem had been identified, to say how it was to be dealt with and why it required funds. That is an appropriate way to tackle the problem that the hon. Gentleman mentioned without involving the funding agency in the inappropriate role of quality assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for pre-empting my response; he makes my point very well. It is highly likely that a report saying that a school is at risk will require it to take a range of actions, which will in turn require it to seek additional resources to make the necessary improvements. Given that there is a likely connection between the governors plan of campaign and the need to consider the school's resource arrangements, it is vital that the funding authority has information about the school's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not refer to the funding authority's responsibility for schools admission arrangements in a particular area. It is possible that information about what is happening in a school may affect the admission arrangements proposed by the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not refer either to clause 5, which requires the relevant authorities to send information to the Secretary of State. The funding authorities may want to consider reports from several different grant-maintained schools on how to get out of difficulties, it is the only mechanism in the Bill to ensure that examples of good practice can be passed on within the grant-maintained sector. Those are three good, sensible reasons for the amendment. I cannot understand why the Bill requires LEA-maintained schools to send a report to their LEAs, but the same not being required of grant-maintained schools in respect of their funding authority.

Paragraph 11.8 of the White Paper mentioned eight weeks as the time scale from the delivery of the report to the school.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the school has six weeks to do its action plan and the LEA has a further two weeks for comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'and at least two of whom shall be or shall have been a head or a deputy head or a chairman of governors of a school of corresponding status'.</p></q>
Nothing in clause 194 reveals the Government's intentions vis-à-vis the type of people who will serve on the education associations. This probing amendment would give the Minister a chance to tell the Committee a little more about the Government's thinking. I am well aware that on many previous occasions hon. Members on the Opposition Benches have wanted to propose various categories of person who would serve on the different bodies that the Bill establishes. The amendment would do the same by suggesting some of the categories of person who might serve on an education association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a probing amendment, I am much more interested in hearing the Minister's response than in delaying the Committee further at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that this was a probing amendment and rightly identified a theme that has occurred not just in this Committee, but in others of which I have experience—the effort to specify precisely in the Bill the categories of membership of particular bodies. It has generally been the pattern—it will be repeated this morning—for the Government to wish to preserve flexibility when making appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require at least two members of the education association, which must consist of at least five members, to be or to have been
	<br><q><p>"a head or a deputy head or a chairman of governors"</p></q>
of a similar type of school. We believe that there are horses for courses and, depending on the particular problems, different approaches might be taken in making appointments to different education associations and to those that covered more than one school at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I owe it to the Committee to explain how the Government envisage the development of the education associations, bearing in mind the general caveat that I have entered already. I expect members of the education association to be drawn mainly from the local community. There may be exceptions, but we do not anticipate that people will come from long distances away. I expect them to include local business men, professionals and, possibly, parents. They may include heads or former heads who have been successful in similar schools. No one, except within general rules of propriety, is ruled out of consideration for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment implies the question of special expertise. Membership of the association may include people with expertise, specially chosen because of problems identified at a particular school. For example, it may be sensible to appoint a person with specific personnel skills, or accountancy skills, to a school where poor management has been identified; or a professional person with special experience in aspects of the national curriculum in which weaknesses have been identified by an inspection. In addition, the education association will be able to seek support and advice in matters beyond the expertise of its members. The Committee will realise that it is not necessary to put on the board of an education association people with particular expertise. It may be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1246</span>
sensible for the association to draw in outside expertise to deal with a problem. Moreover, it would be impossible for an association to accommodate all interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he means when he says that when an education association lacks specialists in a particular discipline it may bring in outside help? Does that mean that the association will pay fees for that support? If so, will such fees be paid at the normal level of remuneration? We have heard a lot about solicitors, but will they—and barristers and accountants—receive the normal fees for their advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of fees will depend on the particular circumstances. Local expertise will be involved, and local people may well feel that, for reasons of public interest, they can make a contribution to the community in that way. If the hon. Gentleman is worried about having head hunters or management consultants brought in from London, I hope that he will be reassured by the spirit of my remarks. Even if that possibility is not precluded by the clause, it would involve an inappropriate level of expense. Moreover, the education association can establish committees, which may include non-education association members. That represents a widening ripple of expertise for the association to draw on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the Minister for a second time, but the question of fees is important and deserves further clarification. The Minister has not ruled out the payment of fees, although he has implied that it will not often be necessary. However, many schools in difficulties may consider that their problems could be resolved by the use of additional resources. Those schools may wish to resort to outside professional advice but be prohibited from doing so by their budgets. Will the Minister tell the Committee what proposals exist for capping an education association's budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, it is self-evident that an education association must work within the budget that is set for the particular school for which it is operating. The hon. Gentleman appears to suggest that it will need some earmarked funding to use to draw on outside consultants. That is not proposed at the moment, although I have listened to what the hon. Gentleman has said. I stress that such operations will have a local base. We do not intend to put the education association in to act as the managers of the school. The head teacher and staff are very important. For example, problems with staffing may require a change in personnel. That may not happen always, but personnel with expertise may need to be added to the staff so that the school can start operating on a new basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the education associations will not be involved in the management of schools and yet, when he gave evidence to the Select Committee, the Secretary of State said that the education association

If so, who will manage the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made precisely the point that I made. If the education association thinks that the problem—which it will not discharge itself

because it will not actually run or teach in the school—is with personnel in the school, it may have to change the headteacher. If it does that, the new head or deputy head will play a central part in the management of the school. That function must be carried out by the professional staff of the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must agree that dismissing senior staff, such as heads or deputies—or, for that matter, any staff—could have great financial implications for the school; a tribunal might have to be held, incurring considerable costs. Are we to take the Minister at his word that they will come from the school's existing, budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the first will be out of the school's existing budget—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman is perhaps misunderstanding the point. I find it wise to check rather than to give answers on the run. There are two parts—there is the normal recourse to the school's budget, which is appropriate. But, it is also entirely possible to apply for special purpose grants, to which I earlier alluded. In such circumstances, that may be the right way to meet the need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where will the special purpose grants come from? Will they come out of the LEA budget? If so, the money will be taken from other schools' budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extra money and it will go through the funding agency for schools, if required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the schools that we are discussing are LEA-maintained schools that have been taken over by the education association; they do not fall into the remit of the funding authorities or the purview of the bodies that can receive special purposes grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised—I have checked for the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright)—that additional funds, as and if they are appropriate, will flow through the funding agency for schools for such a purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the point? Is he saying that the funding agency for schools will have a role in providing money for local authority schools besides the role that he has so far defined, which is the provision of money for grant-maintained schools? I understand that the Minister's idea is that schools for which an education association is thought appropriate will have to go to the GM sector. But I wonder whether we are to have another money resolution before the House, and yet more new clauses. What are the mechanisms by which the funding agency determines the amount of money for the school? The Minister should introduce some logic into this argument; his remarks this morning have done nothing but add to the chaos and confusion that already exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, the hon. Lady is guilty of an error in logic herself. If an education association has been established for a school, ipso facto that school ceases to be maintained by the LEA. As I told the Committee a moment ago, during the period of the education association's administration—if I may put it that way—the school, through the association, may have recourse to the funding agency for schools on the same basis as the one that I outlined in reference to an earlier clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister now saying that the minute a school is defined as a failing school and falls into this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1248</span>
category, it will become a GM school for the purposes of funding? Incidentally, that raises an interesting point. If the transfer takes place during the school year, the local authority will already have funded that school for the whole year. The Gloucestershire example showed that local authorities cannot get their money back once those funds have been allocated. This is the first time the Minister has told us that a school will be designated a grant-maintained school ipso facto. That is a new departure and I am not sure whether it is covered by the money resolution that has been passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can assist the Committee. The hon. Lady has invented an interesting new legal concept. She described the school as a grant-maintained school designated for the purposes of funding. That is peculiar. I am not aware of a designated grant-maintained school, let alone one that is designated for the purpose of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school may have passed from the LEA's control in such circumstances as were dealt with in earlier clauses on which we had little debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school may have prepared an action plan and the Secretary of State may feel it appropriate to intervene in the interests of the school if, through the creation of an education association, it ceases to be an LEA-maintained school. The hon. Member for Bath suggested that special purpose funds may be required or the plan may be carried out within the existing budget. The Secretary of State will determine the criteria according to which the funding agency for schools will allocate funds to schools that are either grant-maintained or under an education association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear to the hon. Lady that there is a legal and factual distinction between these two types of schools. Schools under an education association are not grant-maintained schools, whether for the purposes of funding or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear about how the funding of those schools will work. What about the staff? Will they be paid by the LEA or will there be some sleight of hand allowing them to to be paid through the education association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the education association will become the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with my point about the Gloucester situation? Although schools had become grant-maintained in April, during the school year, and the local authority had funded them for the whole school year, it could not get that term's money back. How would that affect education associations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been established that a grant-maintained school can transfer at any time. An education association will also be able to transfer at any time, but it will depend on the circumstances. The existing school budget will be the initial source of funding before we consider a special purpose grant. It is not a new situation; the arrangements for grant-maintained schools are a precedent. An education association could be introduced at any stage in the school year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but will the money paid to that school by the LEA for the whole school year be refunded to the local authority, which will no longer be responsible and accountable for the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that the annual maintenance grant will be adjusted appropriately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, will the Minister table an amendment to ensure that the annual maintenance grant will be adjusted to deal with cases where grant-maintained schools have transferred in April and the LEA has paid the whole year's money to that school in advance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unwise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A request for clarification from the Minister has led to our discussion straying from the amendment. We should return to the strict terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just say so, Mr. Martin, it would be unwise for me to comment on a specific case. However, if, on reflection, further amendments were deemed appropriate to secure the objective that I outlined to the Committee, I would present them to the Committee. At first sight, it is not necessary to take further action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interventions have been more informative and useful than the debate on the amendment. The amendment deals with the sort of person who may become a member of the education association. I am pleased that the Minister has some ideas about the sort of people who may accept that responsibility. We are confused about what they will do. The Minister claimed that they would not manage the school. What does the reference to a school being "conducted by" an education association mean? What does "to conduct" mean, if not "to manage"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the hon. Gentleman—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a great deal of background noise. It is difficult for me to hear everything that is said, because of the size of the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by using an analogy. It is not always wise to use legal terms in a lay manner. However, most orchestras have a conductor, who sets out a piece of music, and a leader, who takes it forward. The task of the EA is not to manage the school, but to ensure that it is properly managed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that clarification. I am not an expert on orchestras, but I understand that the role of the conductor is significantly greater than the Minister has suggested. Without a conductor, the orchestra cannot achieve anything. I am sure that the Minister will reflect on his non-legalistic analogy and explain "conduct" more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not prolong proceedings. The clause states that the Secretary of State may appoint whoever he chooses to serve on an education association. Clause 195 states that the education association may do anything required by the Secretary of State. The Bill bestows an inordinate amount of power on the Secretary of State. I am sure that many hon. Members will have read 	<i>Hansard</i> of 15 December 1992. An hon. Member asked the Secretary of State to make a statement.
	<br><q><p>"on the extent of increase in the powers which can be exercised by the holder of his office since 1979".</p></q>
The 	<i>Official Report</i> records the Minister's answer thus:
	<br><q><p>"The Government's policy on education is not to increase the powers of my right hon. Friend. It is to devolve the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1250</span>
maximum possible power to the individual institutions with responsibility for providing education: schools, colleges of further education and universities.</p></q>
The contents of the Education Bill now in Standing Committee reflect this aim, as the most appropriate way to secure higher standards of education."—	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 December 1992; Vol. 216, c. 	<i>188.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wide powers that clauses 194 and 195 give the Secretary of State certainly do not bear out that answer.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have moved through the Bill, we have considered the funding agencies, which are unaccountable, the procedure—refused by the Government—by which parents could ballot to opt back in, which is unacceptable, and the parallel responsibilities of the funding agencies and the LEAs, which are unworkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education associations are not only unaccountable, unacceptable and unworkable, they are unbelievable. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the term education association had been "dreamt up" by his Department, and the Minister has shown every sign that he is sleepwalking through this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would extend the power of the education associations at least to enable them to set up committees of people with knowledge and experience of the school in question. The list given to us earlier by the Minister did not give me the confidence to believe that the education associations could carry out the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments recognise that governing bodies already contain people elected by a democratic ballot: the teacher and parent representatives. Those people should have rights, recognised in law, to be on committees of education associations. It is important that we get this part of the Bill right. As the Minister said, the education associations will have awesome powers. The Secretary of State told the Select Committee that they had the right to dismiss members of staff. They have the right to conduct almost any business in a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the term "conduct" the Minister used the analogy of a conductor conducting an orchestra. When I have been to the Festival Hall, I have watched the conductor, who seems to trigger every movement and sound from the orchestra. Before a public performance, he can stop the orchestra at any time and talk to the players about fine points of interpretation of the music. Is that what the education associations will be doing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Evennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erith and Crayford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a virtuoso performance!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, the hon. Gentleman is a virtuoso and he is certainly blowing his own trumpet. Clearly, the conductor has an important role, and I did not seek to belittle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that practitioners and instrumentalists would say that the conductor may wish certain things to happen, but whether they do, as they usually would in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1252</span>
best-regulated orchestras, depends on what happens in the orchestra on the night. Similarly, those teaching in a school are central. From what the hon. Gentleman said earlier, I believe that he would agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To stave off further criticism and to avoid creating a sour note, I might point out that the sort of conductor that the Minister had in mind was the type that one would find on the Clapham omnibus who rings the bell to start and stop the bus and who collects the fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education associations have awesome powers. Will the Minister clarify the state of limbo that exists in a school when an education association is conducting its affairs? Interestingly, the Minister told us that it will no longer be an LEA school, but that neither will it be a grant-maintained school. So it must be a new form of school that has been created on the hoof by the Minister during the debate. I look forward to the Minister clarifying the state of grace such schools will be in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may well be further debate, possibly on clause stand part, about the nature of the education associations and of the schools. I fail to understand—I hope that the hon. Gentleman can answer this—how the amendment, which will set up a clumsy and circumscribed committee, will clarify the issues that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman been patient and allowed me to develop my arguments, he would have heard me clarify the matter. We need involved in the work of the education associations people who know and understand the workings of a school. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson), who required more information from me, did not listen as I spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want schools to work well; we do not want them to fail. We want high standards, good discipline and a sense of purpose in our schools. We believe that that is best achieved by good management, good resources and people who understand and know the work of schools. Sometimes schools possess an intangible asset—the atmosphere created by the people in the school and those who work in it, and the professionalism that they display.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way with his customary courtesy. I understand why he referred earlier to conductors. Some conductors are flamboyant, others are eccentric, but all are egotists. I shall not pursue that point much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the "awesome powers" that will be held by the bodies taking over schools that have failed. I suspect that he would agree that, with the best will in the world, some schools will fail. If he is not happy with the proposals in the clause, what would he put in their place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were I to answer that in full, it would take another morning's sitting. However, I shall try to answer it in a phrase. Local education authorities now have procedures to carry out the action. The best way to deal with failing schools is for LEAs to appoint teams of inspectors who can do the work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that has happened for years and, sad to say, LEAs have not discharged their duties. The reason why we are introducing education associations is to rescue failing schools. By doing that, we rescue the pupils who attend the schools. That is the engine that drives the clause forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Gentleman referred to limbo, which I should like him to explain. Is not limbo the place where the souls of the just who died before Christ are detained? If I am correct, what relationship does that have to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman much about limbo, but I know a bit about purgatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for your advice, Mr. Martin. I shall not be drawn by the hon. Gentleman's bogus point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the education association will take over all aspects of the school. The White Paper, allegedly written by the Secretary of State, states that strong leadership and effective management in schools is required. I do not disagree, but people who understand the particular school are needed. People from outside who do not know the school or the area should not be brought in to run that school. Members of the Committee with experience of working in schools know that that does not work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is becoming clear, but will the hon. Gentleman respond to one point about schools failing? In my opinion, and in that of many others involved in education, the most important factors in a school are the quality and leadership of the head teacher, the quality and advice of the governors and the quality and classroom work of the teachers. If some of those characters are moved and recreated as a committee, that would work against the purpose of the education association, which is to provide a new start for the school. The amendment is nonsensical and would continue the problem that it is intended to solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many reasons why a school may fail. In a letter to parents, a school in Enfield suggests that the pastoral care system may not operate, the recording and reporting to parents may not work, class sizes of between 33 and 38 may be too large, there may be no lunchtime supervision and there may be a reduction in special needs provision and part-time schooling. All those factors could show a school to be failing. The school and the parents maintain that that is due to the cuts by the Tory council in the borough of Enfield. The body should include people who know and understand the needs of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the sort of task that the education association will undertake. The Secretary of State's little list of about 100 schools contains probably some of the most difficult schools to work in and to manage. They are the sort of schools that already have problems attracting and retaining staff, that may have suffered from reduced
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1254</span>
funding—as did the Enfield school—or that do not have much parental funding because of the area in which they are situated. They may, for one reason or another, have depressed parental involvement, but it usually happens that such schools have poorer and less welcoming surroundings.

No one will find taking on such a task an attractive proposition. In fact, I believe that it would be especially unattractive. The Minister has hinted that the work will be largely voluntary—people will not receive a fee or a salary for doing it. I am trying to imagine what type of people will be members of the education associations and how those associations will work if they lack the people described in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman assume that the people serving on the educational associations will not be remunerated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am guided by the Minister's comments. He said that only certain fees would be available. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present when the Minister said that. If not, he should catch up with the Minister's comments later. The Minister made it clear that there would be no salaries and that only limited fees would be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should clarify that point for the benefit of the Committee. I did not say that no salaries would be paid. The record will show that what I sought to say was that it would not normally be the case that it would be anticipated that one would pay salaries. All this is in a form where it would be a matter of horses for courses. I do not think, if it is a matter of an education association dealing with the problems of a particular school, or a small number of schools, that it would be necessary to pay salaries. Clearly, if the need were there, it could be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite revealing. I hope that the Minister will expand on the point. In a previous debate on an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath, we were led to believe that no salaries would be paid. Now, it appears that the education association will be a salaried body, providing jobs for the boys. Money will be taken from the school budget and put into yet another mini-quango, which will run the schools in a particular locality. Will it be good news for the parents in Enfield to know that, if they fail through lack of resources, even more resources will be taken away to set up an education association and pay its salaries and fees? I am sure that it will not; it will be very bad news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will be the members of the education associations? The comments of the Secretary of State are instructive. The 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 29 July reported that the Secretary of State considers that
	<br><q><p>"education associations will be composed of retired teachers and people 'good at running things'."</p></q>
An elderly aunt of mine was very good at running a little whelk stall on the sea front at Scarborough. I doubt that the Secretary of State, or even the Minister, would consider her an appropriate member of an education association, given that she left school at the age of 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the level to which we have stooped. We shall be scraping around looking for people—we still do not know whether they will be paid a salary—to sit on the education associations and run our schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. The intention of the Bill is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1255</span>
clear. People with experience in education and those with management expertise will be invited to serve on the education associations so that they can improve the quality and standards of a school that is failing its pupils. The hon. Gentleman does himself and his party a disservice by denigrating this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to go along with this part of the Bill if I thought that it had any hope of working. It is a most pathetic attempt to rescue failed schools, as Conservative Members have called them, and it is doomed to failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman does not appreciate the time and commitment needed by these people to go into the school, especially if they have dismissed the senior staff and if they are not remunerated—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your intervention, Mr. Martin. It is difficult to talk, and it must be difficult for you to hear, with the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth continually barracking. If the hon. Gentleman has something to say, I hope that he will speak later in the debate instead of barracking other hon. Members who are making valid points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that, like me, my hon. Friend has seen local authority advisory services go in to rescue failing schools and do so successfully, with great patience and commitment. That has been because they know the school and the area, and how to marry it up with neighbouring schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill's proposals this very service, which has been so useful, will be emasculated—if it is not annihilated altogether—merely so that the Conservative party can give, not jobs for the boys but, as we now discover, jobs for grandads and grandmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's observations. His essential point was that a school falling into this category could be rescued only by a professional team of people who know what they are doing, coming into a school to carry out the kind of work that local education authorities have been doing for years. Their capacity to do so has been reduced by the cuts that local education authorities have suffered in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued by the Secretary of State's comments that the education associations will be composed of retired teachers. I was also interested to hear the Minister say that members would be teachers and people in the community and locality. If they are retired teachers, one assumes that, in many cases, they have worked in the area for nearly 30 to 40 years. Would they be willing to go into local school—where, perhaps, there are former colleagues—with the power to dismiss people whom they have known for many years in that or in other schools in their own community? If the Minister thinks that teachers anywhere are prepared to do that, he is labouring under an illusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if people from outside the area were drafted in they would not have the historical and geographical knowledge of the area to enable them to cope with the problems. That is why our amendment is so important. The idea of drafting in people who are both good at running things and retired is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who go into a school that is failing—bearing in mind all the difficulties involved—would need to be the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1256</span>
freshest, brightest, youngest and most alert people. Those are the kind of people who can take over and rescue a school in such circumstances—not the quasi-Dad's Army that the Secretary of State has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the start of the hon. Gentleman's speech, I have been trying to ascertain whether the amendment would really help matters. I am still not convinced that it does, even though I suspect that we shall have a more interesting debate on the clause as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the hon. Gentleman explain what he has just said? He claims that he would prefer—in a school that is in difficulties or failing, or in any school—to bring in local people. Yet it is often the convention when new head teachers and heads of department are appointed to employ people from other parts of the country to provide an admixture of experience. The hon. Gentleman's point does his argument a disservice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The existing system of HMI reports and the power of LEA advisers and inspectors is the proper way to deal with schools that are in difficulty. The HMIs are ultimately responsible and they report to the Secretary of State. The local inspectorate is responsible to the local community through the LEA. That is a proper chain of accountability. To whom are the education associations accountable? I shall enlighten the Committee. During the proceedings of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts on 28 October 1992, I asked the Secretary of State:
	<br><q><p>"To whom are the Education Associations accountable"?</p></q>
The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><q><p>"To me and I am accountable to Parliament."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not relevant to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman has spent a great deal of time attacking education associations. However, the amendments accept the associations and propose that they work through school committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport has tried to demolish the amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Bath by claiming that heads and deputies should not be included on the education associations. However, nothing in the Bill prevents the education associations from encouraging school committees. They could set up a committee along the lines that the hon. Gentleman proposed, but why should they be required to do that? The failure of a school may be at the door of some of the people that the hon. Gentleman wishes to include statutorily on the school committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that people who understand the school should form the committees. They should at least be able to advise the education associations. The LEA's capacity to assist in those matters has been reduced almost to the point of non-existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the intervention of the hon. Member for Battersea was especially important? The hon. Member for Battersea rightly claims that schedule 10(5) includes the power to establish committees. In an earlier response, the Minister said that an education association could probably deal with only one particular school because of the need for specialists to tackle problems. A committee established by an education association will probably deal with one school. To some extent, therefore, the Bill covers the point
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1257</span>
made in the amendment. It is important to make that clear. If the report deems that the governors have failed, it is sensible to appoint prospective governors who can prepare for the future and gain experience that will help them if the school is allowed to continue. It is sensible to take the Bill's intention further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I point out to the hon. Member for Battersea that existing governing bodies include head teachers and other members of staff. The Bill should provide for the school committees to reflect that. If the education association takes the action that it feels is necessary, the people involved will, as with any governing body, cease to be on the governing body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Bath—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] The clean and hon. Member for Bath is correct up to a point. He is renowned for his prose, and he is now putatating—whatever that is. He is right in that we are trying to ensure that, at the end of the process, there is a smooth transition to a new governing body. My problem is that the amendments are too specific. If the hon. Gentleman examines them, he will see why that is so. Amendment No. 792 is very specific about who "shall" be on the committees. If it were an enabling amendment, we would not have the same difficulty. As the hon. Gentleman said, the matter is already dealt with in schdeule 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Battersea was intervening on the previous intervention by the hon. Member for Bath, but he has left me to answer his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment draws in the very people who we feel should be involved in the work of the education associations. We have had the general statement that the Secretary of State will appoint five people, but no further definition has been given as to who will serve on the education associations or advise them. That is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this has been a useful debate. I look forward to the Minister's response. Opposition Members feel that the clause is unworkable and that it will not achieve what it sets out to do—to help and rescue schools that are having problems. It is a device used by the Government so that on the say-so of the report of one member of the inspectorate, an education association can be brought in and can put the school into what I have described as a state of limbo. I hope that the Minister will clarify the state that the school will be in at that point. The school will be in limbo with only one alternative—it will have to go grant maintained, without recourse to a parental ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about the wording of the amendment and its thrust, especially in the light of the remarks of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson). The hon. Gentleman has tried to misrepresent the role of the education associations, and he has not stated clearly enough how and under what circumstances an education association would be installed within a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the years I have been a member of an education authority I have seen that the authority knows which schools in its area are in difficulties and that it has failed to take the right action to prevent the schools failing and to help them move forward. It serves no purpose to pretend any differently. The hon. Member for Devonport should have asked why education authorities are not taking action now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1258</span>
Like the hon. Member for Devonport, I am a member of the Select Committee on Education, and when Professor Sutherland appeared before the Committee, he made it clear that education authorities knew full well which schools were in difficulties. The education association should take action when the authority has failed. That is the last resort for a school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady starkly makes the point that LEAs often know when a school is failing. She added that such LEAs often fail to take the necessary action. Will she agree that one of the main reasons why LEAs are sometimes unable to take the necessary remedial action is that they do not have the available financial resources? Is it not ironic that the Minister said today that educational associations will be able to get special educational grants, if they find a need for additional resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The difficulty invariably involves a management breakdown in the school. The education authority has failed to grasp what I accept is a difficult problem, dealing with senior staff in a school who are not properly managing, leading or guiding the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some misunderstanding about the role of the LEAs, which I shall endeavour to clear up. Does the hon. Lady agree that it is important that the LEA intervene long before the school becomes an at-risk school? The purpose of intervention is to prevent long-term damage that may be done to the school and to the children being educated in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that point. If an educational association has to come into a school, that shows the failure of the education authority to deal with the problem. The message that the Committee should give out—and, I am sorry to say, the hon. Member for Devonport totally failed to give it—is that education authorities have the responsibility to ensure that schools are giving good education in their areas and that they do not get to the stage where the schools get bad reports, are going downhill or are deemed to be failing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State was asked about the number of failing schools, he told us that the number on his little list was over 100. I calculate that to be about a half of one per cent. If that is the case—serious though it is to the children in those schools—LEAs have clearly done a good job in preventing 99·5 per cent. of schools from failing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One school that fails is one too many, because a problem in that school is a problem that its pupils are experiencing. Pupils have one chance in their academic lives; if we do not ensure that that academic chance is of the best, we are failing those children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport said that it was good that so many schools do not fall into this category. I am delighted that they do not, but there must be a continuing thrust across the education system to improve standards. Surely we are looking not for a system of mediocrity but for a system of excellence. Judging by the hon. Gentleman's remarks, it is mediocrity that he has held up as the great god, not excellence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady seriously suggesting that, after 14 years of Conservative rule, our schools are in such a mediocre and appalling state that they have to be gutted

in this way? Schools have shown themselves to be infinitely more successful than manufacturing industry during the Government's period of office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An education authority has failed if it has let any of its schools get into such a position that it receives a bad inspection report and an education association has to be established. The Opposition's proposal is to continue with the existing system of irregular inspection. They want LEAs to be told quietly to put right the problems. That will not enable some schools in some areas to get out of the difficulties that they are in and will not help the children with the difficulties that they are having with their education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw her comments associating my name with mediocrity. I recall a debate last week on the needs of gifted children. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment by referring to amendments that have already been debated. It would be helpful if we could debate this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) get up first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would help if I clarified what I said about the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport. I said that his comments were mediocre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept that if an education association is established, rather than leaving the LEA to raise the school's low standard, the label of a failing school will be attached to that school and, by implication, to the teachers and pupils? That will damage the morale of teachers, managers and students. Once that label has been attached to a school it could be years or decades before it manages to rid itself of that reputation among the local community, even if standards have risen. That is an inherent weakness in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for that reason that education authorities should take action now. They know which schools in their area are causing difficulties and are not providing the education that children deserve. They should take action straight away rather than wait until an education association has to be established. If a school gets a damning report it should not be left alone; we should do something about it. We have a responsibility to ensure that schools that are not giving children a proper education are better managed and that conflicts between staffs are solved. It is manifest to anyone who has been a member of an education authority or a teacher—as many Opposition Members have—that some schools are not run properly and are not providing the right schooling for children. I am sure that they will join me in deploring the fact that those problems are not being resolved by LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the hon. Lady two questions. First, is she aware that it is immensely difficult to get rid of heads who are blocking the solution to problems in schools? Secondly, can she name the authorities that are not rescuing schools? They are quite wrong if they do not rescue schools, but it is my experience that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1260</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment deals with the establishment of a school committee and has nothing to do with the sacking or retention of heads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I am aware that I have strayed wide of the amendment and I shall conclude my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the amendment, which would require an education association to set up a complex plethora of committees, we shall not tackle the real issue of resolving as quickly as possible the problems in a school that result in the provision of inadequate education. The statutory responsibility of the education association must focus on the education of the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. Before responding to the long speech of the hon. Member for Devonport, I shall touch on the contributions of my hon. Friends who answered his arguments well. My hon. Friend the Member for Erewash has just set out her anxiety about the problems of failing schools. My hon. Friends the Members for Battersea and for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) explained the lack of flexibility in the amendments. The hon. Member for Hemsworth referred to heads who block change and improvement. That is one possible scenario for failing schools, though by no means the only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport spoke with his customary force and a degree of clarity. Remembering our earlier discussion on limbo—which you called to order, Mr. Martin—I recall the reply of the old man who, when asked what old age was like, said that on the whole it was rather better than the alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister pursues the misinformation given to him by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, will he recognise that limbo is an ancient concept that no longer pertains in theological terms? As he knows, he can refer to Virgil:
	<br><q><p>"Tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was, as ever, a most helpful intervention. It enables me to repair a gross omission because I did not mention the distinguished, short contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not called limbo, this is almost the end of the road for failing schools. It is not the beginning of the process in which we are suddenly imposing an alternative regime of governance or leadership for those schools. The process begins when, through its monitoring and inspection of schools under maintenance, a local authority considers the quality of the school. It may then go through the registered inspector's quadrennial report, which must be considered by the chief inspector if the school is deemed to be failing. Only in those circumstances should we even get to the stage of preparing an action plan—in which the LEA would be involved—let alone the imposition of an education association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, such a position would arise in exceptional, very difficult and minority circumstances. As I suggested earlier, the alternative would be failure. We are trying to rescue the schools in the interests of the schools themselves and of the children. For that reason, despite the blandishments of the hon. Member for Devonport, I advise the Committee to resist the amendment and the hon. Gentleman's argument. In considering the chain of events that I described, it would take a conspiracy theory,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1261</span>
or paranoia, to exaggerated lengths to suggest that one inspection would be connived at or contrived by the Secretary of State to produce this result—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the position on inspections? The Secretary of State said that inspections of potentially failing schools should be based on league tables. That is not the view of Ofsted. What side does the Minister take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows, there is a provision for regular inspections, which may throw up problems of that sort. It is not a matter of inspection, but of the agreement of the chief inspector—he has been widely praised in the committee and is universally respected—to decide that the report about a failing school is appropriate and that an action plan is required. There is no question of collusion in the interests of promoting a grant-maintained school. This is a last, not a first recourse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport referred to his aunt in Scarborough who kept a whelk stall. One of my hon. Friends asked why she was not a member. I have no idea of the lady's politics and I would not wish to comment, but I responded by saying that if she could run a whelk stall properly she was rather over qualified for that position. Eloquently though the hon. Gentleman put his case, he could not decide where he was. At one point, for example, he said, "Well, of course, we need people who are close to the school and members of the local community to run the association." At another point, he said, "Well, of course, if they were that close, they might not want to do it because they would be too close to the other teachers."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows some of the problems that arise when such cosy situations have been connived at for a long time. They are cosy for those in place, but not so cosy for the parents. At different times in his blatant interventions in my speech, when I needed to correct the record, the hon. Gentleman implied that I said that salaries would be generally payable or that they would never be payable, when in fact I said neither.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said both that he was in favour of rescuing failed schools by drastic action and that he was against the means that the Government had taken, although such means would already have been through the LEA screen. I conclude from the amendments that the hon. Gentleman is entirely in favour of drastic action as and when appropriate, but that he wants to fetter the action so that it could not possibly work. The amendments would not be helpful to the work of an education association, they would attempt to resolve a virtually desperate position in a school that was already close to failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, it would be open to an education association, which would select appropriate people with the competence to cope with particular problems either in the school or the group of schools for which it has some responsibility, to set up committees and to bring in outside experts. The amendments would formalise that process and establish a schools committee and other tests that would fetter the ability to take action on behalf of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I slightly implied to the hon. Member for Hemsworth, sometimes—not always—the heads or other staff members may be part of the problem. I suggest that it is much more likely to be a problem of leadership and management—to use the phrase from the White Paper which the hon. Member for Devonport quoted—than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1262</span>
simply a matter of resources. Although I do not know the school that he mentioned, it would be interesting to know if there was a recent inspectors' report on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that it is a good idea to fetter the discretion and the ability of the education association to take executive action if that stage is reached. The association may take advice from those who have local knowledge. It may include people who have direct knowledge of the local circumstances. To use a phrase that may be familiar elsewhere, nobody is ruled out and nobody is ruled in either.

We fear that the amendments would inevitably create barriers to flexibility. To take a specific example, they might well have the effect of seeking to preserve the governing body or the staff who had been the cause of a school's failure. We do not lightly seek to impose education associations. The course of action set out in the Bill provides a number of stages and safeguards, of which that is the last resort. However, if they are required they must be able to do the job effectively. I invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want better management in our schools and effective action to be taken to help schools with difficulties. Nothing that I have heard from the Minister suggests that that will be so with education associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may briefly defend my aunt in Scarborough whom, it was suggested, might not be appropriate for an education association. An article in the 	<i>Times Educational Supplement</i> on 22 January referred to the Secretary of State's visit to a school in his constituency. It said:
	<br><q><p>"Visiting one classroom, he asked how old the children were. When he was told that they were in Year 11, Mr. Patten said that it was surprising the school used an 'American System' to count the school years. 'He was absolutely gobsmacked when I told him that it was because of his Government's national curriculum that we counted them in that way' said drama teacher Andrea Phillips."</p></q>
The Secretary of State does not even know the intricacies of the education system. We simply suggest that those who are appointed to education associations should have some knowledge of schools and education. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
