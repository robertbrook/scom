<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 588, in page 50, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) No proposals shall be published under this section for the purpose of making a change in the character of the school of the kind mentioned in section 92(1) of this Act within three years of the date of incorporation of the governing body of the school under this Part of this Act unless—
<ol>
<li>the local education authority for that area, and</li>
<li>the funding authority</li></ol>
have given their consent in writing to the change in question.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 589, in page 50, line 19, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) The publication of a proposal under this section which would change the admission arrangements of the school shall require the consent of the local education authority, unless the authority is subject to an order under (7)(1)(b).'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Before I call on the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg), may I mention for the information of hon. Members that on my provisional selection of amendments, Government amendment No. 602 appears in the wrong place? It should appear as the second group of amendments under clause 114.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always seem to draw the short straw. [HON. MEMBERS: "AW!"] It is difficult to start a speech before lunch and to have to start again in the middle in the afternoon, but I have so much experience of doing that now that it seems to come naturally to me.<br><br>
Before we adjourned for lunch I was speaking about the change of character of a grant-maintained school. I said that to change the character in any way suggests changing either the age range of the school or the type of education that the school will deliver. Both kinds of change are likely to involve selection. I was about to give an example of two secondary schools in Penrith which, for the information of the <i>Hansard</i> writers, is in Cumbria. [HON. MEMBERS: <i>"Hansard</i> are not listening."] I think they are listening now.<br><br>
One of the schools is a local education authority-maintained school for 11 to 16-year-olds. The other is a grant-maintained school for 13 to 18-year-olds. Applications have been submitted by both schools for 11 to 18 provision. There has been considerable delay on the part of the Secretary of State in reaching a decision.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1000</span>
Setting aside the nonsensical decision to allow a grant-maintained school to be set up when rationalisation was needed, there is a suspicion that the grant-maintained school proposes not only to change its age range, but to introduce selection at 11. That would turn the clock back many years—back to the 1950s, as the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: He agrees with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and he will vote for the amendment. He made an excellent speech in support of our amendment.<br><br>
The Government intend to introduce selection by the back door, without adequate consultation. Selection was discredited many years ago. Moves towards true comprehensive education have been successful. The roots of comprehensive education lie in many Tory-controlled local education authorities—for example, Leicestershire, which was keen to become comprehensive, and the West Riding.<br><br>
The problems of a lack of resources and a coherent funding policy that face education today cannot be brushed under the carpet by moves such as selection in grant-maintained schools. Change of character can only mean selection. We must ram that home time and again. Introducing selection in such a way under clause 85 is devious. That does not surprise me, however, because the whole Bill is devious. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] I am only expressing the view of educationalists. They have assured me and my hon. Friends that they consider it devious.<br><br>
The Bill is not truthful. Its real aims are to get rid of local education authorities and introduce selection. The Government have not had the guts to come out and say that, because they know that it will be unpopular. They have simply sneaked the provision into the Bill through the back door.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being a little unfair to the Government. Did not the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) come right out front this morning and clearly state that? I congratulate him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. If the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth had received the promotion that he deserves and was sitting on the Front Bench, where he should be, the provision would be clear because he would not have drafted the Bill in such a way. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman keeps his lowly position, like me, as chairman of a Back-Bench Committee.<br><br>
It has always been the Government's policy to reintroduce selection for entry into secondary education. But it has always been difficult for them to bring about such a change. The Bill has provided them with a way in which to do it. They want to achieve grammar school selection by encouraging grant-maintained schools significantly to change their admissions policy.<br><br>
The concept of selection highlights failure. It is educationally unsound and it damages children who are deemed to be failures under the system. Selection, whether at 11 years old, 12 years old or 13 years old, and putting children into different groups, show how little the Government know about the development of children. Once the majority of children are told that they are failures, under-achievement and a waste of talent follow. Although many children who failed the 11-plus system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0660">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
back in the 1950s proved that the system was wrong, I admit that there were those who achieved considerable success.<br><br>
Most children, however, who went to secondary modern schools accepted the establishment's judgment of them. They regarded themselves as failures and low achievers; they left school and went into humdrum jobs. Many realised later that they had been failed by the education system, and went back to further and higher education and obtained the necessary qualifications that the system had originally failed to let them achieve.<br><br>
I can remember primary schools where they taught to the tests and crammed pupils to pass the 11-plus. Despite what the hon. Member for Norwich, North said, the Government want to return to those days. If a child wishes to get a place in a grant-maintained school that uses selection, the primary schools will be forced to teach to the test, so the children can pass the exam and gain a place.<br><br>
Not only here, but during the Committee stages of the Education Reform Act 1988 and the Education (Schools) Act 1992, Ministers continually accused Opposition Members of being dinosaurs. The only dinosaurs are hon. Members who advocate a return to the days of selection, the 11-plus, and failure for our children. The vast majority of educationists and parents view the return to that era with horror and disbelief. They cannot believe that the Government would consider going back to the days of selection. When corresponding with parents about educational problems we have to tell them of the Bill's proposals, and they are horrified. That is why the Government did not opt for the abolition of local education authorities, and for bringing back selection by the front door. They knew that they would not get away with it because it would cause so much outrage.<br><br>
The idea that such a system of selection improves choice for parents is absurd. The Government have spewed out for the past five years the boast that parents have a choice for their children, when they—the Government—know that selection is the last way to give parents choice. It certainly gives choice, but not to parents. It gives choice to the grant-maintained schools. If the clause is unamended, parents will not choose the schools; the schools with a selection procedure will choose the pupils. That is a cynical con by the Government.<br><br>
The Education Reform Act 1988 began the threat to comprehensive education. Hon. Members who debated that legislation said then that it was the beginning of the demise of comprehensive education. The 1988 Act has brought about competition between schools, with incentives for them to control the nature of their pupil intake. When that Act was introduced, we were told that no significant changes would be made to a school's character. The then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) pledged—it may have been written into the legislation—that the character of a school could not change for five years after acquiring grant-maintained status.<br><br>
What happened next? The right hon. Member for Mole Valley left the Department of Education and Science and, shortly afterwards, the Act was changed and grant-maintained schools were allowed to change their character almost immediately. This morning, the Minister seemed to guarantee that that was the last change of policy.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
However, having seen the Government's performance in education during the past five years, we know that we cannot trust the words of Ministers. One can expect a U-turn, a change of policy, at any time. The view expressed by the right hon. Member for Mole Valley was soon forgotten because selection had always been at the forefront of the Government's mind.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
As I said this morning, research carried out by Leicester university showed that 30 per cent. of the first batch of grant-maintained schools used subjective admission criteria such as pupil interviews, tests and reports from previous schools. That resulted in those schools having a selective intake, but we had been told that selection was not part of the programme.<br><br>
Clause 85 goes even further and encourages future grant-maintained schools to become grammar schools. I repeat that parents will find that their children will be turned away from grant-maintained, specialist and selective schools. The Government have regularly disagreed with the Opposition about that issue, but one has only to look at what is happening in the rest of the country. In Bromley in 1992, children were turned away from schools which had become selective. Recently, we learnt that there are proposals in Wandsworth to introduce grant-maintained, selective schools—grammar schools—in the hope that the majority of children will enter them. The local education authority will continue to have two schools for children who do not get into the grant-maintained sector. In other words, two sink schools are being provided for children who do not pass the exam or other tests that are proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. He said that a local education authority is proposing some grant-maintained, selective schools. A local education authority does not have power to propose grant-maintained schools. As he should know, that is a matter for the schools themselves. It is true that, in the concept of magnet schools, there was an element of aptitude assessment and selection, but that is very different from the selection that he was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if my English has not been as perfect as that employed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright). I shall withdraw the word "propose" and substitute "encourage".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if Wandsworth is encouraging parents to send pupils to those schools, it is going against the grain of the Government's policy that LEAs should not influence, in any way, parents' choice of schools for their childrens' education? Is Wandsworth behaving in a way that the Government abhor?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I am sure that she is not naive. We all know that Wandsworth, along with many other Tory-controlled authorities, is encouraging its schools to opt out as quickly as possible. Whether selection is determined by an aptitude test or whatever else the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) wants to call it, it will take place and kids in Wandsworth who fail the test will end up in its two sink schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will come as a surprise to the schools which thought that the council was opposing them when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0661">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1003</span>
applied for grant-maintained status. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, Wandsworth council has made its position clear. If parents and the community want schools to apply for grant-maintained status, that council will wish them well.<br><br>
The situation is no different from one to which we referred in previous sittings. A council made it known that it was opposed to such a move. It was up to the governors of the schools to ensure that a truthful, honest and balanced view was put to parents before the ballot. There is nothing wrong with the Wandsworth solution. If the hon. Gentleman doubts that, he need only look at the improved results and performance of Wandsworth schools since the borough took over from the Inner London education authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It always amuses me that there is considered to be nothing wrong with a local education authority encouraging a school to opt out, but that there is something very wrong with an education authority encouraging a school not to opt out. That is a double standard. From my understanding of the situation, the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) understates the case. Local Conservative councillors are addressing parents at public meetings, telling them how good it is for Wandsworth schools to opt out. I hope that the Minister will write to Wandsworth council saying that he abhors that and that it should not be encouraging schools to opt out—just as other authorities should not encourage schools to remain under local education authority control—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is a while since the hon. Gentleman mentioned the amendment. Also, we cannot debate opting out now. The amendment is substantially narrower than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respect your decision, Sir John. I was dragged down that road and responded unwillingly to the hon. Member for Battersea, who raised the matter. I was using Wandsworth as an example of a local authority that encourages grant-maintained schools to become selective. Unless the amendments are passed, clause 85 will allow Wandsworth to get away with that. I vigorously oppose any labelling of children as successes or failures, winners or losers at any age.<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, the Government want to introduce an elitist system and reduce choice and resources for the majority of pupils. This morning, I told the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) that in the 1960s, when we had selection at the age of 11 and secondary modern schools, 44 per cent. of those attending those schools left with no academic qualifications. By the late 1980s, only 12 per cent. of kids left school without academic qualifications, after the introduction of comprehensive education. That is not a coincidence. Comprehensive education has been a huge success and we should work to improve it, not to destroy it, as the Government are hell-bent on doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Congdon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that that is due in part—perhaps to a considerable extent—to the raising of the school-leaving age to 16? Prior to that, many youngsters did not have the opportunity to take O-level examinations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That must be the silliest intervention so far. Because those kids were not selected for grammar schools, they were destined to leave at 15. They had no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
option. They had already been deemed failures, so they left school at 15. There is no point in the hon. Gentleman shaking his head and saying that that is wrong—I am right. A few pupils, if they were lucky, might have gone to a secondary modern school that offered GCE examinations. Most kids who went to secondary modern schools left school at 15 because they had no other option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is dealing with my point. A significant change was the raising of the school-leaving age, which helped to raise expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The raising of the school-leaving age to 16 was a step forward, and I would like the school leaving age to be raised further. The children who failed the 11-plus were deemed failures and they had nothing to look forward to except leaving school and going into humdrum jobs. Only later could those people go into further and higher education and get qualifications. If the hon. Gentleman wants, after the Committee sitting, I shall roll off the names of dozens of friends of mine who were in that position.<br><br>
The dinosaurs in the Conservative party wish to return to the bad old days. They wish to return to the days of selection and of grouping children into successes and failures. When they have achieved that, it would not surprise me if they wished to go back further. I remember using chalk and slates at infant school. It would not surprise me, given the present lack of resources in our schools, if some Conservative Members wanted us to return to the chalk and slate era. When they talk about dinosaurs they should look at themselves and realise that, if the clause stands as it is presently worded, we will be on our way back to the 1950s and the bad old days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Opposition Members and some of my hon. Friends have expressed pleasure that I have caught your eye, Sir John. I am flattered. As far as my hon. Friends are concerned, that may be because we have heard so much saying so little from the hon. Members for Wallsend (Mr. Byers), for Hemsworth, for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) and for Bath (Mr. Foster).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I have not actually spoken in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Bath has not yet got his name in today's <i>Hansard,</i> I thought that I had better give him a name check.<br><br>
I shall make a modest but, I hope, significant contribution. Of course, my contribution will be brief. When Opposition Members use that phrase, it is a euphemism, or even a parliamentary convention along the lines of "it may be for the convenience of the Committee". As we know, such a contribution will be anything but for the convenience of the Committee.<br><br>
Much personal reminiscence was prayed in aid this morning. I know that you, Sir John, will quickly rule me out of order if I offer any anecdotes from my time as a supply teacher in the old Inner London education authority, as a head of department in a comprehensive school in Suffolk, or as a parent of four children: one has yet to reach school age; one is in a comprehensive local authority primary school; one is in a comprehensive local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0662">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1005</span>
authority middle school; and one is in a comprehensive local authority high school. I shall not offer anecdotes from that rich seam.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister pointed out to Opposition Members several times that we seek to offer choice. We know that there is often little or no choice in rural areas. I made that point on Second Reading. I wish that Opposition Members would consult that speech. We know that, in some urban areas, there is not much choice for people who do not travel far from their areas—just as there is no choice of shops, churches or pubs for them. Does that mean that, because there is no choice for some, there should be no choice for anybody? I do not believe so. I do not see what is wrong with selection for grammar schools if it suits the children, parents and governors in an area, although I would not pursue that as an ideal in my constituency. It may come about, as some people in Suffolk want it, just as others want to do away with our three-tier system and return to 5-to-ll and 11-to-16 schools and a sixth form centre. However, it must be right to debate such matters in our rapidly changing world. The amendments would tie people down and are therefore absolutely wrong.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
As yet, Suffolk has no grant-maintained schools, although one school is approaching the ballot stage. As I said on Second Reading, there is widespread support among almost all schools in the county for the local authority, which is excellent and Conservative-controlled. However, I hope that, just as future reforms will bring a rich diversity to local government, we shall have a rich diversity in grant-maintained and other schools as grant-maintained status becomes ever more attractive.<br><br>
Although I support the Suffolk local education authority, I do not support its ambition to be a unitary authority. Choice does not end when a school becomes self-governing. It must extend to the nature, size and ethos of a school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman consider the following proposition: if the governors of a grant-maintained school decide to introduce selection of pupils at the age of 11, what choice will be left to other schools in the same area that wish to remain comprehensive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be up to the schools in that area to discuss the matter, but the problem has not arisen yet and the question remains academic.<br><br>
For the three hours that the Committee has debated the amendment, Opposition Members have made heavy weather of the question of whether specialism means grammar schools by the back door. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) said, from a sedentary position, that it means grammar schools by the front door. He is entitled to that opinion, but there are many types of specialism—for example, in arts, sciences, technology or other disciplines. I agree with what the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) said this morning about rural schools, to which I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give some thought. Even in an area that is not especially sparsely populated, if one school specialises in technology and its nearest neighbour specialises in arts, children may have to travel an extra 10 miles to reach the school of their choice. Children in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
rural England already travel an average of seven miles daily. That extra travelling would constitute an additional burden and expense for parents, of whom so much is already demanded.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) said this morning that the difficulty with choosing children for specialist schools was that it could only be done on the basis of ability, especially if not much time had been devoted to a subject in primary school. The national curriculum will diminish discrepancies in that regard. It will ensure a broad basis of parallel experience, on which teachers and school can and will build. That process underpins the clause.<br><br>
The amendment would stifle any change for three years from the start of self-governing status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are the flabbiest arguments to have been paraded before the Committee so far. I should be grateful for a clarification from the hon. Gentleman. Let us suppose that a school makes some form of selection on the grounds of subject—say, science, sports or music. What happens if a child is not selected for that school and must go elsewhere? Surely, the parents have not been given a choice. The school has made the choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. I can visualise only what might happen in my constituency, with which I am familiar. If the children who make that choice are turned down, they will have to go to another school. When we say that everyone has a freedom of choice, we recognise that it cannot be guaranteed by the authority to respond positively to every parent's decision. That is not the position now nor will it be in future. We cannot give a guarantee to supply everyone on demand with everything that he or she wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the definition of choice. What the hon. Gentleman is saying has nothing to do with choice, because when we choose we get what we ask for. Under the Bill, we shall not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is possible for a person to make a choice, but there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Preference" is a better word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not argue with that. But the hon. Gentleman's amendment would reduce choice and preference even more than that which we have described so far. By accepting the amendments, we would be putting the dead hand of Big Brother on the Bill. Big Brother knows best!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given way to the hon. Gentleman often enough. We have heard enough from him in these proceedings. He, of all people, is the spokesman for Big Brother, and I do not want him to have a further say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's comments are not good news to the Minister. We have now ascertained that choice means choice for schools, not for parents. Opposition Members have always believed that, and now we know that at least one Conservative Member in the Committee recognises it, too. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can assist those in rural areas, such as places in Devon or in his constituency. Let us consider a school in Okehampton or Ivybridge—both places are a long way from the centres of population—that chose to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0663">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
become a magnet or specialist school. If children in the area were not admitted into the school on the basis that they did not meet its criteria, would the parents be forced to send their children 30 or 40 miles away to school because the local comprehensive was no longer available for them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman repeat his question? I was listening to what my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) was saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me so much time. A moment ago, he would not give way to me. He did not want me to say anything. He has received a little advice from the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight)—the hon. Lady has told him what his answer should be.<br><br>
My question may assist Conservative Members who represent rural areas. What happens in a town such as Okehampton or Ivybridge in Devon—both places are a long way from centres of population—if one of the area's schools changes and becomes a specialist school in science, mathematics or sport and does not admit some children? Would the parents not be able to exercise their choice to send their children to the local comprehensive school? Would they be forced to send them 30 or 40 miles away to school when the local authority was in the process of abandoning its transport funding policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the example cited by the hon. Gentleman, that would be correct. But it is not the position under the Bill. I apologise to him for not following his argument. I understand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will make a decision on the applications that go to him. He will have to bear such circumstances in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Secretary of State who has the final choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is the Secretary of State. The arguments advanced for the amendments fly in the face of the Bill and of Conservative education policy. Parents should be able to make a decision. We have argued about whether it should be a matter of choice or preference, but we are trying to give parents more choice in the decisions that they make. The amendment takes no account of changes to local government that will take place over the next few years or of changes in educational thinking and parental demands that will occur in any three-year period. It is a pity that the Opposition have wasted so many hours peddling their arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to take part in this important debate, not least because the clause and the amendments deal with matters of direct interest to my constituents and to schools in my constituency that have become grant maintained. Much of what I intended to say was in the same vein as the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter), who beat me to it—[<i>Laughter.</i>] The sense of humour of Labour Members is so refined that they laugh even before they have heard my intended argument on the matter of specialisation, which is an important feature of the Bill. It has not received sufficient attention in the speeches of Opposition Members.<br><br>
It may surprise the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) to learn that I agree with what he said about children being labelled as failures and deprived of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
the opportunity of a good education, for whatever reason. Those are valuable sentiments, which I echo. Although I would argue in a different direction from the hon. Gentleman, I agree with him on that. In the same spirit, I hope that he will remember this debate and agree with me on later clauses when we discuss matters such as the education associations that will take over failing schools. I hope that he will recognise that a school that is failing deprives a child of a good education. A child who attends such a school will be labelled a failure.<br><br>
The debate has focused largely on the old distinction between grammar schools and secondary modern schools. We have gone over the old ground of that debate at considerable length. By approaching the matter in that way, characterising it as a straightforward choice between secondary modern and grammar schools and going over the old debate of the 1950s and 1960s, the Opposition have missed the point. We now have a national curriculum. The important point is how it is to be delivered to a standard of excellence in each of our schools. There may be different ways of doing that, but all children are subject to the same curriculum. That point has been missed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about the national curriculum. Does he agree that the current arrangements for testing at key stage 3 in English mean that some children who would formerly have been taught Shakespeare texts now will not be able to study those texts in school because the form of assessment does not permit them to be studied? How can he say that that form of assessment at key stage 3 in English allows all children access to our literary heritage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady will not take it amiss if I say that I know that that is a matter of great concern to the National Union of Teachers, which has been doing its best to hawk it around as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hold no brief for the National Union of Teachers. It is quite unfair to blame one professional organisation. Every professional organisation in teaching—a rare event in the teaching world—has condemned that aspect of the national curriculum. Even the parent teachers association has added its weight to the considerable and mounting criticism. Whether one approves or disapproves, the way in which those measures were put through was cack-handed to a degree not seen for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Hertsmere resumes his speech, may I say that I do not see the direct relevance of the national curriculum to the debate? I hope that that will be borne in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was touching upon that subject, Sir John, but went further than I intended.<br><br>
Selection and specialisation are both important. Opposition Members are wrong to always speak about them as if they were the same. They make no distinction between them. Specialisation goes much wider. Opposition Members are wrong also to rule out selection in the cause of specialisation.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a school that specialises must necessarily be selective? It must select pupils who can specialise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making a perfectly fair point. Speaking personally, I would not rule out selection
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0664">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1009</span>
as a means to achieving specialisation. The hon. Lady will know that some schools plan to do that; some already do so to a limited extent. I see nothing wrong with schools doing that for a small part of their intake. They will build upon that to achieve specialisation and excellence. In many schools, 10 per cent. of admissions are already organised on that basis. I see no harm in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have lost the point of the hon. Gentleman's argument. He started by saying that Opposition Members confused specialisation and selectivity. He is now saying that he agrees with me that selectivity must follow on from specialisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Specialisation can take place without selection. The two do not necessarily go together. However, some selection may occur to achieve specialisation. I see nothing wrong with that because it will benefit the children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a school decides that 10 per cent. of its intake will be chosen for specialisation, how is it done if not by selection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ten per cent. of the intake may be selected. It may be part of the school's criteria to select children who have displayed a particular aptitude or ability in a subject. I do not see what is wrong with 10 per cent. of a school's intake being selected on that basis. That is of great interest to schools in my constituency that want to specialise in particular subjects. That is part of the richness and diversity of the system. That can be a great benefit in attracting specialist staff to a school, in building enthusiasm in the school, and in creating a good reputation. That will benefit the 10 per cent. of pupils who may have been admitted because they showed particular aptitude in a subject and the remaining 90 per cent. Unlike the hon. Member for Warrington, South, I look forward to a system in which parents have a choice of schools offering different specialisations. Parents who know that their children have a particular aptitude can try to guide their child to a school where that aptitude would best be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain that point a little further? He spoke about aptitude, but can he tell us of any tests used to select children for aptitude rather than ability? I am not aware of any.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schools consider what is known about a child from its previous school. That is one of the criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is being a little disingenuous. Of course schools can consider a child's past performance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give me a little time.<br><br>
I look forward to a system within which a range of choices and specialisations is available. The hon. Gentleman may tell us about specialisations that he would welcome in his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point that schools should be able to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
specialise. The clause seems to provide for exclusive rather than inclusive specialisation. Many perfectly good schools already specialise in German, Spanish, music, art or drama, thereby offering a great diversity within the comprehensive system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. He has told us of the great concern for the teaching of Latin and Greek in Hemsworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may correct the hon. Gentleman, the concern for Latin and Greek is in Featherstone, which is another part of my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may know that I am no stranger to those parts. From my many visits to Featherstone, I know the great love that exists there for the ancient languages of Latin and Greek. The hon. Gentleman referred to Featherstone rugby ground—where we often hear expressions in those languages. I may be mistaken, but I have always imagined them to be Latin or Greek because they are certainly not expressions that I know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Eheu! Eheu! Postume"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say "Nil desperandum" about specialisation. The amendments are unduly restrictive and would hamper the Government's policy of creating a diverse and rich education system with specialisation, many centres of excellence, and ensuring that excellence is available to all children. The sterility of the Labour party and the flat earth tendency within it have been revealed. For Labour Members, everything must be levelled, made the same, and be seen in terms of the old categories of secondary modern and grammar schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the prescriptive nature of the national curriculum provides precisely what he deplores?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the national curriculum is a means of ensuring a standard of excellence throughout the education system. I would have thought that he would have welcomed the application of the same curriculum to every school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could help the hon. Gentleman, who I think intentionally misleads the Committee. The national curriculum is not simply a means of teaching, it is a detailed prescription of a programme of work—a curriculum—which is an entirely different thing. It is a straitjacket and a nationalised and state curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled that we cannot debate the national curriculum this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour members of the Committee have constantly claimed that the Bill is a back-door means of returning to secondary modern schools, that—as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) put it in his characteristically modest way and with his usual charm and lack of self-regard—there is a hidden agenda. That argument was knocked on the head by the Minister's reply. He heard how many schools that had opted for grant-maintained status had applied for a change in character, and out of those—which were a minority—how many had applied for a change in character to the selection system that he described. What does he think has been happening during the past few years? Does he think that all of those head teachers and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0665">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1011</span>
governing bodies are part of a conspiracy with the Government, awaiting a secret signal to become secondary modern and grammar schools? Where is the evidence for that? The Opposition have missed the point. They are rooted firmly in the past. They cannot progress from the old division between secondary modern and grammar schools to a modern education agenda of specialisation, diversity and excellence that will equip children for the next millenium and enable them to accept the challenge of competition with other countries. The Opposition, who are stuck with drab uniformity, have exposed the lack of vision in their education policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been fascinating, but almost irrelevant. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said, the Opposition have failed to tackle the clause and amendment. Clause 85 re-enacts existing legislation. Under that legislation the floodgates have not opened and led comprehensive schools to become grammar schools. There is no reason to believe that that will happen in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recall this morning's debate about the merits of grammar schools. The Opposition asked whether Conservative Members would list the merits of secondary modern schools. Ashton on Mersey school is in the constituency next to mine, in the Conservative-controlled borough of Trafford. The school recently voted to opt out. When commenting about the decision, the head said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My interest is educational, not political. The principal attraction is the opportunity to go comprehensive."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand what that proves. It shows that the legal framework provides the opportunity for governing bodies of grant-maintained schools to choose a direction for the school.<br><br>
We have heard a lot of nonsense about grammar schools versus secondary modern schools. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, I do not disagree with the hon. Member for City of Durham. Grammar schools are irrelevant to the debate. Earlier clauses state that any school has the opportunity to submit a bid to the LEA to change its status. But schools have not done that because the debate about grammar and secondary modern schools was held in the 1960s and is now irrelevant. That is not to deny that the Labour Government of the 1960s perpetrated an act of educational vandalism. However, that was in the past. The Bill has nothing to do with a desire to introduce grammar schools by the back door.<br><br>
I was a member of Croydon LEA for 16 years. We reorganised our system in the mid-1980s because it included a peculiar arrangement of 11 to 14 and 14-to-18 schools. We reorganised on the basis of 11-to-16 schools and tertiary centres. One or two colleagues suggested introducing grammar schools. We will not return to grammar school education for a simple reason, which was given by the hon. Member for the City of Durham: for every winner under that system, there was a loser. Children were labelled as failures when they were too young. However, we support a system that offers diversity. I do not support a rigid framework, which states that school A must specialise in maths, school B in chemistry, school C in physical education. I want individual schools to specialise in the way that they want to, depending on local circumstances. I do not think that there will be radical
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1012</span>
changes, but there will be changes in particular areas. Those changes have nothing to do with introducing selection or grammar schools by the back door.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
There are various ways in which schools can decide who they wish to admit. A draft circular on school admissions has recently been published, which lays down important parameters on selection. Schools will need to follow it carefully.<br><br>
If we were to accept the amendment, we would impose a rigid straitjacket because an LEA would have the right to prevent a school from making a change of character. The thrust of the Bill gives schools the opportunity to break away from local authority control. It would be inconceivable that we would support an amendment that gave LEAs the right of veto. Therefore, I shall not support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved the amendment at 10.30 am, I did not realise that it would provoke such interest on the Government Benches, especially from Back Benchers who have taken the debate more seriously and who have been more revealing about their personal views than the Minister. We have heard several maiden speeches and there have been longer speeches on this issue than on any other that we have so far debated.<br><br>
Perhaps the keenness of Conservative Members to discuss grant-maintained schools and selection has something to do with their feeling defensive on the issue, perhaps because of the result that was announced yesterday of the ballot to opt out in the Prime Minister's constituency. The largest comprehensive in his constituency, St. Ivo's school, voted 72 per cent. against opting out.; only 28 per cent. were in favour. Perhaps that is why Conservative Members are so touchy, or maybe it is only the depth of their commitment to selection.<br><br>
The Minister showed uncharacteristic restraint in his speech. It must have been difficult for him and we appreciate the tightrope on which he was walking this morning. Anybody who heard his hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for Wyre Forest will understand the pressures that Ministers are under from their Back Benchers to go full steam ahead for selection where ever possible.<br><br>
From some of the contributions, it is evident that Conservative Members are split—some of them are more hawkish than others on selection. I am not sure why the Minister did not give us the full thrust of his personal views on selection because I find it difficult to believe that he does not have fairly strong views on it. This morning, he was unusually reticent. Perhaps it might have something to do with the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> which said that the Secretary of State might want selection, but did not want to say so and that his friends would discuss it instead.<br><br>
The Minister made revealing remarks about the amendment. His figures on the number of grant-maintained schools that have considered opting for selection may have been a disappointment to some of his hon. Friends. I am sure that they will take them on board and, no doubt, start campaigning for more. There has been no opening of the floodgates, although a newspaper report at the weekend described Southlands school as having its own entrance examination. Perhaps that is the thin end of the wedge. Conservative Members want us to move in that direction.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0666">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
The Minister criticised our amendment for running contrary to the notion of grant-maintained status for schools. He said that it was an attempt to compromise the concept of that status. He obviously associates grant-maintained status with selection and with accountability through the involvement of local authorities. The basic problem is that Conservative Members do not understand selection and the grammar school system. They do not realise that selection of a few affects the education opportunities of every child. I would go further and say that selection to a grammar school does not necessarily mean that the chosen few receive the best education possible. But we shall argue about that on another occasion.<br><br>
This has been a useful and revealing debate. Conservative Members have come out firmly in favour of a return to selection, which would downgrade the opportunities of the vast majority of children. The amendment is extremely important. We are grateful for the clarification that we have received from Conservative Members.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You know me to be a patient man, Sir John, but I have had to listen to the Opposition's inconsistent argument. They argue against specialisation, yet they condemn the publication of examination results on the ground that far more could be highlighted, such as musical attainment or sporting achievement.<br><br>
During the 1950s and 1960s there were many excellent centres of education in Wales called grammar schools. The Labour party, by sweeping aside grammar schools in Wales, contributed significantly to the demise of the national game of rugby football.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not intervening on the question of rugby, which I find singularly uninteresting.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I most certainly agree. The hon. Gentleman should be patient because I shall come to that shortly.<br><br>
We had many centres of excellence for rugby football in Wales.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has said enough for the time being. He should take his medicine like a man.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is on the subject of rugby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot embark on a discussion of rugby football. That would stretch our patience. I rule that we cannot discuss that now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely wish to emphasise the fact that those grammer schools were not only very good academically, but specialised in rugby football. I could name several famous such schools, but I shall refer only to Carmarthen grammar school and Gwendraeth grammar school.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman assure us that he is committed enough to his point of view to be in the Committee Room when the Division is called? I remind him that on Tuesday he was so committed to the Government's point of view that he put the Government majority at risk by being so incompetent as to miss a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fail to see what that has to do with the amendment. Does the hon. Gentleman know the number of the amendment that we are discussing? It is clear that he does not even known which amendment we are discussing.<br><br>
We had centres of excellence in education in Wales and they specialised in rugby football. I have mentioned the grammar schools of Carmarthen, Gwent and Llanelli—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. You have ruled that rugby football is out of order but the hon. Gentleman continues to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will relate his remarks directly to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I most certainly will, Sir John. I am talking about specialisation, which Opposition Members have argued against, but that contributed to the national game of Wales, quite aside from academic attainment. The policy of the Labour party swept aside those centres of excellence, so the national game of Wales has been in decline and that party stands condemned for that. I even hear the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) agreeing with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain to the Committee how selection for those schools took place? Did that involve a secondary modern tier? Some of his Friends have said that they do not agree about the provision of education. He is a rare agent for the grammar schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows how selection was made for grammar schools. My point is that because selection was made in accordance with certain criteria, that did not mean that those schools could not become centres of excellence in a quite separate field, if I may be pardoned for the pun.<br><br>
With regard to secondary modern schools, they, too, contributed enormously towards the national game in Wales and were centres of excellence. I refer the hon.

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 586, in page 50, line 4, leave out 'significant'.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment would be that schools allowed to select 10 per cent. of their entry on the ground of aptitude in music, art, drama or physical education would no longer be able to do so without applying for a change of character.<br><br>
Schools now wishing to change their character must go through a lengthy consultation process which involves publication of the details, full consultation with parents, schools and the community, and the allocation of sufficient time for people to make known their views before a final decision is made. We see no reason why schools that are given permission to specialise in music, art, drama or physical education should not have to go through the same procedure. Our amendment would ensure that they do.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The Secretary of State's decision to allow this type of specialism without applying for a change of character is contrary to the White Paper's stated intentions. Conservative Back Benchers must be especially disappointed. I did not realise quite how disappointed until I heard them speak today. The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that specialisation would lead to selection and thought that that was all right. But the White Paper refers to "a measure of specialisation" that "does not mean selection."<br><br>
It states that
<br><blockquote><p>"that implies choice by the school; instead it means increased choice for parents and pupils."</p></blockquote>
The decision to allow schools to select 10 per cent. for this type of specialism would be contrary to the recommendation in the White Paper. It also runs counter to the draft circular on admissions published by the Department for Education in December, which warned against the use of specialisation as a form of selection. I applaud the Department for issuing that directive. It warns schools that if they go towards specialisation, they must be careful not to select. So guidance from the White Paper and the draft circular states clearly that specialisation should not lead to selection, and warns against it, while the Secretary of State decides to allow some schools to go for 10 per cent. of entry without applying for a change of character—which it is said would be an element of choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady make it clear that when we speak of selection and specialisation and the 10 per cent. we mean selection for a particular specialisation—which may be music, physical education, science or technology? It is not across-the-board selection in academic subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. We are talking about selection for a specific purpose. I reiterate that the circular on admissions also makes it clear that it is almost impossible to test for aptitude. The test is of ability. The draft circular also warns that it would be unacceptable to take as a criterion for entry to a specialist school a child's interest in a specialism—music, art or drama. The circular warns of major problems with justifying that at an appeals procedure.<br><br>
We must accept that all the evidence is that we cannot test aptitude, we can only test for ability. So specialist
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
schools will have a hidden agenda for selection. There is no use pretending that they will choose on the basis of aptitude for music, dance or drama. The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) seemed to identify boys who were selected on academic ability and had gone to grammar school with great rugby players for Wales. Moving from selecting on the grounds of ability—as the 11-plus did—to expertise in rugby shows how difficult it its not to select across the range.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely interested in the hon. Lady's argument. I find it difficult to understand the hon. Lady's point that in any kind of selection, whether internal or external, we are talking about choice. People who like music might want to go to a school that specialises in music and people who are interested in technology may want to go to a school specialising in technology. I am not re-opening our debate on the previous amendment, because that issue has been thoroughly explored, but is the hon. Lady really suggesting that if a young person is interested in music, art or science, that should not be taken into account? The matter is not party-political, but I find her view astonishing and I do not think that she means it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that children's interests in such subjects have been well catered for by comprehensive schools for years. It is not as if there is no expertise in our schools.<br><br>
The real dilemma is that if a school is allowed to take 10 per cent. of its entry for specialisation in music, it will have a problem if more than 10 per cent. of applicants wish to go to that school to specialise in music. I am just quoting the draft circular on admissions, which states that a school should not be permitted to accept a chilid because that child has a stated interest in a particular subject. The DFE warns that that would not be defensible in a appeal from parents of children who were denied entry. That is the kernel of the problem. The White Paper and the draft circular are clearly against selection. Only when Conservative Members bared their souls to us this morning and made it clear what they would like to come out of the legislation did they show us the hidden agenda. The White Paper and draft circular do not refer to selection.<br><br>
The decision by the DFE to allow 10 per cent. on art, music, drama and physical education without going through a change of character consultation exercise is a covert means of introducing selection. When there are more pupils wishing to go to a specialist school than the school has places for, how does it choose 10 per cent? We are advised by DFE officials that it cannot be done by testing aptitude, because that is not possible, and that it ought not to be done by choosing children who have expressed an interest in that specialism. The provision will lead to a process of selection, based on wider ability and not just the specialism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady say what she would allow? In a sense, all she is saying is that if a school is full up there has to be some selection because not every child who wishes to go to it can do so. In every over-subscribed school there is, by definition, selection.<br><br>
I refer again to the Technology of the Arts college in Croydon, where there is great investment in studios and so on, for music in particular. Naturally, the school wants to ensure that pupils attracted to it have some aptitude for its special subject. The problem is that it wants to ensure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
as many children as possible from the locality attend the school. It also wants a wide range of pupils. The school tends to make its selection on the basis of the hours spent travelling. There must be some sort of selection. If selection cannot be based on aptitude, which the hon. Lady is writing out of the script—I would leave it in—what would she put in the script?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just suggested what Opposition Members have been saying throughout the consideration of the Bill. There is no choice, only the exercise of a preference. We have made that point time and again. It is right to say that some schools, whether they are comprehensive or based on selection, will always have more applications than places. That problem would not be solved by selecting on grounds of ability. I support the system in Birmingham: once a preference has been expressed, the school that a child attends is determined by how far he or she lives from it. That is acceptable—selection by ability or aptitude is not because the dangers of labelling and failure that have been described already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. The hon. Lady speaks of ability and aptitude in one breath. I am concerned with aptitude. Most schools that want to select on the basis of aptitude seek a range of ability commensurate with the school's expertise and the type of education that it provides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing—and I am supported in this by the Department's draft circular—is that it is almost impossible to select by aptitude because one ends up selecting by ability. The draft circular warns against that. When schools become specialised, they will have problems with selection on the basis of aptitude. Sometimes one wonders why schools choose their particular specialisms. For example, Langley Park school intends to specialise in music, but it has relatively poor music results at GCSE. There is also a city technology college whose results in technology are also relatively poor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the hon. Lady on the question of aptitude. I do not know whether she has visited the school in Croydon mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, but its staff teaches pupils with a wide range both of ability and aptitude. That is because selection is based partly on where the pupils live and partly on aptitude. The school neither discriminates against nor favours certain types of pupil, but it has a particular bent which is a great advantage.<br><br>
Will the hon. Member for Yardley say why she believes that the Birmingham system—under which where a pupil lives is the overriding factor—is better, morally or otherwise, than selection by aptitude? Does she mean that the children whose parents are wealthy enough to buy a home in an expensive area are morally entitled to go to a particular school, irrespective of their aptitude or ability? Surely that is the opposite of the hon. Lady's philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees that parents have little choice and that such problems can arise because of an excess of demand over supply. I support Birmingham's policy because it is easily understood. If constituents tell me that their children have not been accepted by the school to which they have applied, I can verify whether they have been treated fairly. I cannot verify the truth of the matter when parents tell me
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
that their child is brighter than one who has been accepted into a specialist school or a grammar school. There is a huge problem when more children want to go to a school than there are places. That is why parental choice does not exist and why we can talk only about parental preference. If one accepts that, I agree that any system to decide which children go to which school will cause disappointment for some people. That is why Opposition Members' do not con people and pretend to parents, pupils and communities that they can have a choice about which schools children attend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Lady is saying about aptitude, ability, selection and so on, and she makes an interesting point. How would she apply her argument in the case of schools where pupils are moving to, say, a sixth-form course? A decision will have to be taken on whether they should go to that form and take a particular subject. The hon. Lady may have an answer but it is not clear to me.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My experience in the city in which I taught was that, more or less, there was open enrolment in schools with sixth forms depending on which A-levels were taken. Local education authorities now actively encourage consortia and urge schools not to overlap in the A-levels which they offer. Matters settled well at sixth-form level and students went to the schools which offered their A-level subjects.<br><br>
The substance of our amendment is that those schools specialising in the subjects that I have outlined would have to go through the same procedures for a change of character as others that teach the introduction of specialisms. It is difficult to justify why schools that will specialise in maths, English, science or languages have to go through a procedure while those that specialise in the expressive and creative arts do not. If one reads the White Paper and the draft directive, one may believe that the Government do not want to introduce selection overtly. However, by not requiring those schools to go for change of character status, they are introducing selection covertly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be so late in intervening but I wanted to think about the answer that the hon. Lady gave to my question. What would happen to a young person in Birmingham who wanted to go to the sixth form but who, in the judgment of teachers or others, lacked the ability or qualifications that were required?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of the sixth forms about which I know, there are few that could not offer a course that would suit a child's ability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any child at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sixth form of which I was head offered A-levels, GCSEs and certificates of pre-vocational education. Our only criterion for accepting children in the sixth form was that they should be willing to follow a course of study and give it all that they had to achieve good results. We did not deny entry to children because of ability or aptitude but ensured that we provided a course for every child, no matter what his or her ability or fifth-year results may have been. I do not regard that issue as a problem.<br><br>
I did not speak in the debate on selection and I do not wish to go over that ground although we are still dealing with the same clause and a slightly different amendment. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1019</span>
said that the decision to allow 10 per cent. entry without going through a change of character consultation period will lead to selection. I shall make two points to explain why I believe that would prove exceptionally damaging.<br><br>
I cite the Secretary of State for Education in defence of my argument. I sat in the Select Committee before which he appeared some weeks ago, and I agreed wholeheartedly with something he said. I am not quoting his exact words, but he stated that the worst one could do to children was to have low expectations of them. He singled out the low expectations of some children as one factor that depresses levels of educational attainment. That is fundamental to my personal philosophy of education. When parents, teachers and friends have low expectations of students, they perform at a low level.<br><br>
I abhor structures that have low expectations of pupils but every system of selection and specialism has them. The schools, authorities, testers and people who send letters of acceptance or rejection institutionalise low expectations. That is my main reason for opposing selection and specialisation. As the Secretary of State said, institutionalised low expectations lead to low standards of achievement. No member of the Committee supports that. I refute the suggestion that there is no diversity in the comprehensive system.<br><br>
Two schools in my constituency, Cockshut Hill and Sheldon Heath, are equal in the league tables. Cockshut Hill is the most popular school in Birmingham. I have visited both schools many times. Differences in attitude, relationships between staff and pupils, and minor rules and regulations exist between those schools. Both schools are excellent. But hon. Members visiting the schools could not claim that they were alike. When I ask parents which school they have chosen, they immediately reply, "Cockshut Hill" or "Sheldon Heath". They perceive the differences between the schools. Diversity and choice exists within the comprehensive system. Cockshut Hill and Sheldon Heath are excellent examples of that. Both schools achieve excellent results and high behavioural standards.<br><br>
The Committee has put aside the question of what specialisation is about. The Government doubt whether they can devise objective tests for aptitude. They fear that they will test only ability. Langley Park school wishes to specialise in music, but it has poor results in that subject. Specialisation is not overt but covert selection. Schools that select 10 per cent. of pupils on their aptitude for art, drama, music and physical education operate the worst sort of covert selection. Under the Bill, they will be able to do that without undergoing the proper procedure for change of structure and character. The amendment would ensure that any school that wished to change its character by adopting a specialism and selecting 10 per cent. of its pupils had to undergo the full consultation procedure. Ten per cent. is a significant number. It will deny access to a school to 10 per cent. of children who live near it. The community has a right to support or reject such a proposal.<br><br>
I wish that legislation would provide for all schools which might introduce selection to undergo full and proper consultation. No justification exists for exempting such schools from the procedure. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to circumstances in Wales. In Wales, "change of character" refers, almost invariably, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
a change in the linguistic character of a school. The omission of that issue from the Bill is remarkable. The Bill contains some references to Welsh issues, but, on the whole, it has been drafted in ignorance of Welsh circumstances. I shall speak briefly—I hope that that is acceptable—about the way in which the character of schools has been established on a linguistic basis in Wales and how the Bill gives governing bodies the opportunity to recommend a change of character, which could endanger the current structure of bilingual provision in Welsh schools.<br><br>
I shall speak next about the development of language policy at primary level in parts of Wales where the Welsh language has remained the dominant spoken language. Some are rural areas, others are industrial. In those areas, Welsh has been established for many years as the main language of primary education. It is not surprising that the majority of pupils came from Welsh-speaking homes. It was sound educational practice and it was culturally enriching because it created an interaction between the local culture, the cultural institutions and the school. It was also an instrument for language maintenance, giving the Welsh language prestige and a higher place in the register of language use.<br><br>
During the past 20 years, that familiar, well-established pattern has been destabilised. That has happened because of the massive demographic change in western Welsh-speaking parts of Wales—the phenomenon of depopulation and re-population with an influx of people. At first, that change led to an erosion in the status of the Welsh language. Schools changed suddenly; at one time, about 5 per cent. of pupils came from English-speaking homes, but suddenly 30 per cent., 50 per cent. and 70 per cent. of pupils came from English-speaking homes. Teachers found it difficult to cope, and local education authorities found it difficult to devise policies to respond to that rapid change.<br><br>
However, during the past 15 years, LEAs have been increasingly able to tackle that problem. In Gwynedd and Dyfed, the two main western counties of Wales, that has been done mainly by confirming the historic primacy of Welsh as the medium for education, at least at primary level—adhering to what language planners would call the territorial principle. That assumes that people moving into an area will be expected to adopt the culture and language of the area. That applies to educational institutions as much as to anything else.<br><br>
Schools have developed models of bilingual education, which require that all pupils receive a substantial proportion of their primary education in Welsh. That was justified for several reasons. It has been a means of establishing effective bilingualism in pupils. Indeed, it is the only means of establishing it. It has enabled pupils to participate in the Welsh-speaking community life of which they have become part. There is firm evidence that children who are brought up to speak a high-prestige language like English, which is well-established at home and in the wider context, have a substantial educational gain from being taught for a considerable part of their time at school in a second language. It has also been justified on the ground of language maintenance.<br><br>
That policy has been controversial. The education authority in Dyfed is categorising schools by the language used for instruction. That has been criticised by some bodies. An organisation called Education First has campaigned virulently on that issue. Nevertheless, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0670">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1021</span>
policy has had widespread support among parents. It has also been sanctioned through the democratic process. The pattern is not uniform. In Dyfed, it has been modified by the provision of English-medium education, either in streams or in specific schools in the major towns. In those parts of Wales, an intricate pattern has been put together by the LEAs fulfilling their strategic planning functions. That task is incomplete and it needs elaborating. That will be possible only by an appropriate organisation taking an overview of the position.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
It should be obvious that giving power to governing bodies in grant-maintained schools to change the linguistic character of the schools could blow that carefully constructed pattern to smithereens. It could bring about a "significant"—to use the word contained in the amendment—change in the linguistic character of a school. We must bear in mind that a governing body by a simple majority—it could be made up of a minority of the governing body's members—could publish proposals and set the process in motion.<br><br>
It is true that the governing body would be obliged to consult and that it must have regard to the Secretary of State. It would have to have the approval of the Secretary of State. However, that is no guarantee that the Welsh language will be defended. It is unsatisfatory that the good will of the Secretary of State would be required. We might have a Secretary of State who is hostile to the Welsh language. That has occurred in the past. I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Welsh Office in his place. Perhaps he would like to follow on from what I have said. I am sure that he is already aware of the issues that I have raised.<br><br>
Decisions taken by governing bodies could lead to a fragmentation of the pattern that is being put together. In some circumstances, it could involve a majority of members of the governing bodies in individual schools carrying through that process, leaving a large number of parents in many areas without the provision of the medium of Welsh education. It could mean that many parents would not be able to have their children educated in schools in which the Welsh language has pride of place. After all, schools are communities. That provision could be lost under the clause.<br><br>
Will the Committee bear in mind that a significant change of character has occurred in Wales in establishing designated bilingual comprehensive schools, schools where about 80 per cent. of subjects are taught to all pupils through the medium of Welsh? That change of character has been implemented hitherto by a strategic decision that was made by the LEAs, which took into account the suitability of the location, the effect that such a decision would have on other schools in the vicinity and the need to provide an alternative within a reasonable distance. Such a systematic provision could not be made on the basis of decisions taken by individual governing bodies.<br><br>
It is worth my referring, too, to what has happened in Mid Glamorgan. Schools in that area that are regarded as surplus to requirements have had their linguistic characters changed, either by first closing them or by announcing the intention to change their character, thus enabling the provision of a bilingual school. The initiative for such a change come not from the parents of children at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
the schools or from governing bodies but from the local education authority as a result of a change in cultural attitudes and in response to parents throughout the country, not just parents with children at the school.<br><br>
Sometimes the changes can be contentious. How will the new system proposed in the Bill cope with such strategic development? Nowhere is there established in statute a right to Welsh-medium education or an obligation on the state to provide Welsh-medium education. It is doubtful whether the Welsh Language Bill which has begun its progress through another place will establish the right of parents to the provision of Welsh-medium education for their children or the obligation on the part of the state to provide such education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Language Bill, which was given a Second Reading yesterday in the House of Lords, will enable the Welsh Language Board to ask every local education authority what provision it makes for Welsh speakers in its area and to reach an agreement with every LEA about the services that it will provide. Among those services will be the provision of Welsh-medium education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to receive from the right hon. Gentleman that assurance that the Welsh Language Bill will deal with Welsh-medium provision. That is encouraging, but it falls short of a clear declaration of parents' right to Welsh-language education for their children. Nevertheless, I welcome that explanation of what the Welsh Language Bill implies.<br><br>
In Gwynedd there are secondary schools with complex patterns of bilingualism. In some of them, all the pupils receive at least some of their education through Welsh. Some pupils in the same schools receive 100 per cent. of their education through the medium of Welsh, including subjects such as mathematics and science. Some schools in Dyfed are introducing similar models. All that could be thrown into disarray if the governing bodies were free to change the linguistic character of schools.<br><br>
In Wales we have a system of varying provision, with a significant element of choice and diversity, which needs further development and refinement. That is currently occurring through the strategic decision-making process of local authorities. That process and the existing pattern could be seriously undermined if grant-maintained status spreads and governing bodies can recommend a change of character.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will say that that strategic and planning role may be exercised by the funding council, which will prevent the undermining of the process. If we are to have a funding council, I hope that it will assume such a responsibility. However, I cannot trust the funding council to do that unless legislation requires it to do so.<br><br>
A great majority of parents in the Tregaron and Lampeter areas—towns in my constituency, in the centre of Ceredigion—recently voted in favour of designating two schools as bilingual comprehensives. The balloting process involved the parents of children in primary schools. That is an important principle in balloting on the nature of a school. The local education authority adopted the decision as policy and proposed doing the same thing. The recommendation was rejected by the Secretary of State so there is now uncertainty and no provision.<br><br>
In the potentially anarchic atmosphere surrounding grant-maintained status and the combination of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0671">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1023</span>
responsibilities of the schools funding council and the LEAs, it is essential that the position of the Welsh language is protected and enhanced. I call on the Government to make proposals and give undertakings that would have a similar effect to the amendments that I tabled, which were not selected because I omitted to mention that they would apply only to Wales. The amendments would have required provision for education through the medium of Welsh in England as well. In an ideal world, I would not object to that because Welsh people need provision for education in English, but I would not expect the Committee to accept such a proposal.<br><br>
I appreciate being able to raise this point. I seek a commitment from the Government that this sort of certainty will be granted to the vast majority of Welsh people who want education in Welsh to be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North for being absent when he began his speech; he spoke earlier than I expected. Nevertheless, I am fairly familiar with his theme.<br><br>
I understand and support the hon. Gentleman's anxiety to safeguard provision for Welsh-medium education. I shall continue to try to reassure him.<br><br>
The Bill gives the Secretary of State power to safeguard Welsh-medium education. I can confirm that the Secretary of State would consider a change in the medium of instruction in any school to be a significant change of character.<br><br>
Where the funding authority—the schools funding council for Wales—or the governing body of the school intends to make a significant change in the character of a grant-maintained school, it is required by clauses 85 and 86 to consult before publishing proposals for change and submitting them to the Secretary of State for approval. Those clauses also provide that statutory objections may be made. These provisions on consultation and objection will invariably identify and highlight any implications for Welsh-medium education of the sort mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Proposals by the governing body must be approved by the Secretary of State, and proposals by the schools funding council for Wales require the approval of the Secretary of State if statutory objections have been made or if the Secretary of State notifies that his approval will be required. There can therefore be no question of a grant-maintained school acting independently, without the approval of the Secretary of State, in such a way that the provision of Welsh-medium education in any particular area would be prejudiced.<br><br>
As for proposals by the SFCW, I again remind the hon. Gentleman that where it shares responsibility to secure sufficient school places with an LEA, the SFCW will be under the same statutory obligations as the LEA regarding the planning and provision of Welsh-medium education. Given the nature of the subject, I find it difficult to imagine any proposal for a change of character involving Welsh-medium education that would not require the approval of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that it will not be possible for individual GM schools to change their character significantly without first convincing the Secretary of State that there is a strong case for doing so. I also assure him that, just as he does in the case of LEA proposals, the Secretary of State will take into account all relevant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1024</span>
considerations in looking at such proposals, including, among other factors, implications for the provision of Welsh-medium education.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
When considering proposals for a change of character in grant-maintained schools, the Secretary of State, in the exercise of that statutory function, will be obliged to take into account all relevant factors, including the outcome of the consultation process and any objections made. His decision in any case is always open to legal challenge on the ground that he did not reasonably do so.<br><br>
It would not be appropriate or, I suspect, possible to list in the Bill the factors that the Secretary of State will take into account. It would be even less appropriate to pick out Welsh-medium education—for example, in some cases a proposal to change the character of a school may have implications for the provision of English-medium education. Such cases have arisen in the past. Should we include in the Bill a clause that provides that the Secretary of State should be satisfied that there is sufficient English-medium provision in the area?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North referred to the situation at Lampeter and Tregaron. He will recall the proposals by Dyfed local education authority to designate secondary schools at Lampeter and Tregaron as bilingual schools. There were objections to those proposals and the matter came before the Secretary of State for consideration. I shall not go into detail, but the Secretary of State rejected the proposals. One factor that persuaded him was the effect that they would have had on the comprehensive school at Aberaeron, which is a predominantly English-medium school. That was an example of the Secretary of State taking a decision even before enactment of the Bill.<br><br>
We have included in the Bill provisions that will safeguard the tremendous progress made in the development of Welsh-medium education in recent years and ensure its further development. That progress has been made under sections 8 and 76 of the Education Act 1944. I have made it clear that the proposal to establish the schools funding council for Wales will be implemented only in response to the wish of parents to see a significant grant-maintained sector in Wales. Its primary purpose will be to administer grants to grant-maintained schools; but where a significant number of pupils in any area attend grant-maintained schools, the council will also have responsibility for the effective administration of the grant-maintained sector in that area and will work alongside the LEA-maintained sector to secure sufficient school places. We covered that matter when we discussed clause 7.<br><br>
It is clear that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North is still confused and anticipates a curious chaos existing between the LEAs and the grant-maintained sector. However, current responsibility for the planning and provision of school places clearly rests with the LEAs. Their statutory obligation to provide suitable education—including Welsh-medium education—is well established by the 1944 Act. However, they will find it difficult to undertake that responsibility if increasing numbers of schools in their areas become grant maintained and outside their control. We want to ensure that in such cases the interests of pupils in the area are not jeopardised. That is why we will impose similar obligations on the schools funding council to secure sufficient school places,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1025</span>
including provision for Welsh-medium education, in the grant-maintained sector. Those duties will be no less than those placed on LEAs in respect of their sector.<br><br>
We are ensuring that there is no scope for either sector to avoid its responsibility to provide education of the highest standard, responsive to the needs of pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has painted a rosy picture of the future of Welsh-medium education under a schools funding council and if schools become grant maintained. Why then is almost the entire establishment in Wales dealing with Welsh-medium education—a host of bodies such as the Society of Teachers in Welsh, comprised of highly respected academics, and the Welsh Joint Education Committee—opposed to the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I have clarified the picture. There has been a certain amount of opposition in Wales because the Bill has not been understood. Indeed, its provisions have been deliberately misinterpreted by many people in the Welsh education establishment. Let's face it, there are vested interests in LEAs in Wales, as elsewhere. Those vestdd interests are clearly protecting themselves. They are not thinking primarily about the wishes of children and their parents with respect to grant-maintained schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will regret those words for a long time, because the issue does not involve LEAs alone. There are great political differences between LEAs in Wales and the Government, but I am talking about respected academics and institutions in Wales, non-political bodies that are completely opposed to the proposals and specifically those for the teaching of Welsh language and teaching through the medium of Welsh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From my reading of correspondence and representatons to the Welsh Office I am led to believe that the intentions of the Bill have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted. Of course there is always an innate security in the status quo. Welsh-medium education has done pretty well under the status quo, but there is no reason for its progress to be adversely affected by the Bill's proposals.<br><br>
I appreciate, Sir John, that you have been most tolerant, but may I add that the Bill places a duty on the LEAs and the schools funding council for Wales to provide each other and the Secretary of State with such information as he may require about their provision of education. It will therefore be open to the Secretary of State to require the grant-maintained and LEA sectors to provide information about, for example, the projected demand for Welsh-medium education and their proposals to meed the demand. That is an important new measure, which can be used to monitor the current provision of Welsh-medium education and proposals for its development. I repeat that nothing in the Bill threatens Welsh-medium education. Our proposals to establish a curriculum and assessment authority for Wales and to transfer responsibilities to it for the development of Welsh language classroom materials are significant new measures to safeguard and strengthen the provision of Welsh-medium education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause, were it amended by the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley would remove some doubt about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
what could be interpreted as significant. Specialisation is a means of creating selectivity. How will the specialism be determined within schools? I ask the Minister to recognise that schools can establish specialisms within the comprehensive system without adversely affecting the intake of the comprehensive system in a particular area. If schools start to take 10 per cent. of pupils on the ground of their aptitude for music, for example, the comprehensive nature of the network will be reduced. I am interested in the Minister's response to those important points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that there are times in the Committee when we try to find common ground. To an extent, we have been successful. There have been occasions on which I have happily accepted the content of Opposition amendments and have agreed to return to them later. There are occasions on which the amendment reveals a difference in philosophy, attitude and approach to the subject. That difference might, in the end, be irreconcilable and unbridgeable. I regret that this may be one of those occasions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yardley, rather uncharacteristically and perhaps unintentionally, did less than justice to the DFE circular on admission arrangements. I seek to rectify that by fully quoting the circular. That would go some way towards putting the matter in context and helping the Committee to see the matter more in the round.<br><br>
Paragraph 38 of the circular states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If a school or LEA does wish to support specialisation by selective admission arrangements, it will in most cases need to publish statutory proposals for a significant change of character of the school. The Secretary of State will consider all such cases on their merits, and in the light of the views of the local community."</p></blockquote>
We have covered that ground and it is familiar to the Committee. The key paragraph, to which the hon. Member for Yardley alluded, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, the Secretary of State believes that the introduction of a strictly limited amount of selection, involving the selection of a total of not more than 10 per cent. of pupils on the basis of ability or aptitude in one or more of music, art, drama and physical education will not in general lead to a significant change in the character of the school as a whole. Ability in these subjects is not a proxy for overall attainment across the curriculum, and the overall level of ability of pupils at the school is unlikely to change significantly. Nor is a change of this size likely to lead to a significant narrowing of parental choice in the area served by a school."</p></blockquote>
Committee members will realise that that quotation places the matter in a wider context. If I may be so bold as to speak for my hon. Friends, we are much happier and more at one with the concept of specialisation than Opposition Members seem to be, although they conceded that it might have a place. The difference is that we argue that it is legitimate to do what the circular says and to allow selection of not more than 10 per cent.—an arbitrary figure, I admit—on the basis of ability and aptitude in one or more of a limited range of subjects. Those subjects are music, art, drama and physical education.<br><br>
What I am about to say always gets me into trouble, but I shall take the chance. It is that time of the day and members of the Committee are probably as indulgent as they are ever likely to be. Given that it is not morning when hon. Members are sharp and alert or late in the evening when they might be thinking of greater or different things, I shall characterise the subjects as not being mainstream academic subjects. There, I have said it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah, I thought that that might elicit a reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell me whether the selection is 10 per cent. of the school population or 10 per cent. of a specific intake at any one time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has stumped not only me but my officials, and that takes a bit of doing. They will talk among themselves for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I help the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I can help the hon. Gentleman before he helps me. I shall explain why his hon. Friend's question is so good. I referred, as does the circular, to not more than 10 per cent. of pupils. I agree that that could mean either the total population of the school or the intake. I shall receive clarification of that point in a moment when discussions behind me have been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it were 10 per cent. each year of the total school population, within three years the school population would be doubled. Clearly, the figure must refer to a single year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the hon. Gentleman's classical languages are better than his maths. If the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport were present, he could no doubt verify the hon. Gentleman's mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is Euclidean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that it is not Pythagorian, because that would have really got us into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) has exposed a weakness in the Government's position. The issue is a key part of the Bill. Will the selection be 10 per cent. of one year or 10 per cent. of the school population? The Minister cannot answer. As I understand it, the figure must refer to pupils. That must be made clear in the Bill; it is not clear in the Minister's mind. I hope that the Minister can now reply because he has in his hand an advice note from his officials.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing a little time to pass. I can now confirm that the figure refers to 10 per cent. of the admission number—the intake. That might get round the mathematical problem posed by the hon. Member for Hemsworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean 10 per cent. of the admission number for the school as a whole, or 10 per cent. of the admission number for any one year? There is a fair distinction to be made between the two. Which does the Minister mean?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the year. If Opposition Members wish to use the time of the Committee in this way, I am happy to allow such dialogue to continue almost indefinitely. It does not give me any particular discomfort. It might shock Opposition Members—it might even shock some of my hon. Friends—but I do not claim to know every detail not only of the Bill but of associated matters. I want to take my time in answering the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and give him the proper answer. If he wishes to ask me another question, I hope to be able to answer it but, if not, I shall answer it subsequently.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need answers to such important questions. It is better that we have them now rather than when the Bill becomes an Act and is being implemented. The Minister referred to the admission number. He will know that the admissions number is never hit precisely. If the admission number was 150, it would be unusual to hit it precisely. If 100 pupils are recruited, is that 10 per cent. a percentage of the 150 admissions, or of the 100 pupils actually recruited?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am going to take a flyer on that, without checking. It has to be the admission number, not the actual number. Obviously, the admissions process must be based on a number: it cannot be based on the actuality; that would represent an internal contradiction. Even I spotted that. I shall let the hon. Gentleman have another go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on that question, because I want him to confirm my interpretation of what he said. The answer seems to be 10 per cent. of a notional figure—the admissions number—not 10 per cent. of the number of pupils admitted. Will the Minister accept my interpretation that, in practice, the number of pupils selected on the basis of aptitude will be more than the actual 10 per cent.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the assumptions that the hon. Gentleman made and on the figures that he has given, yes, that must inevitably be so. The hon. Gentleman has merely pointed out the result of what often can happen. If one starts with an arbitrary percentage and works through a series of circumstances—I could use that charming word, scenarios—the result might be as the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, it does not make an enormous difference to the substance of the issue between the hon. Member for Yardley and me, which comes down to an interpretation of the aims and objectives and the means to achieve them. We have said repeatedly that we are prepared to contemplate a regime of the sort outlined in that admissions circular, which rests on a concept not only of specialisation but a degree of selection based on aptitude.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea often makes percipient points in his interventions—I wish that he would make speeches more often, as we would then receive more of his guidance. He pointed out that there is inevitably an element of selection all the way through the education system. Whether we like it or not, we have to accept that and most Opposition Members do. How the elements of that selection are graded is a matter for genuine debate. We believe that it is likely to be benefical to the education system if we admit that degree of selection based on aptitude and specialisation, as defined in the circular, over a range of subjects specified. It is delineated in that way.<br><br>
Opposition Members choose to make a different judgment, namely that our judgment undermines the whole concept of education. They approach it from a different view point, which is that comprehensive education, as pure in practice as they can make it and eliminating an element of selection, is much more desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a crucial point. As I said before a selection may be inclusive or exclusive. It is important to recognise that. It is the exclusivity in the clause that worries me. Inevitably there is selection in any school when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
judging aptitude, which is difficult even when a child has been known for six or seven years. It is the exclusivity rather than the inclusivity that worries some of us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but it would not necessarily have the result that he suggests. We are probably talking more at the margins of the argument than we realise. It is not as absolute as has been suggested, or as the hon. Member for Yardley suggested, partly for the reason given by the hon. Member for Hemsworth. It is suggested that there is a continuum, which would start with the purest form of comprehensive education—I use the term loosely for the purpose of the argument—or the purest form of selection on full academic ability. There is a spectrum, and somewhere along that spectrum there is a legitimate role for specialisation and for the 10 per cent. quota arrangement, because it would add richness and diversity. The Opposition are trying to get as close to eliminating any concept of specialisation—as I have defined it—as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right that there is a fundamental division in the Committee. Will he set my mind at rest on one point? It may seem pedantic, but what would happen if a school tried to specialise in more than one area? Is it possible to accumulate the 10 percentages? Nothing that he has said so far seems to exclude that possibility. In theory, it would allow for 50 per cent. of the school population to be selective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the nature of the question, but the answer is no—there is no possibility of accumulation. There is a numerical limit of 10 per cent. of the pupils, as it has been defined—the hon. Member for Wallsend helpfully encouraged me to define it more and more closely. A school cannot take 10 per cent. of each category and add them up. The 10 per cent. is a total figure.<br><br>
I am conscious of the hour. The hon. Member for Yardley made no secret of the fact that the amendment seeks to undermine, eliminate or undercut the idea set out in the admissions circular. For that reason, I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment. We believe that our circular makes sense and that schools should be offered such flexibility. It is near to the hearts of all Ministers in the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that there is fundamental difference of opinion in the Committee on the wish to have specialisms. The amendment would not lead to the wrecking of specialisms in schools, but would include the same procedure for schools wishing to specialise in art, drama, music and physical education as for those wishing to specialise in any other subject. The amendment safeguards the rights of parents and communities to express their opinion on whether their school should become specialist in any area. It does not wreck specialist schools, but affords parents and communities the same consultation that the Government have afforded to people associated with schools that seek specialisms in any other subject.<br><br>
No justification has been made for treating the subjects differently, except—this is the kernel of the Minister's views—that they are somehow lesser subjects and are not valued as much because they are not mainstream academic subjects. Such views are not well received in schools, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
which teachers of those subjects try their best to raise standards. Ministers and the Department for Education imply that they are lesser subjects, which is not the best way to encourage excellence. Unless the Bill is amended, the Government are confirming that such subjects are of lesser value and should be treated differently from, in the Minister's words, other more academic subjects.<br><br>
Parents, governors, communities and teachers have as much right to say whether their school should become a specialist in these parts of the curriculum as in any other. I hope that the amendment will find favour with the Committee.</span></p>

authorities throughout the country of successful groupings of small schools in an area. The Bill's provision is well in advance of current experience of groupings. In particular, the single governing body has not been tried in many areas. Our support for the principle of groupings notwithstanding, we are concerned that schools will fear that they will lose their autonomy within a grouping. The Bill does not deal with that problem. I had hoped to be able to move several amendments to clause 107 that would have done so. Perhaps the Minister can reassure me that measures will be introduced at a later stage that will deal with it. For example, would the Minister consider minor amendments to ensure that each school within a group would have a representative on the governing body? I see the Minister nodding, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.<br><br>
The clause concerns the mechanism for establishing such groups. When a school seeks to become grant maintained and a member of a group at the same time, it faces a major decision. The decision to become a grant-maintained school is by itself a major one—to do that and join a group is an even greater step. Because of the potential loss of autonomy for a school joining a group with a single governing body, such a decision must be considered carefully by everyone involved. That is why the amendment proposes that 28 days' notice should be given of the governing body's intention to debate and decide on such a resolution.<br><br>
Earlier in our proceedings, we discussed the proposal that there should be a 28-day notice period before a governing body passed a resolution on grant-maintained status. We debated the possibility that such a resolution could appear, without notification, among "any other business" at the tail end of a governors' meeting. The Minister went some way towards reassuring us that proposals would be produced to prevent that and that there would be a lead-in time of a minimum of seven days. The amendment acknowledges those proposals but suggests that a longer notice period of 28 days would take account of the extra element involved in a school deciding also whether to become part of a group or cluster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the break, the Minister said that he would welcome the odd speech or two from me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He will come to regret it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He might. Sometimes Members of Parliament have to make confessions. One was made earlier about newspapers, and now I must make one too. I shall do so in the terms used by my hon. and much lamented Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth—just now he appears to have urgent business with Plymouth—who referred to a Cadbury's Milk Flake. This clause reminds me more of a Nut Cluster—certainly, it is the product of a nutty cluster of thoughts.<br><br>
Seriously though, after that provocative remark, I must say that, like the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), I am not sure how workable the clause is. I accept that it has been included in the Bill as an option that can be rejected, but I have been known to wake up in the middle of the night worrying about it. There have been other proposals in the past to bring schools together so that they share facilities and staff. In my former local education authority, one of our experiments in local management of schools had schools sharing a bursar. It made a lot of sense to merge schools' administrative support systems.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1033</span>
Each school has its own head teacher, governing body, staff, pupils and parents. One of the clause's proposals is that representation on the governing body of a cluster of schools would rotate yearly between the respective head teachers. What would that do for continuity of governance? It would only undermine the role of the head teachers.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Bath said, we have not debated this question sufficiently in the past. If we are to have the so-called clusters of schools, surely it would be better to have a single head teacher, even on multiple sites—rather like a rural vicar who looks after several parishes—with a good deputy on each site.<br><br>
I use this occasion to express my concerns about the cluster concept. However, I accept that it is an option and, as such, perhaps it can be improved. I shall welcome any reassurances from the Minister, as will schools which are considering taking up the option.</span></p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Battersea has some sympathy for the amendment. I expect that each of us would probably disagree with anything the other said about what happens in Wandsworth, so it is interesting that we should agree on the importance of the amendment. I hope that the Minister will take heed of what his hon. Friend says, as none of us likes the idea of the hon. Member for Battersea waking up in the middle of the night from a dream about nutty clusters. That is a vision abhorrent to us all.<br><br>
Chapter 12 of the White Paper says that this proposal will help primary and rural schools to become grant maintained, as attaining that status can be difficult for very small schools. In addition, as the hon. Member for Battersea mentioned, small schools and village schools provoke fierce loyalites among pupils, parents and the community which they serve. So it is important that they believe that they will get a fair share if they become part of a cluster.<br><br>
I am not happy with the Bill's definition of a cluster as "two or more" schools. I do not see how two schools can make a cluster. I should have thought that that would be an amalgamation rather than a cluster, but I do not want to be pedantic.<br><br>
It is important that the Minister give his hon. Friend the Member for Battersea the reassurances that he seeks. He should also guarantee that it will not be possible for, say, three schools in a cluster to gang up on a fourth, and siphon it off, as it were in a way that is not representative of the school. I fear that small schools may seek cluster status because they are having difficulty coping. That makes them more vulnerable.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will provide reassurance and that he will accept the amendment, which aims to deal with some of the dangers in clause 114.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, express reservations about the concept of clusters of schools and have a number of questions about it.<br><br>
Presumably the rationale behind clusters of schools being able to attain grant-maintained status is to enable small schools to seek grant-maintained status. What size of school will be eligible, and how will "small" be defined? There is a danger that the largest school in the group could dominate the others, especially in respect of the number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
parent governors. The Bill provides for between three and five parent governors, but no more than five. If there are six or seven schools in a group, some will be unrepresented. There should be a provision to ensure that each school has a parent representative on the governing body.<br><br>
Will the funding council have powers to decide the level of grant or the eligibility for funding of a group of schools? Will it be able to make payment of a grant conditional on the closure of one of the schools? Groups of schools considering setting up grant-maintained status in those conditions must tackle those questions. I share hon. Members' serious reservations about the concept of grouping.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea spoke, because he put his finger on a matter that we must all bear in mind from the start. The concept of clustering of schools is an enabling provision that we thought would help some schools in certain circumstances to find the possibility and practicability of grant-maintained status more attractive and workable. Therefore, right away we must fix in our minds the idea that no school will be forced to join a cluster.<br><br>
A very small school might find that a more attractive way of achieving grant-maintained status. I must say to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North that there is no lower limit on the size of schools that would qualify, just as there is no lower limit on the size that would qualify for grant-maintained status. I think that I am right in saying that the smallest grant-maintained school has 12 pupils. A very small school may be viable as a free-standing, separate, autonomous unit and entity. However, if the governors and parents believed that a clustering arrangement would be advantageous, that option is open to them to pursue.<br><br>
I shall return to the intriguing concept of rotating heads, which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea raised. We may want to ponder on that for a while. Perhaps the hon. Member for Hemsworth will reminisce about rotating heads. It may be intriguing to imagine in which circumstances, if any, he and his hon. Friends rotated. That brings me to a general point, which will help hon. Members to put the issue in context. We have accepted already, in principle, an amendment of the hon. Member for Bath that would allow grant-maintained schools to form a group, in addition to joining an existing group. That shows the flexibility that we have agreed to introduce.<br><br>
I want to go further, in response to points made by hon. Members, to determine how much more flexible we can make the arrangements. I have in mind measures such as making the head teacher of each school in a group eligible to be a member of the governing body. That would help to solve some perceived problems, such as representation. The hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) hinted that some people fear that there might be a complete lack of representation of one or more schools in a cluster. Allowing the head teacher of each school as of right to be a member of the governing body would be helpful. However, we should make that optional so that, if one or more heads thought that such representation was not required, or if they wanted to rotate, it would be open for them to take such action.<br><br>
It would also be worth considering allowing secondary schools to participate in a group of schools. I concede that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
there are arguments for and against that, but I have given the matter thought and I tend to the view that it would make sense. Again, I stress that it is always for schools to judge whether it is appropriate for them to join others. They will want to take a view about compatibility and shared or common interests and to feel comfortable about the constitutional arrangements. In some cases, they may feel threatened by that but that will be for them to judge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The idea of a pyramidical cluster is interesting. Does that mean that children in primary schools at the base of the cluster would automatically be expected to go to the seconday schools at the pyramid's apex?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the difficulties, or downside of the concept, that I had to consider. The answer is that those children would not be obliged to go to those secondary schools. The question is whether there would be perceived or actual pressure on them to do so and whether that would be good or bad. There is no reason why it needs to work that way, but careful thought would have to be given by the governors of each school to whether it might work in that way immediately or later and whether that would be beneficial. My straightforward answer is no, that would not need to be the case.<br><br>
Given the concept of clustering, it is sensible to make it as flexible as possible within very broad limits. We turst governors and parents, so we shall accept their views on whether they regard that as being in their interests and act accordingly within our ground rules.<br><br>
If the Committee follows my suggestions, we shall need to consider the composition of governing bodies. I fear that if we try to force mandatory representation of every school at a level beyond that of heads, for example, we could end up with large, unwieldy governing bodies. That would not be desirable, so we must find a way of composing governing bodies with balanced representation on one hand and manageable size on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister said and I hope that he will take into account that, under clause 108, the provision for teachers' representatives is different from that for heads' representatives. A teacher, however elected, serves a term of four years and a head serves for one year. The implication is that that would give impetus for each head to serve a year if there were, say, four heads. As I said, that would be unsettling not only for the heads but for the good management of schools. We should at least give thought to bringing that into line if we proceed with such a scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is a fair point. I shall give the Committee an example which is not quite off-the-cuff because it has been written down for me. I cannot claim any spontaneity for it, but it gives a flavour of our thinking.<br><br>
Assuming a group of three schools, a governing body might be composed of, say, five core governors, three parent governors, one or two teacher governors and up to three head teachers. That provides a maximum of 13 people, which might be about right for three schools. However, one could permutate the composition almost endlessly, but it will be a matter of striking the right balance.<br><br>
I am running ahead of myself, but I considered that I should let the Committee know our thinking.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for sharing his thoughts with the Committee. For practical reasons, I suggest that we take a cautious approach further down that route because we are likely to give many hostages to fortune in trying to amalgamate governing bodies. Those of us with experience of sitting on governing bodies for schools know that some schools did not always think that they had fair representation. I am glad to note that the junior Minister acknowledges that. It is important for the main board to be fully representative. The size of the board will make it difficult for it to deal with such schools.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
Although we want to encourage schools to feel part of the total community, and although the pyramid relationship is often strong, I hope that the Minister will realise that, if secondary schools are to be in a cluster with primary schools, expectations could be created among parents of children at a primary school that the children would automatically go to a particular secondary school, whereas that might not be the case.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to be cautious about the practical implications of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept all that the hon. Lady says. Perhaps that is why I am being uncharacteristically tentative about the best way forward. The proposal is experimental. I know that there are schools throughout the country that have already made such arrangements. Of necessity, there will be a more formal arrangement. That is why it is important for us to try to build in as much flexibility as possible, while ensuring that the arrangement will be practical and workable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he is uncharacteristically tentative. It is pleasant to reach a stage in a debate where we have a frank exchange of views on a section of the Bill that is rather vague. Will the Minister confirm that, when there is a precise formulation dealing with the groups, it will not preclude voluntary co-operation among small schools that do not form an official cluster? That may be the way that some small schools want to go, initially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and I would always encourage that. It is at one with the concept of local management of schools and increasing delegation of responsibility in the continuing LEA sector. It is also at one with grant-maintained status. Such schools will be encouraged to consider their circumstances and what is best for them and to seek various co-operative arrangements—for example, for purchasing services or for arrangements such as those to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North referred in a previous sitting, when he spoke about schools making joint arrangements to provide facilities for eisteddfods. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What makes the concept of an eisteddfod amusing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I lived for a short time in west Wales. I shall not do so now, but I can count from one to 10 in Welsh. That used to be one of my more modest party tricks.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath has been waiting patiently for me to turn my attention to the amendment. I tried to be as positive and upbeat as possible, but he may not be surprised to learn that, with a little regret, I shall ask the Committee to consider rejecting his amendment. I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1037</span>
already said, and the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, that we intend to change the Education (School Government) Regulations 1989 to include consideration of grant-maintained status as a named agenda item and to make provision for seven days' notice of the agenda and the meeting at which the item is to be discussed.<br><br>
It is a straightforward matter of judgment whether seven days' notice is enough, or whether there should be a longer period of notice, such as 28 days. My view is that seven days is adequate for the purpose. We touched on the matter in an earlier discussion. I am not persuaded that the period should be extended to 28 days. Experience has taught us that the seven-day provision is enough. With the change that I suggest to ensure that the agenda is clear and that there is no chance of it being hijacked under the rubric of any other business, that is more than adequate for the purposes for which it was intended.<br><br>
Without further ado, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask for your guidance, Sir John, because the Minister's remarks ranged so widely and showed such flexibility that I thought it was a splendid opportunity to mention a subject that interests me greatly. The fact that it has not been discussed previously is the principal reason why I have not contributed significantly in Committee.<br><br>
The issue that interests me is that of special schools and their relationship with primary schools. Since the concept of grant-maintained schools came into being, special schools have examined the possibility of working in clusters and becoming grant maintained. I am being—what is the word I want?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flexible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could use that word. I was going to use the word "daring", because I was about to consider the existence of primary schools in the special schools sector as a way of introducing the subject to the Committee.<br><br>
Primary schools exist in the special schools sector, and I am a great believer in their continued existence. It was with some relief that I read Baroness Warnock's contribution to the conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, at which she said that her own committee had been naive in recommending complete integration. I would like to see the continuation of special schools, with the ability for them to become grant maintained.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee long, but will my hon. Friend the Minister be sufficiently flexible to comment on the possibility of special schools becoming grant maintained on a cluster basis? I am conscious that funding for that would be exceedingly difficult. However, I hope that my Friend the Minister will agree to special schools becoming grant maintained in clusters, provided that the funding can be organised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Sir John, I shall take this opportunity to announce my intentions. Next week, I shall bring some amendments before the Committee. I apologise in advance because, when hon. Members see the amendments, they will blanch—they might do worse than that, but that is certain. Regrettably, there will be many amendments because they cover a complex issue. They will give effect to our White Paper undertaking to allow special
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
schools to apply for grant maintained status. That is my wish and I shalll ask the Committee to accept the amendments.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) is perhaps asking me to go one step too far. However, I want to think about her request because it is a novel concept for a special school, once it has become grant-maintained, to have the ability to form a cluster with other special schools or join a cluster with mainstream schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention takes the form of questions. Will the Minister ensure that every member of the Committee will receive copies of the amendments at the earliest possible opportunity? When will we be able to see them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to table the amendments tomorrow, in which case would they appear on Tuesday's amendment paper? Would they appear in Tuesday's business? [<i>Interruption.</i>] They will appear on Tuesday. I am trying to help the Committee by answering the question, and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. AcAvoy) should not be so dismissive.<br><br>
I will endeavour to make copies of the amendments available tomorrow in the Table Office. I cannot undertake to distribute them to all members of the Committee. For many members of the Committee, it may not make any difference whether the amendments are available on Friday or on Monday. However, I shall try to ensure that the amendments are available to the hon. Member for Cambridge and as many of her hon. Friends as possible. That is the best that I can do now. I appreciate why she asked the question and I want to be as helpful as possible because I have nothing to hide. I do not intend to spring something on the Committee.<br><br>
The reason that the amendments come so late is that they are complicated. This had proved a difficult matter to tackle and I am only now able to bring the amendments to Committee. I hope that hon. Members will look favourably upon them. I cannot say anything further to my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait). If I may, I shall consider the other points, but my initial reaction is that the combinations that she suggests would prove especially difficult. The reason is that, because special schools tend to be far apart geographically, it may prove difficult in practice to have them functioning as a cluster in the way that the Bill defines. It may not be quite as difficult to invisage such a school forming a cluster with neighbouring mainstream schools although this might in turn give rise to a series of problems that could make it difficult to incorporate it at this stage. I cannot be as helpful as I would wish, but I hope that my hon. Friend will look positively on the coming amendments, which I shall try to distribute to as many members of the Committee as possible tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In an effort not to damage the spirit of the debate, I ask the Minister to reflect during the next couple of days upon whether it might not have been better for the Bill to have been allowed the longer gestation period that many of my hon. Friends have sought. He and his officials would then have been able to consider the provisions in greater detail. That would have negated the need for so many amendments—especially relating to special needs provisions. The fact that the Minister will table a great many amendments will probably make us blanch. We shall also be a bit cross at having so little time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1039</span>
to examine them and consult colleagues who are not members of the Committee. I offer that suggestion gently in the spirit of the debate.<br><br>
The debate has been useful and you, Sir John, have allowed it to range widely to allow us to discuss issues relating to clusters. The important point that has emerged is that there are legitimate anxieties shared by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee about the arrangements for clustering. Many of us feel that if there are to be GM schools, some of which will be small, the question of opportunities for them to work together in some way may be worth exploring. I refer to both voluntary measures, which the Minister has assured us will be possible, and those that are covered by legislation. In the latter case, it is vital to get it right, and important to ensure that that form of co-operation will enable individual schools to retain some autonomy over their actions.<br><br>
We knew that a number of amendments would be tabled—I draw the Committee's attention to new clause 24, which addresses the issue of the application of maintenance grant for groups—and now we are told that there will be many others. It would be more helpful if I sought your leave, Sir John, to withdraw the amendment until we have all seen the Minister's proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 602, in Clause 114, page 68, line 18, leave out 'submission' and insert 'publication'.<br><br>
This is a technical amendment to ensure the correct wording of this subsection. The governors' proposals for forming a group will be published rather than submitted.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 618, in page 68, line 25, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Regulations shall require in the case of each school which is not a grant-maintained school but where the Secretary of State has notified the existing governing body that he is minded to approve the proposals submitted by them under subsection 2(c) above with a modification that would exclude one or more other schools from acquiring grant-maintained status as member of the same group—
<ol>
<li>the consent of the governing body to that modification, or</li>
<li>the withdrawal of the proposals.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
We must stay on the issue of clustering and the intervention of the Secretary of State in respect of proposals that may be made. I put forward a possible scenario, seeking the Minister's guidance on how it will progress.<br><br>
9.15 pm<br><br>
Let us assume that a group of schools chooses to form a group seeking grant-maintained status. They will go through the procedure, which is laid down rather more clearly for individual schools in clauses 20 to 24 than in clause 114. At some point, before making his final decision, the Secretary of State has the opportunity to insist on various modifications to the proposal. Let us assume that one of those requirements is that one of the schools in the group is not allowed to continue as part of the group. The proplem is what will happen then. If we follow the procedure laid down in an earlier part of the Bill for single schools, the Secretary os State has the duty to consult the governing body of that school, but once it has been consulted, the proposal could still go ahead.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
In the scenario that I propose, that could cause difficulties. Having lost one of the members of the proposed cluster, the governors of the other schools may not wish to go ahead. They certainly would want the opportunity to debate the impact of the loss of that one school from the cluster. They would want to see what impact it would have on the viability of the management arrangements. They would certainly want to be assured that the new, smaller cluster was able to serve the community in the intended way. Certainly they would want to be assured that they had the support of the parental body. Yet, under the Bill, there is no opportunity for that apart from the requirement that the Secretary of State consult the governing bodies.<br><br>
That is an extreme case. The amendment proposes not only that the governing bodies should be consulted, but that they should give their consent to a smaller cluster. Further, in the event of their not being satisfied with the new arrangement, rather than having to seek the Secretary of State's permission to withdraw the proposal, they should have the automatic right to withdraw the proposal.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will reassure me that those fears of an imposition on the governing bodies of a group of schools, will not be realised. I have looked carefully through the Bill and I see no reassurance. I look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess—it might be the lateness of the hour—that I found it quite difficult to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. The difficulty was compounded by the fact that our reading of the amendment was that the school that is excluded from the group by the Secretary of State's modification would effectively have a veto on the formation of the cluster. That is the interpretation that my experts have put on the amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, to whose legalistic mind I always defer, seems to have a similar interpretation. If that had been the burden of the amendment, I was going to say that I did not think it right that it should happen that way. It would be odd if a proposal had to be withdrawn because a school that had been excluded by modification by the Secretary of State did not give its consent.<br><br>
I understand the point about carrying all the schools included in the cluster, but it struck me as odd that it should work the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, I do not have experts available to me as the Minister does, so I will defer to their expertise if I am convinced, but the amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Regulation shall require in the case of each school".</p></blockquote>
Reference is made in the first line of the amendment to "each school". It then states that the governing bodies shall do this, that and the other. It is clear that that refers to the governing body of each school. In the event that one school is denied membership of the cluster, the governing bodies of the other schools should have the right to decide whether they wish to go ahead with forming that cluster. That is the purport of the amendment. Perhaps the Minister can tell me what I have got wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem arises later in the amendment, because it goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State has notified …. he is minded to to approve … with a modification that would exclude one or more other schools from acquiring grant-maintained status as member of the same group … the consent of the governing body to that modification, or … the withdrawal of the proposals."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1041</span>
I suspect that that is where the confusion lies. In any case, I am now beginning to wonder whether it would be a good idea for the hon. Member for Bath to withdraw his amendment—it would be rejected if he proceeded with it—on the understanding that, if he writes to me setting out the reasons for the amendment, I will undertake to consider the matter carefully and, if persuaded, either advise him on how he might proceed—that would be rather unusual but I am happy to do that—or bring an amendment forward myself. It would be unwise to proceed on the basis of a confused amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something that the Minister said earlier set me thinking. He said that perhaps I had had experience of rotating heads. I have had no experience of rotating heads, or any other sort of heads. If a voluntary-aided school came into the cluster—be it Jewish, Anglican or Catholic—it might get swallowed up by the cluster. Has his Department reflected on that and has he any comments? I am not asking for an answer now as it is a technical matter. I am happy for the answer to come later, but I want to put my oar in now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I can probably give the hon. Gentleman assurances, but I shall not give them on the hoof. I shall write to him and set out a considered answer to his question. I think that such a school would be reasonably safeguarded. The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting and important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is core governors and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly. It will depend on the relationship of the voluntary-aided school core governors to the new governing body of the cluster that it seeks to join. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with a detailed response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a slight difficulty because the purpose of such an amendment is partly to get the Minister to explain his own legislation. He has not explained what would happen in the scenario that I described. Nevertheless, given that he has offered to consider carefully my concerns about the Bill and given his unprecedented offer to help me draft an appropriate amendment, it would be foolish of me not to accede to his request to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To make it clear, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman writes again to me setting out the anxieties that underlie the amendment. I shall then examine them and see whether I can reassure him that the existing provisions will meet those anxieties. If I cannot do that, and I consider that his worry is justified, I shall explore whether I can introduce a measure later in our proceedings. It will be a two-part process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be boring to repeat what the Minister has just said. I am grateful for his offer and I accept it. I may seek the linguistic advice of the hon. Member for Hemsworth, too. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 620, in page 68, line 50, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Where a grant-maintained school intends to submit proposals to become a member of an existing group in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above, regulations shall provide—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
<ol>
<li>in relation to that school, for no decision taken at a meeting of the governing body of the school that would result in the publication of proposals for that purpose to have effect unless it is confirmed at a second meeting of the governing body held not less than twenty-eight days after the first, and</li>
<li>in relation to those proposals, for them to be submitted jointly by the existing governing body of the school and the single governing body of the group.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment recognises that joining a cluster constitutes a significant change in the character of a school. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the same balloting or resolution procedure that applies to changing the character of a school should apply when schools want to join a cluster.<br><br>
The second part of the amendment stresses that if proposals for a school to join a cluster are introduced, the single governing body of the existing cluster and the governing body of the school wishing to join it should unite to form one proposal, so that those who make the ultimate decision know that everyone is in agreement. I hope that the amendment will have the support of all members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not necessary because when a grant-maintained school wishes to make a significant change to its character, for example, it is required to pass only a resolution of its governing body. To all intents and purposes, joining a group or cluster can be regarded as a similar procedural change. Therefore, a second resolution should not be required. Generally, we are moving away from the concept of two resolutions.<br><br>
As with all statutory proposals, a proposal to join a group must be published and that would allow parents and others to make their views known. Furthermore, the detailed arrangements for joining a group will require the governing body of a school that wishes to join a group to obtain the consent of the group governing body. I envisage that being done through the regulations under clause 114. In that sense, the group will have agreed to the proposal. First, we do not need, nor should we involve ourselves in, second resolutions. Secondly, the substance of the hon. Gentleman's argument can and will be achieved through regulations underpinning the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps having had the opportunity to look at clause 85(8), the Minister would be willing to intervene in my winding-up speech. He will see that, under the change of character provision, in the event of there being objections there can be a second ballot with a 28-day gap between the two. The Minister told us that that did not occur, yet there is reference to such a procedure in the clause. I am speaking slowly in the hope that the Minister may say that, during my absence from the Room, he has deleted the clause. Clearly, he has not, so perhaps he will write to me later or communicate with me in some way to enable me to understand why he is objecting to my proposal when the same measure applies to the change of character under clause 85. Joining a cluster could mean a change of character, too.<br><br>
I am sorry that I seem to be causing the Minister some problems. The hon. Gentleman told us that he had some party tricks. One of them is to count from one to 10 in Welsh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has just occurred to me that one could probably say—it may be unusual, if not unique—that the entire Government Front
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1043</span>
Bench can count to 10 in Welsh. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy can and I also can. That is a remarkable treble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools now has the answer.</span></p>
<p>9.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be the hour, but I am finding it astonishingly difficult to follow relatively simple things. I probably misled the hon. Gentleman, myself and therefore the Committee. As provision already exists under clause 85(8) for a second resolution it is not necessary to have it in the form that he suggests in clause 114. The matter is already covered and need not be repeated in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the Minister is telling the Committee that a governing body's decision to join a cluster is defined as a change of character. That has not been stated so far, but it can only be covered by clause 85 if it is so defined. It would be helpful to have some reference to it in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that "define" is not the correct term to use, but for all intents and purposes it will be treated within the same framework as a change of character. For that reason it would come under clause 85(8), as the hon. Gentleman pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will be willing to check with his officials that my amendment is unnecessary in order to ensure that that is the case. They could reflect on that at perhaps not such a late hour.<br><br>
If it is not the case, I hope that he will be willing to admit that there is a need to take the matter further. Given the assurance that my amendment is covered by the legislation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the lateness of the hour I shall be brief. As the debate has been somewhat wide-ranging it might have been possible to have made my comments on one of the amendments.<br><br>
I shall discuss the important matters raised by the Minister. They concern the widening of the opportunities on clusters. The cluster arrangements are important and should be widened to include secondary schools. A cluster—which is currently only for primary schools—could benefit if a secondary school was included within it. Thus, we would be able to reflect some of the normal cluster arrangement undertaken within education authorities. It is not impossible to ensure that the arrangement is restricted to the principal primary feeder schools for a particular secondary school. The matter is touched upon in the White Paper. I hope that the Minister will pursue it.<br><br>
I understand some of the practical problems that have been mentioned, one of which was raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East. She mentioned that she did not want an arrangement in which pupils within primary schools would be locked in to a secondary school within whose group they were within the grant-maintained sector. I agree with her, and I also agree that a pupil from another primary school should not be locked out of the secondary school in that group. However, that is not a problem. Primary and secondary schools exist in clusters and pupils can move inside or outside them. It is not impossible to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1044</span>
provide for a grant-maintained cluster to ensure the movement between primary and secondary schools that the hon. Lady and I would like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Lady agrees that there are problems. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) said, pupils often expect to attend a senior school with which they have some connection. Parents also expect that. We should be aware of the problem, just as we should be aware that nursery school pupils expect the first option to attend the primary schools to which they are attached. Clustering can be problematic and we hope that the Minister is aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. We must ensure that the flexibility between clusters extends to the grant-maintained sector.<br><br>
The Minister said that a governing body must reflect the cluster in which it exists, be it mixed or one of either primary or secondary schools. There is a need to ensure that no one school dominates a cluster. There are difficulties, but they can be overcome, and the option has advantages. The Bill is about options that are available to schools, communities and parents. I want to ensure that people have opportunities and are not limited to one type of education. The major difference between Labour Members and the Government is that the Opposition seek to stamp one form of education on the country. We seek to ensure diversity. I hope that diversity can be extended through a grant-maintained cluster arrangement.<br><br>
The Local Government Commission will shortly rove the country, as Opposition Members have mentioned. It is likely that there will be a variety of forms of local government in future that will result in some county councils ceasing to exist. If that happens, education authorities as we know them will also cease to exist. That will concentrate the minds of many school governing bodies on the question "What do we do next?"<br><br>
Every governing body should consider grant-maintained status annually and report the results to the annual parents meeting. The local government review and the changes that will occur as a consequence of it is an example of a change in circumstances that will make people consider matters that they would not otherwise contemplate. If we offer schools and parents a wider option to seek alternatives in the grant-maintained sector—for example, single schools, schools in primary clusters and primary schools that are attached to a secondary school—we shall improve the thrust of the Bill, which will increase choice and opportunity.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the Minister. At our previous sitting, we discussed whether my cup was half empty and his was half full. My cup will runneth over if he can clarify the clause.<br><br>
The clause deals with over-age pupils who attend schools. It makes sense for the community and for schools if adults and pupils who are slightly older than 18 participate in school activities. Some A-level courses could not go ahead without that extra participation. My hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1045</span>
Friend the Member for Devonport told me about a local firm that trades with Germany and sends members of staff to learn A-level German with ordinary pupils. That benefits the school and enables the course to continue. The Committee would support community use of school resources to expand the curriculum and to provide extra revenue for the school as well as a facility for people in society. However, the clause states that unorthodox pupils—if I may use that term—should not be taught.
<br><blockquote><p>"at any time in a room where pupils are at that time being taught except in such circumstances as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
It is beneficial both to schools and the community to allow over-age pupils to attend school courses, yet the Bill treats those circumstances as unusual and states that they require special permission. Can the Minister tell us who would prescribe the circumstances? Perhaps he could define also the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to place on record my deep unhappiness about the wording that we use in legislation. That has nothing to do with the pros and cons of the Bill. It will take me a long time to work out the meaning of the words that the hon. Gentleman read out. Can he explain them to the Committee? Parliamentary language is unsatisfactory and not good for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. I am tempted to say, in true ministerial style, that I shall write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not. I hope that the Minister can clarify the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two schools in my constituency where adults join A-level classes. In one case, a mother is studying the same A-levels as her daughter and her daughter helps her mother with her homework every night. It is important that that continues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can think of similar cases, particularly in community colleges. Should a community college seek grant-maintained status, the problem would increase. I want to know what "prescribed" means. I hope that it does not mean outside normal school hours, because that would exclude people to whom we are referring.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for this short debate, which I think has been helpful and on which I shall endeavour to shed light for the benefit of the Committee.<br><br>
I rise with some trepidation, but at least the text is grouped under the—I should not call it suspicious—title, "General and Miscellaneous" and one tends to find that such entries escape the Committee, which is concentrating on the major issues.<br><br>
Several hon. Members have raised important points. First, I shall say something in defence of the Department for Education. Even if the excellent lawyers who advise us on such matters and the parliament draftsment want a document written like this, when we do not need to write in legal terms, I think that the committee should know—as this happens to be in my direct sphere of responsibilities—that the Department for Education recently won a crystal award from the Plain English
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1046</span>
Campaign for its booklet on student grants and loans. With the assistance of my admirable officials, I think that I understand what is going on here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I should like to complain about the letter from the Secretary of State which was sent yesterday. I am sure that it was written not by officials but by the Secretary of State himself, because the English and punctuation were appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we all do our best. I shall do my best to answer the points. I shall make two more general points to the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd). First, I hope that, in giving my answer, I shall be able to fill his cup to the brim, and even make it overflow. Secondly, I think that there is no dissent in the Committee that the practice to which he referred is highly desirable practice, where it is appropriate. The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned the perfectly reasonable situation in which a school might have excellent facilities, for example for teaching modern foreign languages, with a language laboratory, and people in the town might be interested to join in. The hon. Member for Hemsworth mentioned the wider community implications. I am interested in family education and it is good if parents and their children who are pupils of the school want to learn together. On the other hand, a school is a school and it is for the pupils. Such desirable activity at the margin should not be intrusive or prevent the provision of services to pupils of school age. For that reason, the issue has been extensively debated. I owe it to the Committee to bring us up to date.<br><br>
The clause replicates a similar provision in section 13(3) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It places a duty on the governing body of a GM school to ensure that, in exercising its power under clause 60 to provide full-time education for those aged 19 or over and part-time education for those aged 16 and over, such education is not provided at any time in a room where primary or secondary pupils are being taught except in such circumstances as may be prescribed—I think that is where my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North found such offence in the wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I still do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the Committee will be aware that the Further and Higher Education Act amended the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 to enable the governing bodies of LEA-maintained and grant-maintained schools to have the power, with effect from August 1993, to provide further education—that is, part-time education for those aged 16 or over or full-time education for those aged 19 or over. However, that power is subject to the proviso that such education cannot be provided at any time in a room where pupils are being taught, except in such circumstances as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. That should answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Stretford. The philosophy is reproduced in the clause.<br><br>
Taking into account the positive elements and the potential negative one that that provision could get in the way of the pupils, there was considerable debate during the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, about the original proposal to limit the circumstances in which schools could make such provisions. It was suggested that those circumstances be confined to sixth form classes and other classes leading to public

examinations. Discussions were held about where the line should be drawn. We took careful note of the arguments and amended the Bill to provide for the circumstances to be set out in regulations. That was useful.<br><br>
We are considering the responses to a proposal set out in a draft circular. When we have done that, we shall bring forward regulations. That is reasonable, and I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
