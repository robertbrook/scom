	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 644, in page 93, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'() for the provision of legal advice and assistance by way of representation under Part III of the Legal Aid Act 1988, for representatives who appear on behalf of the child or the child's parents.'.</p></q>
The amendment would deal with some of the difficulties that might arise as a result of some of the decisions taken by the Committee this morning, especially that to keep the requirement in clause 158 that the chairman of the tribunal should have at least seven years legal qualification. There is genuine anxiety that, because of that decision, tribunals will become overly legalistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Members of the Committee will be aware that when tribunals have been established and the chairman is required to be legally qualified, that has encouraged them to become legalistic in their approach. Those tribunals that are chaired by a lay person are more informal and not so legalistic … Many hon. Members will have had that experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's point about legalistic tribunals. All lawyers would do well at all times to steer clear of being legalistic—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I consider it a serious allegation to call a lawyer legalistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but does he consider there to be a distinction between the chairman of a tribunal who takes a legalistic approach—that would be an unhappy development—and one who applies his legal training and experience to do justice in a case and to help the parties as much as possible? It is possible to apply legal training while, at the same time, taking a humane and practical approach to the merits of a case and the sensitivities of those involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) responds, I remind the Committee that we have completed the debate about membership of the tribunals and that we are now discussing a separate issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Sir John, for that guidance. I am trying to show why legal aid would be necessary for representation. If the tribunals consider cases legalistically, the case for legal aid for the persons appearing before them is strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a common agreement on both sides of the Committee that tribunals should act informally and that the experience of the parents appearing before the tribunals should not be threatening or daunting. We must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1188</span>
recognise that the tribunals will have to consider many difficult issues. It is important to ensure that parents are given proper and appropriate support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait) pointed out this morning that the tribunals would be seen as a "court of the last resort". That explains in simple terms the importance that will be attached to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment recognises that the tribunals will often have to deal with difficult issues. It is, therefore, appropriate that legal aid is available for representation at them. It is strange that legal aid will be available for advice to parents in preparing their case to put before the tribunal, but that it will be denied for the representation itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members feel that the advice procedure will be less daunting and complex for parents than the presentation before the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate this morning identified that the tribunals will be subject to the provisions laid down by the Council on Tribunals. As a result, they will be judicial in nature—whether we like it or not—and the proceedings will be complex and daunting. No matter how much we want the proceedings to be informal, they can never be given the powers that the tribunals will have. They will have the power to summon witnesses, to discover and produce documentary evidence. They will also require people giving evidence to swear an oath and, if somebody refuses, the person will be committing a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about a cosy, fire side chat. The tribunals will have all the powers of a court of law, namely, to compel appearance of a person; to discover documents; and to charge the individual with a criminal offence, if he refuses to co-operate. That is why we feel that legal aid would be appropriate for representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the proceedings that will be daunting; the law will also be complex. On Tuesday, we began to identify the difficulties that might be caused because of the application of the law. This morning, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said that points of law would be raised in the tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood me, or I may not have expressed myself sufficiently clearly. I referred to the same material to which he has just referred relating to the operation of the powers of the tribunal—which I suggest are very important—rather than to it taking points of law. I hope that the tribunals will steer away from the creation of precedent and the like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we would all welcome that, if it were possible. I am afraid that, from our experience of tribunals, that is not the case. Tribunals operate in several different areas and precedents are set. If there are legal chairmen, they will talk to each other—we know the nature of the legal profession—in various establishments and precedents, either formally or informally, will be duly established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proceedings will not only be daunting, but parents will have to deal with complex legal issues. I do not want parents to be left alone or with the support only of a friend in such circumstances. It is important to provide parents with the support of legal aid for representation. That suggestion would not break new ground. There are tribunals in which legal aid is available for representation, for example, in the Lands Tribunal; in employment appeal tribunals and in mental health review tribunals. All types
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1189</span>
of legal aid are available for those tribunals, which begs the question of why we should treat appearances before the special education needs tribunal though it was a second-class tribunal. The Committee recognise the importance of setting up that tribunal. It should be valued and given sufficient support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its 33rd report, the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee suggested that six areas should be considered when deciding whether legal aid should be applied to a tribunal's work. Four of those areas apply specifically to special education needs tribunals. The committee believes that legal aid should be available, first, if a high proportion of cases involve difficult points of law. Tuesday's debate showed that that is likely. Secondly, it should be available where the issues being considered involve complex or disputed facts. That will often be the case as disputes will be between a local authority and a parent. Thirdly, it should be available where a substantial proportion of respondents are represented—local authorities will have legal representation and, fourthly, where the tribunal's decision may lead to a loss of livelihood or sole source of income. It is important to children with special education needs that we decide on the right provision to ensure that such a thing does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Chancellor's advisory committee has identified four priorities which, I believe, the special education needs tribunal satisfies. A local authority will always have representation. No matter how much we would like both parties to go to the tribunal seeking consensus and compromise, the tribunal will be the last act of a difficult and drawn-out process. It would be useful to write a process of arbitration into the Bill, but we have not tabled an amendment to achieve that which has been accepted by the Chairman. Local authorities have large law departments and will brief experienced barristers, if not Silks, who take a case on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs should come as no surprise. If the tribunal decides that a statement should be amended—it has that power—to provide education in an independent boarding school, the cost to the local authority will be between £20,000 and £25,000 a year. Substantial sums of money will be involved. A local authority will brief counsel for a two or three day appearance so that it is properly represented in view of the large costs involved. I do not want a lone parent, perhaps supported by a friend, to appear before a tribunal and be faced by a local authority and all the powers available to it. Legal aid should be made available to such parents to ensure proper representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence of and research into the work of tribunals clearly demonstrate that applicants with support and legal representation have a far higher success rate than those who appear alone or are supported just by a friend. The Lord Chancellor's Department commissioned research from Hazel Genn, reader at Queen Mary college, university of London, on the effectiveness of representation at tribunals. It was published in 1989 and examined three tribunals that are relevant to the special education needs tribunal. It was found that 42 per cent. of appeals to the social security appeals tribunal were successful when applicants appeared alone. Over half were successful when there was legal representation. Only 9 per cent. of immigration appeals were allowed in total or in part if the individual was alone or backed by a relative or friend. If
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1190</span>
a solicitor appeared alongside the applicant, 37 per cent. were successful. Over half the cases brought before industrial tribunals in which applicants had the support of a solicitor were settled or allowed. The success rate of individuals appearing alone or with a friend or relative was down to one third. The Lord Chancellor's Department's research shows that providing legal representation boosts considerably the chances of success. That begs the question, should not the Committee try to support parents and improve their chance of success? If we do not support the amendment, we shall vote to accept a system that will make fewer parental appeals successful than if legal representation was granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, as my experience as a magistrate shows, not only does the unrepresented defendant fare less well, the cost to the court or tribunal is greater because of the extra time involved? If someone who knows the relevant law is present, not only is the defendant—or in these cases, the child—better represented, the system runs more efficiently and the result is fairer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The report that I quoted referred to the cost effectiveness of representation in tribunals and concluded that legal representation enabled them to deal with applications much more speedily than if an applicant was legally unrepresented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By providing legal aid for representation, we are likely to encourage parents to appeal to the special educational needs tribunal because they will feel that they have support of legal aid. They will then be more likely to take their case to that court of last resort. That is not merely a forecast; we have seen the result of the Children Act 1990. The Lord Chancellor's Department provided legal aid for representation in a judicial review of a decision taken under that Act. Whereas before the Act fewer than five cases were taken annually by parents, in the first year after enactment almost 100 cases went for judicial review because parents had legal aid, and last year 120 such cases went to the High Court. Those figures illustrate that parents will avail themselves of that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish the chair of a tribunal to be legally qualified. The law will be complex, and procedures daunting. The Lord Chancellor's advisory committee recommends support by legal aid in those circumstances. We must create opportunities and increase parents' success rate. Legal aid would do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position was well stated by the hon. and learned Member for Burton (Sir I. Lawrence) in a debate on the Legal Aid Act 1988. The hon. and learned Gentleman who now chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said that a time when people's rights are increasing and expanding, it is not good enough for tribunals to be outside the legal aid scheme so that poor or poorer people do not get the advice or support that they need to guarantee their civil rights. Our amendment is relevant. If the Government refuse legal aid representation to applicants for tribunals, they will deny parents their legal rights. The Act will provide parents with the opportunity to achieve justice while denying them the means of securing it. We hope that the strength of our arguments will find favour with the Minister and that he will respond positively to our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1191</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the motivation behind the hon. Gentleman's arguments. As the Minister said this morning, we are covering new ground in considering the tribunal. We would like the tribunal to develop in a way that balances the need for legal rigour in making its important decisions, with the need for informality, which will maximise the number of people who feel comfortable when they go to it with inevitably sensitive issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand entirely, as I am sure do all Committee members, that it is important that we do not provide a gate without the means to go through it. I agree with the hon. Member for Wallsend that it would be wrong to deny certain parents the opportunity to go before a tribunal because they did not feel that they could afford legal representations—which would no doubt be necessary for a fair hearing if the tribunal developed as I would expect after the amendment were passed. However, the amendment would not necessarily lead to the development of the kind of tribunal that I would wish to deal with such sensitive matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, if amended, would mean that the regulations may, in particular, provide
	<br><q><p>"for the provision of legal advice and assistance"</p></q>
as the Law Society has described it. The Law Society produced the amendment, which would obviously give further work to its members, though I do not necessarily say that it is disingenuous because of that. However, the word is only "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 160 is only an enabling clause. It would be left to the regulations as to whether an agreement could be reached with the Lord Chancellor's Department about a legal aid budget that has already doubled in real terms in the past five years and which the Lord Chancellor wants to rein back. It would be up to the Department for Education to discuss with the Lord Chancellor's Department whether the money might be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. The amendment is intended to raise the whole issue of representation and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is sponsored by the Law Society. I should welcome a publicly financed representation scheme covering special educational needs tribunals only. Such a scheme, which could be provided by way of regulation, would allow lay advocates, who need not be legally qualified, to support parents. It would not, therefore, need to come from the legal aid budget. The Minister has suggested that that might be possible. I think that many Opposition Members would welcome it and, from the comments that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) has made, it appears that perhaps he is also taking that line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting idea which could probably be pursued, but my principal reservation about the idea is that, by making legal aid available to all, we would make certain that the formal, legalistic type of tribunal that we wish not to emerge, will emerge, that is particularly likely given the fact that clause 158(1) lays down that the chairman will be a legal person, whether barrister or solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that, if anyone who appears before a tribunal is automatically legally represented, then obviously the local education authority will be legally represented. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Wallsend about the significant financial implications of the tribunals for many local education authorities. For
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1192</span>
instance, somebody aged 14 could well involve an authority in additional expense of £75,000 over a few years. Clearly, legal representation is likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local education authorities—my own included—have drafted lawyers in to their special educational needs departments in anticipation of such an argument. However, I still worry that if we allow for across-the-board legal representation, inevitably it will set in aspic the tribunals for special educational needs. Those sensitive matters will be discussed in mini courts with arguments dominated by three lawyers taking a central role in the process. I do not know how to get around that conundrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way to resolve the problem would be to follow the example of the Solicitors Complaints Bureau tribunal in which there is no legal representation. The arguments relating to educational issues would be put to the experts on the panel. If necessary, a parent can bring a friend to argue the case. What worries me about that approach is that the local education authority may send an expert to the tribunal and blind the lay members with science on the subject of special educational needs, making the parent seems relatively amateur by comparison. We want the parent's case to have the possibility of success, without guaranteeing that in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that these are matters for the regulations and we must learn from experience. The regulations must be made in such a way that they accept that the tribunal will have a legal chairman and that there may be some difference in legal representation between the parties involved in the tribunals. However, it should be laid down via a code of practice or by expectations that the LEAs and the parents would not normally have legal representation because the tribunal is informal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worthwhile considering the kind of scheme that the hon. Member for Wallsend justifiably proposed if the local education authority or the parents ignored the code of practice and were always represented by lawyers. Given the fact that we are breaking new ground, that is the only way to ensure that the tribunal will be sufficiently informal, but nevertheless rigorous, without necessarily setting in aspic a legalistic, lawyer-dominated tribunal, which no member of the Committee wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A couple of things struck me while listening to the debate. First, this is the kind of amendment that the Minister might accept because it could be presented by the Government as supporting the individual against the collective bureaucracy of local education authority. Secondly, I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend, who is a lawyer, say that things should not be too legalistic. I was surprised and pleased to hear him say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said and I broadly agree with his argument. However, while we all want an informal tribunal at which people can sit and try to achieve a compromise rationally, in the real world that will not happen. We must accept that at each stage, the Lea will be represented by lawyers: it will have a legal department which it can consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most members of the Committee will have had experience of constituents who are in dispute with LEAs about statements. I do not need to tell hon. Members about parents' strength of feeling when they are in dispute. They feel strongly that they know their child best and know what is the best provision that can be made. Those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1193</span>
parents who can afford it will seek legal representation to match that of the local education authority. The poorest sections of the community, which are least able to put the case effectively when confronted by experts and lawyers and the most likely to be intimidated, will have no access to legal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wyre Forest referred to informal tribunal hearings. Even if it were possible to leave lawyers out of the process, most ordinary parents would find it daunting to debate the technicalities of education law with the experts whom the LEAs would employ or call in. Ultimately, the most vulnerable people will be left exposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend mentioned the research carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department, which shows that people are more likely to be successful in all tribunals if they are represented. We all know that legal aid and the green form scheme will be available to parents for the preparation of the case. We are talking here about extending that to representation. I do not think that that will cost much. Obviously, cost is an issue, but if legal aid assistance is being provided already in the preparation of a case, the cost of representation will not be a great extra burden to the Treasury and it will help the most vulnerable parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome clause 160(2)(f), which provides for representation. However, to include that in the Bill without making provision for legal aid for the poorest sections of the community will render it meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the contributions to the debate have been interesting. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest on the need to avoid the legalistic aspect of the tribunals. I was worried about the comment of the hon. Member for Wallsend when he implied that he could envisage circumstances in which a local education authority would be prepared to spend considerable sums of money on legal representation to try to prove a case against a parent. Even though his experience of LEAs seems to have been far more favourable than mine, I would be surprised if an LEA incurred such expenditure simply to prove that it was right, rather than to achieve a balanced results for the child whose needs and future were being discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify my point, which I obviously did not do earlier, I was trying to say that we must reflect on the fact that by amending the statement, which the tribunal would have the power to do, the LEA could incur considerable extra expenditure. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest gave the example of a statement relating to a 14-year-old that might involve the LEA in extra expenditure of up to £100,000. In those circumstances, a council taxpayer would feel that the local authority should represent its position effectively and, indeed, would feel aggrieved if the authority was not represented properly at a tribunal for which it might pick up a bill of £100,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the point about proper representation that I was trying to make. Given the nature of what will happen, that will be seen to be in conflict with what the parent wants. By its very nature, the tribunal will be adversarial, which we all regret, but that is the practical reality. There are large sums involved—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1194</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a very long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has clarified his statement, for which I am grateful. Perhaps we shall return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent five years on education appeals committees. That experience is relevant to many aspects of the clause and to the way in which tribunals will work. Parents brought all manner of cases to those appeals committees, in which we considered special education provision for their children or, more commonly, where their children attended school. That experience is still appropriate. As the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) said it might have been the hon. Member for Wallsend, but the hon. Gentlemen tend to look the same. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] Perhaps I should have a closer look outside. Whoever it was, it is true that the least able and poorest parents had most recourse to the appeals committee. Other parents were able to work the system better beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two points based on that experience. First, it is essential that the tribunals are seen to be truly and totally independent, as was discussed earlier, and that they appear to be judicial in nature. Parents who resorted to the appeals committee, regardless of whether they got the decision that they wanted, were often very upset to discover that the committee, their last recourse for appeal, consisted only of a few people sitting around a table. They felt that the proceedings should have had a more legal atmosphere. The tribunal will benefit from having that aspect, although I accept that there should be a balance between the formality of a court of law and casualness. I am sure that that balance can be achieved through regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, parents would often bring to speak for them at the appeals committee hearing a friend whom they considered to be more erudite and fluent than they and therefore more competent to present the case. However, invariably it turned out that that friend did not make the case as well as the parents. Halfway through a case, it would become clear that the parents could stand it no longer. Their child's problems and future were being discussed, and they could not sit and hear the person whom they had asked to present the case on their behalf miss the fundamentally important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important element in representation in a tribunal is the preparation of a case. Nobody speaks more from the heart about a child's problems than the parents. Legal assistance is important in that it will aid the preparation of a case beforehand, as that will help parents to speak on behalf of their children. However, I would add a rider: the tribunals must not develop into courtroom scenarios. I hope that the regulations will prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and important debate. The Committee has expressed a wish that the appellants be able to do themselves justice. I shall highlight one or two points that arise from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal system should develop into a culture of informality under simple, straightforward and accessible regulations. As much help as possible should be extended to those who appeal. Parents who take their case to the tribunal should receive information and help from the tribunal. I was about to say that they should also receive encouragement. However, that is inappropriate, because the tribunal must be impartial. The process should be made as easy as possible for parents. I echo the sentiments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1195</span>
of the hon. Member for Wallsend. It is important that parents are not daunted when they consider whether to appeal. I do not support what the hon. Member for Wallsend said about legal aid for advice. Advice is important in such proceedings. The hon. Member for Wallsend used regulations to justify representation in court. However, some of the regulations that are most important to the appellant refer to what takes place before the case arrives at court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 160(2)(g) confers some important rights—those of discovery and inspection—on parents. They will need legal advice about those rights when they prepare their case. It is important for parents to obtain the documents and relevant material that is in the hands of the local authority. Parents may not know what the local authority possesses before they decide to appeal. They should know about everything that is relevant to their child's case. Parents require advice and assistance about such matters. That is why I support a culture of help and informality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should also apply when parents arrive at the tribunal. Hon. Members spoke earlier about an adversarial system. The automatic expectation that there should be legal representation for both sides in every case would produce an adversarial tribunal. I hope that adversarial elements can be kept to a minimum. The hon. Member for Wallsend mentioned disputed facts. In cases that the tribunal will tackle, facts should be agreed. The tribunal should not have to investigate who is telling the truth. Cases that come before the tribunal will be sensitive. Conflict and bad feeling should be avoided as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that spirit, I made my earlier remarks about the chairmen of tribunals. A chairman should act in accordance with broad legal principles. He should also be practical. A chairman may be expected to do more than a judge, and assume an inquisitorial function to ascertain the facts. Chairmen should, therefore, be active in highlighting all the issues and doing justice to the parties, while remaining impartial. That will require some skill. I hope that chairmen will be skillful and about to preserve the informality of the tribunal. The tribunal should not lose its informality and become a legally hide-bound forum for conflict between different sets of legal representatives. I hope that the tribunal will operate in a practical, humane way and will avoid unnecessary legalism. There is a distinction between legalistic and legal. It should not be legalistic and the legal process should be kept to a minimum. If the tribunal develops in that way, it will be accessible and will provide justice between the parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting, urbane debate on an important topic. The Committee will not be surprised to know that I am minded to advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, which was so seductively moved by the hon. Member for Wallsend. He put his case moderately, so I owe him a full response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am impressed by the arguments of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere gave us the benefit of his experience as a lawyer, my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest, who crossed swords with me this morning because of his enthusiasm for the non-legal nature of the proceedings, reinforced his argument to great
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1196</span>
effect this afternoon, and my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) put an interesting perspective on the people who went to her appeals committee and the kind of help that they required. They all put the case eloquently for minimal legalism in the proceedings. The hon. Member for Hyndburn, in a thoughtful contribution, was inclined to the other side of the argument, but at least he acknowledged that the process should not be cluttered with more legalism than is absolutely necessary. Indeed, that was the whole tenor of this morning's discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall encapsulate the argument in favour of the amendment by referring to a story told by a rather cynical Frenchman before the fall of the Berlin wall. He said that he loved Germany so much that he wanted to have two of them. The hon. Member for Wallsend is so keen on lawyers that he wants not just one, but at least three with a supporting cast of solicitors. Fundamentally, that is why I am unable to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point, but will he consider including a provision in the regulations to require a local authority to notify the tribunal before the hearing date of its intention to be legally represented, so that legal aid could be provided to parents to allow them to be legally represented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an ingenious suggestion. I am not minded to extend the power generally, but I am interested that the hon. Gentleman has confined the matter to a narrow field. My officials will have heard his suggestion, so perhaps we can consider it at greater leisure but without any commitment at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a case for a legal chairman to hold the legal umbrella—as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere suggested—because it is a legal procedure, but without automatic recourse to legal representation by the parties. Whether or not legal aid is payable, the overwhelming view of the Committee is that we should try to keep things as simple and as friendly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to resist the hon. Gentleman's line of argument for three reasons. First, alongside the phrase that became current on the Committee before I joined it—chaos and confusion—I would put another two words beginning with C—cost and complication. I should not like cost to be a major part of my argument in resisting the amendment, but it is a consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been acknowledged—in particular, by the hon. Member for Hyndburn—the proposal would enable parents to apply for green form legal aid. Indeed, it would not preclude them from applying for legal aid on an appeal on a point of law in a decision of the tribunal to the High Court. However, it is not our intention to provide legal aid at the tribunal hearing for the reason which I have already mentioned and shall return to when I explicate the safeguards for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the cost of the green form scheme has been calculated at a rather precise figure of £41,000 per annum. That is not a large sum; but, plainly, for parents who have no other recourse, it is useful to be able to go to a solicitor to determine, in effect, whether they have a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, suppose that we extended the power at large. We should bear in mind the theme that I touched on this morning about what I called an arms race in the legal profession, in which everyone would have to be even more or equivalently represented. We could reach a point where the cost would probably increase by several hundred thousand pounds. That is my advice. As the Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1197</span>
may recall, this morning I suggested that the overall cost to the tribunal would be millions of pounds per annum. If recourse to the tribunal grew and if the legal emphasis increased, the tribunal's running costs might well double—not necessarily to the great advantage of the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. If a local authority turns up at the tribunal and is legally represented and the parents turn up on their own, because of their financial circumstances, would he describe the parents as under-represented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman in a moment because I want to return to what might be termed parity of representation since that seems to be the cause of an important anxiety across the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned cost and complication. I now leave cost on one side. Complication is perhaps a more serious concern. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, the lawyer 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have them; I could not do without them. My hon. Friend was worried that the amendment would create formality and complication. If such a course were were followed, the tribunal might find that many hearings tended to turn on arguments between lawyers about points of law rather than on the expression of the case and the local authority's response to it. It is almost inevitable that what began with the best of intentions as a friendly and quick means of resolving disputes might turn into a vehicle for protracted legal warfare. That is my first argument for resisting the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is the question of precedent. The hon. Member for Wallsend did some clear staff work. His suggestions about those cases where there is recourse to legal aid for tribunal work are more or less consistent with my advice. They do not add up, however, to an argument for extending legal aid in this instance. The hon. Gentleman knows, as do many members of the Committee with experience elsewhere will know, that for cases before the vast majority of tribunals—not just the agricultural lands tribunal that I mentioned this morning or the milk quota tribunal but, above all, industrial tribunals—legal aid is not available. Therefore, it is by no means the norm for legal aid to be available for cases before tribunals. One reason may be the considerations that I have already mentioned. However, it is available in some instances, such as cases before Lands Tribunal, as the hon. Member for Wallsend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of what might be termed a subordinate body and I regarded the Lands Tribunal as something that batted in the big league and considered complicated cases, involving large sums of money and, almost inevitably, points of law. That was not quite the league in which I expected to perform. As I recall it—this may add light relief—the only time I had heard the words "Lands Tribunal" related to my personal interest when we had to value my late father's estate for probate and there was a row about the value of a ram. To this day, I remember my valuer put the ram's worth at £16, but the district valuer wanted £20. With a degree of precision and what I thought was a knock-down case, my valuer argued, "What on earth is the use of a ram in April?" Those hon. Members who understand the agricultural cycle will see the point of that remark. Despite that slight, I asked the valuer what I should do. He said that the only possible recourse I had on a dispute about £4 was to go to the Lands Tribunal. He
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1198</span>
said, "So, drop it Boswell" I did. I make that point because the Lands Tribunal is a highly technical, specialist body that is far different from that established in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend also correctly pointed out that legal aid is available at the mental health review tribunals because of the special circumstances involved. A parent is not, typically, the advocate for the person involved because it is his or her mental disability that is in question. The case can also hinge on matters of law, public safety and other considerations. That analogy is not appropriate either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend also cited the case of the employment appeals tribunal. He will know that that tribunal is equivalent to a High court because it hears appeals from industrial tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not been the general practice to provide legal aid for the type of tribunal hearings for which the Bill provides. Precedent is on our side in arguing against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that a clear distinction can be made between those tribunals, such as industrial tribunals and its appeal body, the employment appeals tribunal, and the Lands Tribunal and its subsidiary body, the agricultural lands tribunal, and the special education needs tribunal to which there is no superior court of appeal? There is a compelling argument that enables us to distinguish between the cases to which the Minister has referred and that of the special education needs tribunal, which does not have a set up in which to hear appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an ingenious point, but the High Court will be behind the special education needs tribunal to consider points of law. We may want to differ about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about the type of recourse and support for parents that are available, about which I know, without exception members of the Committee are worried. I still prefer—most of the Committee would—an approach that is as informal and as user-friendly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend suggested that LEAs should be able to serve prior notice of what I might term an escalation in the arms race or a declaration of conditions of war if it decided to call in lawyers. That is an ingenious idea that bears reflection. However, the regulations, which will be available for consultation in the light of the debates, will contain a form of words that is at least as strong as that in the regulations applying to industrial tribunals. Regulation 8(1) of the Industrial Tribunals (Rules of Procedure) Regulations 1984 has the general instruction that
	<br><q><p>"The tribunal shall conduct the hearing in such manner as it considers most suitable to the clarification of the issues before it and generally to the just handling of the procedures; it shall so far as appears to it appropriate seek to avoid formality in its proceedings".</p></q>
We shall do at least as well, if not better than that. I am attracted by the idea and intend to instruct officials to talk to the local authority associations to discover whether there could be a voluntary agreement that a local authority will not field a lawyer when a parent does not have legal representation. That throws the onus of the argument in the opposite direction to that suggested by the hon. Gentleman, and gives a parent the chance to express a preference for such a hearing, if not an implied right of veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what may happen at a tribunal whether or not other parties were legally represented or insisted on being so. I want to emphasise that if parents make an approach to the tribunal, they will not be left bereft, even if they have no other help. Parents who apply to the tribunal will receive a clear guide explaining in straightforward language exactly what will happen. As I have already reminded the Committee, our Department holds crystal awards for clarity and we intend to do our best on this occasion. The staff before the hearing and the tribunal members during the hearing will do all in their power to put parents at ease. That is essential if there are to be proper hearings and is fair, in view of the strongly expressed arguments made in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that parents may bring befrienders, family friends or people acting as advocates to speak on their behalf, as is the case with other tribunals. Some of those people may be—in cases of disability hearings are likely to be—professionally qualified, perhaps in the law. They may be representatives or employees of organisations for the disabled which are bringing forward cases on behalf of distressed parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash about whether parents best make their own case. I have considerable sympathy with it, but there will be cases in which someone should speak on parents' behalf, if only to maintain their morale. That will not be discouraged and is perfectly proper. Any parent or party to the proceedings will have the right to bring their lawyer if they wish. The argument is not about rights of audience, but whether the cost should be met by public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be much better for the tribunal to start on the basis that I have described. There are arguments against providing legal aid for all the parties to the tribunal for the reasons that I have stated. I shall invite my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with such a debate is that the more one listens, the more one thinks of questions. My hon. Friend said that he will consult with his officials about taking forward some of the points that have been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following what will, one hopes, be the informal proceedings of a user-friendly tribunal, there will be the opportunity to take legal points to the High Court. I am worried that few parents who had been through the process would know whether there was a case to be considered. Is there a case for someone checking the record of the proceedings if parents are worried? They could say, "Yes, there might be a case to be looked at". A duty solicitor performs a similar function in other types of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek an immediate response, but my hon. Friend may examine this point when he further considers these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that constructive suggestion. We shall examine it as we progress to regulations, but shall not make any commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I owe the hon. Member for Wallsend a concluding point. As I said—as I hope to have convinced my hon. Friends—there are arguments against the amendment. I always think that it is a good idea to study what happens.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1200</span>
Ideally—as people who have experience of legislation know—we should not continually change things according to how we feel about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no reason to think that we shall want to change the Bill. Indeed, I think that the Committee would regret it, if it prescribed legal aid in such circumstances. If the hon. Gentleman's example were to arise, which I do not anticipate, in the tribunal's operations in future years, he should remember that if there is a proposal to extend civil legal aid to tribunal work, powers already exist under part IV of the Legal Aid Act 1988 for that to happen. It states:
	<br><q><p>"This part applies to such proceedings before courts or tribunals or at statutory inquiries … being specified in Part I of Schedule 2 of this Act".</p></q>
It excludes proceedings described in section 2 of the schedule and proceedings for which criminal legal aid may be granted, under part V. Section 14 also enables section 2 to be varied by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor, to extend or restrict the categories of proceedings described, but, the regulations cannot be made without the consent of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were thought to be sensible and appropriate to extend legal aid, it would be possible to do so through that route. I hope that it is a little aid and comfort that I can give the hon. Member for Wallsend. I feel strongly that the case for legal re-armament, which is implicit in his proposal—well conceived and presented as it was—is not made. I invite my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response to the amendment, which has been helpful and constructive, as has the debate. If we did not have the situation laid down in the Bill by the Government and then an amendment from the Opposition, but instead had a blank piece of paper, I am sure that the Committee could have produced something even more appropriate than what is before us this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responded constructively. The Committee does not want parents to be under-represented: it wants them to have parity of representation with the respondent in a tribunal hearing. If we progress on that basis, many of the Minister's comments will be helpful in ensuring that shared objective. I do not want to divide the Committee on this issue and I shall beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Line 20 of the clause states:

We have discussed the rights of parents to have a solicitor and spoken of law, without legal assistance, the less articulate and less wealthy will be disadvantaged. From experience, I subscribe to that view. However, an equally important issue has arisen from the debate. Parents need, at least, the help and advice of an educational psychologist at such a tribunal. The clause does not preclude that from the Bill, but I wonder whether such a facility could be included in the regulations to allow parents to have the right of the help of an educational psychologist from an LEA, or privately—a private psychologist might be very expensive, and the local educational psychologist probably made the original recommendation in the statement. Parents need the expert and professional advice of an educational psychologist when presenting their case. Those who are less articulate and less wealthy will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1201</span>
greatly disadvantaged if they do not have access to such advice. Will the Minister consider including provision for that in the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Porter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Waveney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause covers regulations for user-friendly tribunal proceedings. Subsection (2) deals with which tribunal is to hear an appeal, with transferring proceedings from one tribunal to another, with granting inspection of document rights, with persons being required to give evidence and with awards of costs and expenses. I am worried about the distances involved in travelling to achieve that for people who are, in the words of my hon. Friend the Minister and other hon. Members, often vulnerable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister said this morning that travel expenses will be paid to appellants. Mention was made of Cambridge as a regional centre for East Anglia. Cambridge is not in East Anglia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way because that is a very sore point with my constituents. There is doubt about exactly where Cambridge is located—although I recall going to university there—and about the boundaries of East Anglia. However, there is no doubt that the centre and capital of East Anglia is Norwich. I think that I know where my hon. Friend's argument is leading and I am more than happy to support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right: East Anglia is Suffolk and Norfolk. I always cite as evidence for that the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Bill, which was the first Bill that I debated in Committee when I came to the House in 1987. In East Anglia, if we regard anywhere as a regional centre, we look to Norwich, or possibly Ipswich, but certainly not Cambridge. I say that without wishing to offend the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second, and more serious, point is about the location of the tribunals on a regional basis. If Cambridge is chosen for my area, that means a journey of 80 miles. There is no direct rail link and more than half the roads are inadequate, to put it kindly. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say more about that aspect of the tribunals? As we have said, appearances before them will be traumatic, inconvenient and tiring, but just getting to them will be all those things and very expensive to boot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I want to speak briefly to the point raised helpfully by the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg), which brings me back to a point that I made earlier. Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's objective, I wish to draw to the attention of the Committee a danger that might arise. If parties to the tribunals take with them witnesses, such as educational psychologists, the other side will inevitably want to do the same and so the proceedings will become protracted. That is not to say that parents should not have such assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked earlier about the need for agreement. If the regulations focused on that, both sides could agree on, for example, an expert report from an educational psychologist. Without agreement, the adversarial techniques of the courtroom will prevail, in which one side, briefed by its witnesses, cross-examines the other side's witnesses and the tribunal has to decide which expert witnesses are most impressive. It would be helpful if the regulations could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1202</span>
bear that in mind and if as much as possible could be agreed in advance. The most important thing at the tribunals is surely for parents to be able to tell their story, feeling as uninhibited as possible and without the cross-examination of witnesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that was a useful short debate. Perhaps I may conclude on a geographical point. As we ended this morning's sitting on the subject of the Principality, may I now turn to East Anglia? Here, too, I have certain amount of past form in that I was born in Essex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essex man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that would be said. I remember that long ago there was a debate about what was called in broad Essex "the sheres", which was anywhere outside Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. I am conscious that at the time, no one in Suffolk or Norfolk would admit paternity for us. It is a sensitive subject, but so as not to add to the sensitivity, I shall not try to open a gap between Suffolk and Norfolk—except to commend my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter) for mentioning the huge distances that would have to be travelled to Cambridge if it became the regional centre. Coming from the south-west parish of Northamptonshire, which is also governed by Cambridge for certain purposes—we are nearly 75 miles in the other direction—I must admit to having some sensitivity to my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My tribunal experience was always at a closer remove—usually considerably so. It is clear that an early duty of the tribunal secretariat will be to go out looking for suitable centres at which to hold tribunals. So my hon. Friend's point was of value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for City of Durham and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere mentioned representation on the tribunal. We do not envisage the regulations conveying any right of attendance because it is not their function to specify the people who may turn up. Conversely, there is no suggestion of our confining or preventing such people from doing so—indeed, it may be desirable in some instances. It would be possible for an education psychologist to go along as the friend of the appellant parents, or to be an expert witness. My experience is that tribunals are usually flexible about how best that can be done. We are not seeking to shut anyone out. That was an interesting suggestion from my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about an advance pact on how this might be handled. As we have not tabled an amendment to this effect, I do not think that we may amend regulations or provide for specific regulations along those lines. However, the spirit of the point is well taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recognise that the important evidence in the statementing procedure as regards the local education authority is the appendix C written by the education psychologist. It is powerful avidence, especially in relation to education placements. If a parent is challenging the statementing procedure through the LEA and there is a direct challenge to the psychologist's evidence, nmight the parent be allowed a second opinion, as happens in the medical profession? Is the Minister prepared to look into such a possibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The whole thrust of the regulations is that they are designed to be general, and providing, not to exclude reasonable representation, but—for reasons already discussed—not either, to lead to an escalation of the nature of the event. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, who spoke so eloquently, I believe that in many instances, although not on technical points, parents are their own and their child's best advocate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should explain to the Committee what on earth is going on.—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I apologise for the large number of Government amendments and new clauses in this group, and I hope that the Committee will understand when I explain that it is the result of paragraph 9.7 of the White Paper published in the middle of last year, which states:
	<br><q><p>"All LEA maintained special schools will come under schemes of local management from April 1994. They will be funded on a formula basis and some of them will have delegated management. The Government believes it is in principle right that, once special schools have delegated management, they should be given the choice to ballot their parents on the case for GM status. The legislation will be extended to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to permit such applications for GM status for special schools. Before the Secretary of State makes such regulations he will wish to be satisfied that there is a fair and effective basis for funding GM special schools."</p></q>
We were unable to include those provisions in the original draft of the Bill, as we intended, because they turned out to be more complex and numerous than we thought. All the new clauses and amendments are interdependent and arise from the Government's desire to include in the Bill a mechanism by which special schools may become grant-maintained if parents so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain in some detail the effects of the amendments and new clauses. They will enable the Secretary of State to approve the transfer of existing LEA-maintained special schools into the grant-maintained sector. They will also enable the funding agency for schools, after the 10 per cent. entry point has been reached, to create and reorganise new grant-maintained special schools. In devising procedures for the latter, we are also taking the opportunity to harmonise them with the equivalent procedures for the establishment and reorganisation of maintained special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, arrangements governing the discontinuance of LEA-maintained special schools are as set out in clause
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1204</span>
166, which requires LEAs to serve notice of their proposals on defined categories of person—the Secretary of State, the appropriate Further Education Funding Council, the parent of every registered pupil at the school, any other LEA that has arranged for special educational provision to be made at the school for a child who lives in its area, and any other persons whom the authority considers appropriate. A minimum of two months must then be allowed for objections to be submitted to the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements have worked well in practice. Hitherto, they have been limited to the closure of a maintained special school, although there has been a clear expectation that consultation should precede opening and alteration as well. In future, the funding agency for schools will be able to set up a grant-maintained special school. Therefore, it is important that there should be a consistent regime across the grant-maintained and LEA sectors governing the establishment, alteration and closure of special schools. That regime should ensure thorough and substantial consultation without imposing an unduly heavy burden on LEAs or the funding agency for schools. That is why the clause 166 regime of consultation on statutory proposals has been chosen for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall improve the regime governing LEA maintained special schools at the same time as we introduce grant-maintained special schools. Consistent arrangements will apply across the board. New clauses 27, 28, 29 and 31 will effect that. They will also cover the provisions of clauses 162 and 166 to 168, which I shall delete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 27 defines special schools as schools that are specially organised to provide for special educational needs and are approved by the Secretary of State under the provisions of new clause 31. It replaces, with similar terms, section 9(5) of the Education Act 1944. It provides for special schools that are set up by the funding agency for schools, or converted from LEA-maintained to grant-maintained status, to be called "grant-maintained special schools".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 28 deals with the establishment, alteration and discontinuance of maintained and grant-maintained special schools. It empowers the FAS, from stage two, to establish special schools. It requires the FAS and any LEA that intends to establish, alter or discontinue a special school to serve notice of such proposals to the Secretary of State and other persons who are prescribed in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governing body of a grant-maintained school that intends to alter or discontinue a school is similarly required to serve notice of its proposals. The new clause provides for the incorporation of the governing body and allows the Secretary of State to apply the Bill's provisions for the establishment of grant-maintained schools with or without modification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 29 deals with the procedures for tackling proposals. The ground is broadly familiar. Before settling and serving notice of their proposals the LEA or FAS, as guided by the Secretary of State will consult interested parties, such as the LEA or FAS as appropriate, neighbouring LEAs, the FEFC where appropriate, voluntary bodies, social services departments and district health authorities. Those bodies constitute the minimum number of groups to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Health trusts would also have to be consulted in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1205</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without wishing to commit my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office, that point also covers England. I am giving an example of the bodies that I believe the Secretary of State would include in his guidance. I have mentioned only the minimum. I am happy to receive suggestions such as that of the hon. Member for Bridgend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 29 provides a right of objection, which may be exercised in the period set out in the notice, which is not less than two months. It also provides for the authority that served the notice to give to the Secretary of State copies of their objections and any observations about them. He can reject, approve without modification, or, after consulting the authority, approve modified proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 31 replaces clause 162, which deals with approval of special schools, to reflect the changes that I have described. It provides for the Secretary of State to approve non-maintained special schools. It includes existing special schools and those established under the new procedures in the approval process. The regulations that impose continuing requirements and withdrawal of approval will, therefore, continue to apply. The new clause also sets out requirements for special school pupils to receive religious education and attend religious worship. It also requires the FAS or governing body to serve notice of proposals to close the school if the Secretary of State withdraws his approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now consider a LEA-maintained school that wishes to become grant maintained. With the possible exception of LEA-maintained hospital schools, the transition will be subject to the same balloting regime that applies to an ordinary school that wishes to become grant maintained. In all cases, governing bodies will be required to publish statutory proposals. They will have the same right of objection as ordinary schools. New clause 30 sets out the necessary provision. It is right that such arrangements should apply when a fundamental move from one authority to another is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 30 deals with maintained special schools that become grant maintained. It empowers the Secretary of State, by regulations, to make provision for any maintained special school to cease to be maintained by the LEA and to become grant maintained. The clause requires regulations to be made governing the submission and approval of proposals to acquire grant-maintained status. It provides for a governing body to be incorporated under the provisions set out in the new schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations applying, with or without modification, to certain other provisions of the Bill, as appropriate: to chapters two and three of part II, which deal with procedures for the acquisition of grant-maintained status and with transfers of property, staff and contracts; to new clause 29, on procedures for dealing with proposals, and to section 231, which deals with the relationship between applications for grant-maintained status and other proposals affecting the school concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses are, as I have said, tabled on the basis that clauses 162, 166, 167 and 168 will be deleted. I shall remind the Committee of what those clauses cover. Clause 162 would govern the approval of special schools, and empower the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the requirements to be complied with by special schools and it deals with the withdrawal of approval where they are not observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1206</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 166 to 168 govern the procedure for the discontinuance of a maintained special school by the local education authority. Clause 166 would require an LEA intending to cease to maintain a special school to serve notice on the Secretary of State, the further education funding council, parents of registered pupils, other LEAs with children at the school and whoever else it might consider appropriate. Clause 167 would provide for a statutory right of objection and clause 168 would empower the Secretary of State to reject, approve or approve with modification such proposals. It would also provide that the LEA must act upon any approval by the Secretary of State. Those clauses should, I believe, be deleted, and replaced by the new clauses and amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new schedule, Government amendment No. 702, is about the government and conduct of grant-maintained special schools. It sets out the detailed provisions for the constitution of the governing body and the conduct of the school, for initial and subsequent instruments and articles of government and for the replacement of first governors if the school gets into difficulties. This is all familiar ground from previous debate on other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new schedule also contains an important provision headed "General application of enactments". That allows the putting into effect, with or without modification, of any provision of schedules 5 and 6 which, the Committee will recall, relate to governing bodies and articles of government of grant-maintained schools, and chapters six, eight and 10 of part II, which relate to the funding of grant-maintained schools, their winding up, disposal of assets and miscellaneous provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 53 other small, but necessary, amendments, all of which are essentially consequential. Many of them simply substitute the words, "make" or "made" for "publish" or "published" in order that the appropriate references are made to the separate proposal regimes that I described earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining amendments are similarly technical. None raises any issue of substance that the Committee would want me to discuss now. The amendments are necessarily detailed and it would help, I think, if I took a little longer to explain briefly how we envisage the measure working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not introduce regulations enabling maintained special schools to obtain grant-maintained status until we have a firm basis for funding—in other words until the funding agency for schools is established and the local management of special schools is in place. That suggests that regulations will be in force from April 1994. In envisaging grant-maintained status for special schools, we do not exclude those established in hospitals, but we will need further to consider regulations for their special circumstances. Therefore, not all that I shall say next can be taken as applying equally to the important category of hospital schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee, I shall repeat what I said more slowly. The great advantage of reading a speech is that one can recapture one's words, which is not always possible. We shall not introduce regulations enabling grant-maintained status for maintained special schools until we have a firm basis for funding: in other words, not until the funding agency for schools is established and local management of special schools is in place. So there are two necessary preconditions before the procedure can go ahead. Regulations should be in force enabling the process to take place from April 1994. That is the earliest date at which it could proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding agency could be up and running and local management of special schools could be in place by 1994, but surely the Minister will not contemplate establishing grant-maintained special schools before local management of special schools has been up and running for a couple of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not necessarily the case. We must have the mechanism in place, but I do not think that a pilot scheme or a running-in period is necessary, as the hon. Gentleman suggests. It will be sufficient for the local management of special schools regime to have been introduced and established so that special schools contemplating grant-maintained status will at least be aware of the basis on which the funding might be arranged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we clarify the time scale. Local management of special schools will be in place from April 1994. Is the Minister telling us that special schools will not be able to apply to be grant-maintained special schools until each school has had experience of local management of schools, or will some special schools, instead of being under the local management of special schools system, go straight to grant-maintained special school status from April 1994? Will the regulations be introduced at that point but implemented at a later date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reminded that special schools will have to have schemes in place by April 1994 in any case. The LMSS schemes will be in existence from April 1994, so both conditions will have been fulfilled. That will be the model on which the funding of schools that ballot to become grant-maintained will be based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that special schools will have to have schemes from April 1994. But the fact that they have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1208</span>
drawn up a scheme does not mean that those schools will have had experience of LMSS because it will only have been in place from April 1994. Will it be necessary for a special school to have experience of LMSS before it becomes a grant-maintained special school? Can it become a grant-maintained special school from April 1994, or is it that when it will get the experience that will lead to grant-maintained special school status later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It will be entitled to consider grant-maintained status and to initiate the procedure from April 1994. The hon. Lady is making a similar point to that of her hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). We do not envisage the necessity for a school to run the LMSS scheme for a period before it can contemplate grant-maintained special school status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the earliest date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, from April 1994 schools could initiate the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Initiate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. They would do so according to whether they felt that they were confident enough about the LMSS scheme to be satisfied that it would provide a reasonable basis for financing. I realise what Opposition Members of the Committee seek, but the safeguard would be the parents' and governors' judgment about whether they knew enough about the financial regime to go ahead with confidence to grant-maintained status. It would have to be left to them. I do not envisage a mandatory transitional period stretching beyond April 1994 before grant-maintained status for special schools could be contemplated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the Minister consider further amending the legislation, requiring reference to be made to a management plan as part of the proposal for grant-maintained status? That would demonstrate that the governing body had considered the financial procedures and processes that will have to be adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is probably a keen environmentalist who believes in recycling. Ingeniously, he included that proposal in a previous amendment. Such a management plan would not be necessary in a case such as the one that we are discussing for the reasons which I stated previously. In considering a proposal made by a special school under the provisions, the Secretary of State would want to satisfy himself that the provisions for the school's management and viability gave him the confidence to agree to the proposal. He would judge whether the necessary procedures and mechanisms were in place. We would arrive at the same destination after using a slightly different route. I would hold back from inserting a formal requirement of the kind suggested twice by the hon. Gentleman into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all of my remarks will necessarily apply to hospital special schools, although we do not want to exclude them from grant-maintained status. After 1 April 1994, the funding agency for schools will be able to establish a grant-maintained special school and a LEA-maintained special school will be able to ballot parents on grant-maintained status. Assuming a positive outcome from the ballots, proposals will have to be made to the Secretary of State. There will be procedures for and a statutory time scale governing objection to proposals, just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1209</span>
as for ordinary grant-maintained schools. The Secretary of State would make his decision in broadly similar fashion as for ordinary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a proposal is approved, a governing body will be constituted for the grant-maintained special school in accordance with instruments and articles made under the new schedule. The regime will work in broadly the same way as for ordinary grant-maintained schools, with provision for the same categories of governor, including sponsor governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recognition of the typically small size of special schools, the schedule provides for the same flexibility of governing body size as presently applies in the case of small grant-maintained schools. There will be a provision for
	<br><q><p>"not less than three nor more than five parent governors."</p></q>
We are similarly providing that at least two of the first governors will have experience of special education in the broadest sense. They might be SEN professionals, parents of children with SEN or people who have had special needs. In recognition of the particular nature of hospital special schools, we are providing for the appointment of parent governors by the other governors and, where it is not practicable to appoint parent governors who have children at the school, that the parent of any child of school age may be appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of an ordinary grant-maintained school's governing body are set out in clause 60. The new schedule enables the Secretary of State to modify them as necessary for special schools, but in practice we envisage similar arrangements applying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The payment of grants to grant-maintained special schools will be done by the FAS. As for ordinary grant-maintained schools, it will handle the payment of both recurrent and capital grant for grant-maintained special schools. We envisage that annual maintenance grants will be calculated in a way which reflects the relevant LEA funding under LMSS, with provision as necessary for central additions to be determined by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of admissions, a grant-maintained special school will present itself to the home authority and to neighbouring authorities as a school ready to accept pupils with special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I listen to the Minister, various thoughts go through my head. I shall share one with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when a local authority has developed a great deal of integrated provision? Will those schools apply for grant-maintained status as grant-maintained schools, will they apply because they have many children with statements of special educational need, or do they apply to become grant-maintained special schools? How will they fit into the scheme of things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on the category into which they fell. If the school was a mainstream school with significant special needs provision, the procedures governing consideration of grant-maintained status would be those for ordinary schools. If it was deemed to be a special school, it would be covered by the procedures that I am describing. Every school has to fall into one category or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1210</span>
I was talking about admissions. Parents will of course be able to express a preference for their child to attend a grant-maintained special school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same provisions for regular inspection will apply to a grant-maintained special school as apply to any other maintained special school. They will be subject to a four-year cycle of inspection, and we intend to table further amendments to part V for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also goes without saying that the national curriculum provisions will apply to pupils in grant-maintained special schools as they do to pupils in LEA-maintained special schools, though any grant-maintained hospital special school would continue to be excepted from the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any proposals by the governors or the funding agency for schools for the alteration or discontinuance of a grant-maintained special school would come within the scope of the arrangements set out in the new clauses that I have described. There is provision for the Secretary of State to prescribe the alterations, which would require the making of such proposals. We envisage imposing similar requirements to those currently in force in respect of LEA special schools. In other words, changes to numbers of pupils, the categories of their disabilities, age range, sex, and the nature of the SEN provision in question will continue to require proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of discontinuance of a grant-maintained special school, we envisage that the arrangements for winding up and disposal which are set out in respect of ordinary grant-maintained schools in clauses 99 to 104 will, in the main, apply in equal measure. When the Secretary of State has approved proposals for discontinuance and given notice specifying a date on which the funding agency's duty to maintain the school will cease, he will be empowered to make an order for the winding up of the governing body and disposal of the school property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I apologise for the length and the speed at which I have made my comments. I have tried to give the Committee a full explanation of what is behind the amendents and new clauses that I have tabled and how I envisage those important procedures working. They are based on the presumption, to which I referred at the beginning of my speech and which is in the White Paper. It is desirable to allow the facilitation of grant-maintained status for special schools through the procedures that I have described and which are akin to those for ordinary schools, if they decide to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the new clauses find favour with the Committee and that they will be approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that we cannot give the proposals even a qualified welcome. They are flawed in principle. One of the major problems that we foresee with such a new regime is that the Government's other declared policy to encourage integration, as far as possible, will be held up and damaged by this move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems will be created by encouraging schools to remain separate. In cases in which the local authority is seeking to develop a policy of integration, many schools will not take part in a general debate on the quality and implementation of alternative provision, but they will decide to ignore the alternative and apply for grant-maintained special school status. If Government policy is to encourage the effective and appropriate integration of children with special needs as fully as possible into a mainstream site, will the Government

consider such cases on their merits or will they always prefer the alternative, by which a school becomes a grant-maintained special school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two clear choices to be made, but the history of the effort to achieve greater integration shows that the first reaction is one of fear. People ask, "Things seem to be working well, so why change?" An LEA's moves to encourage more integration are likely, on balance, to be thwarted by schools deciding to opt for grant-maintained special school status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jaqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a similar discussion before, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman realises that good special schools do not wish to challenge the policy of integration. They believe that their function lies alongside that policy, so that children who need the treatment that special schools supply can get it and thus be more prepared to cope with a mainstream school. Good special schools consider that to be a means of opting in and out as the child requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Lady's argument, but it does not apply as a one-off consideration all the time. Integration can provide a better environment than even a good special school. A special school should not always be separate just because its provision is good. If it could be shown that integration would improve the provision—and that there are sufficient resources, in terms of both staff and finance—I would support that integration. The possibility of creating grant-maintained special schools is likely to act as a brake on the policy of integration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a further problem with integration is that the good special school will have links with the mainstream school system, as the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye noted? Members of staff may often be based at a good special school and work not just in that school, but in many maintained schools. If the school becomes grant maintained, the employment arrangements for those members of staff become very muddy and might break down further that integration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. We recalled aspects of that question when we discussed integration earlier. Peripatetic staff can operate at the school and at other schools, providing a learning support service outside the school to which they are attached so that the local authority can record their existence and pay them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, problems relating to equipment in special schools can arise. The LEA's equipment in a special school can be used also in other schools within the authority if, for example, a pupil for whom special equipment was installed leaves the school, but another pupil in another school requires the same equipment. The problems of equipment that a school has permanently and of that which can be shared with other schools must be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will grant-maintained special schools encourage or discourage integration? I think that they are likely to discourage it. Given that the change is considerable, we must ask who wants it to happen. The Minister referred to the commitments to grant-maintained special schools in the White Paper, "Choice and Diversity". No one who is heavily involved in the special education sector has said to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1212</span>
me that he or she was disappointed that the Government did not bring forward more detailed legislation on the creation of grant-maintained special schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but practically every special school that used to belong to the inner London boroughs are desperate to become grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, how many special schools or voluntary organisations that run special schools or are heavily involved in helping to provide for children with special educational needs responded to the White Paper by welcoming the proposals and said that they wanted grant-maintained special schools to be created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. This is an enabling provision that allows schools to make their own decisions. If no special school wants to become grant maintained, none will become so. The hon. Gentleman can relax and need not be so worried. The people in a special school that I visited recently expressed a strong interest in grant-maintained status. Although I perhaps do not go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye, a significant number of special schools are interested in such a possibility and I can enable them to put that into practice if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister is trying to drum up support for the proposal from somewhere. My question was, how many people who responded to "Choice and Diversity" welcomed the proposal to create grant-maintained special schools? I have talked to many people in the grant-maintained sector and none admitted to supporting the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, they do not have to become grant-maintained special schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the Minister claims that "Choice and Diversity" is a response to a demand. I say that no such demand was expressed as a response to the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I said that. It is possible to say in a White Paper, "In response to popular demand, we shall do so and so." In this instance, it is a case of saying, "Given that we believe that grant-maintained status will benefit some schools if they decide on it, is there any reason for us to exclude special schools?" It is that which has driven us in this direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says specifically that it is a matter of the Government's education dogma. Someone who is greatly involved in special educational needs told me that the proposal was the result of dogmatism, and that it would do nothing whatever to help to improve the standard of special education, or integration. He, too, thought that it was a measure that was likely to encourage segregation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only evidence of support for the measure that I found was the representation made to the Department of Education by the former right hon. Member for Chingford, who is now in another place. His pleading for one large school in Waltham Forest, the name of which now escapes me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whitefield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1213</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the biggest special school in the country, I believe. It was made to meet the noble Lord's demands, and perhaps buy a quieter time during the Maastricht debate. So, apart from Lord Tebbit, I have not met anyone who looks forward to grant-maintained status, and I speak to a wide variety of people involved in teaching in schools or providing special services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say, with an air of assumed innocence, "Ah, but we are only giving people the opportunity. If they do not want to take it they do not have to." As I said at the outset, given my experience of people's reactions when proposals for integration are introduced, I know that they worry about what the alternatives might be. Sometimes because what may in itself be a good idea is not properly funded, and not only in special schools, proposals may be in disrepute. If integration is not properly funded and staffed, that idea could be in disrepute. It may help if integration is proposed when the possibility of a special school taking grant-maintained status is raised, otherwise such schools will simply decide to become grant-maintained. The Minister will find it difficult to juggle his intention to encourage integration with a measure that could delay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the hundreds of lines of closely-typed print on the amendment paper. I understand from them that the funding agency will have the power to establish new special schools. The FAS may decide to set up a special school in a local authority area. It is unlikely that a severe need is not being met and warrants a new school. The Bill will, therefore, put pressure on existing special provision and schools. It could lead to surplus places in special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister claim that, under the guidance of regulations or codes of practice, a possibility of a knock-on effect of surplus places would automatically prevent the funding agency from setting up a new special school? If the Minister were worried about choice, he would have accepted an earlier Opposition amendment to grant parents the right to name a non-maintained or independent special school in the statementing process. Instead, he has pushed those schools to one side and presented a new proposal for grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider one or two practical points about the rush to create grant-maintained special schools. The Minister believes that the funding agency for schools will exist by April 1994 and will operate in areas where the 10 per cent. threshold will have been passed, and that a fair and effective way to fund grant-maintained special schools will be established. I accept the first, but not the latter proposition. A basis for funding grant-maintained special schools may exist by April 1994, and the Minister may believe it to be fair and effective, but the factors behind funding mainstream schools and those behind funding special schools are not comparable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must have given all the print on the amendment paper a great deal of thought. He must have researched a scheme for the local management of special schools. Has he examined the pattern of funding for a particular special school over five or 10 years to ascertain whether funding has altered in different years? The needs of special schools in any specific year are difficult to predict. In the current financial year, more than one local authority found that its special needs budget was overspent by several million pounds because it did not realise at the beginning of the year the way in which the need for providing help would expand. As a backstop
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1214</span>
position, if we are to have grant-maintained special schools, the Minister ought to allow the local management of special schools scheme to run for a couple of years to ensure that it is fair and effective because of the likely differing demands—unless, of course, he can say that he has researched it thoroughly and has found that there is not much difference in the funding of schools, year by year, or in the LEA's expenditure year by year, allowing for inflation. I know of examples in which there have been major differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the clause will break on integration. As most people in the special education sector do not need that, the Government could have spent more time and money studying the way in which to improve the provision for pupils with special educational needs. From a practical point of view, the local management of special schools should have been allowed to run for at least a few years, to study the way in which the schools themselves coped with it and whether major changes needed to be made to the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 31(4)(b) refers to the "request of the proprietor". Who is the proprietor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude that we are unlikely to change the Government's mind on the clause, but it will be a break on integration. It would have been far better to have studied other ways to improve special educational provision than by introducing clauses at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with enormous pleasure that I rise to congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on tabling the amendments. I assure Opposition Members that, within days of my selection as candidate for Hastings and Rye, I met the head teacher and the head of the governors of George Rainey school in Hastings—a Lambeth boarding school—and they told me of their enormous desire to get out from under the control of Lambeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the last thing that Lambeth does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Control is the last thing that Lambeth does. I cannot even describe it as benign neglect—it is certainly neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only did that particular school wish to get out, but it had worked with the 29 other boarding schools that were once the responsibility of ILEA and had worked hard to set up their own trust. It offered pupils with special educational needs in Inner London the opportunity to get the education that they needed outside the mainstream schools. The trust also offered to pupils with emotional or behavioural difficulties—who were delicate, blind, or who had moderate learning difficulties or had complex problems, such as autism—the sort of education that the schools had previously been able to offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, will the hon. Lady tell the Committee how many children were sent to that school by Lambeth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the time the roll was full and there were 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So they were all from Lambeth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were. There are now 19, which explains my comment about neglect. Members of the Committee may recall my reference earlier in the week to the fact that a social worker recently visited the school with a child who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1215</span>
was a potential pupil from Lambeth—which would increase the roll to 20. Because George Rainey school was so concerned about the neglect by Lambeth, it had marketed itself in a proper way. A parent from Berkshire has also visited the school, so the roll may increase to 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady realise that many local authorities are trying to integrate children into mainstream schools and that the lumber of pupils in special schools is gradually reducing? It has nothing to do with neglect; it is a progressive policy that the Government have championed—one of the few progressive policies to have come from them. Lambeth has one of the worst records for integration, so the fact that it is happening there is a good sign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer lies in the fact that it is not possible to integrate all children all the time, as Baroness Warnock admitted at the National Association of Head Teachers conference in September. She added that she and her committee had been naive. We know, from the increasing number of exclusions from schools, the extent of the need of some children to have access to non-mainstream schools so that they can receive the necessary education and care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to nail the lie about inner London schools and special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw that expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will withdraw it, Sir John, but I want to set the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will explain two things to the hon. Lady. First, the Government decided to destroy the Inner London education authority, a number of whose schools were concentrated in certain areas. They then decided in a somewhat arbitrary way which authorities were to be given which of the schools that were outside their areas. All sorts of complications arose over which authority had to look after which school. I shall not mention Lambeth again in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Lady that authorities which had the majority of special schools within their borough area tried automatically to bring back children in schools outside their area to schools within it. This was done for good educational reasons, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said. I know that because I was a member of Hammersmith and Fulham council at the time. Lewisham council did the same, for proper educational reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is quite long enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is a desperate desire to ensure that special schools that show ability to manage their own affairs should not be allowed to do so. It is interesting that so many special schools have been closed. Hammersmith and Fulham authority closed Fernhurst and Pine End, Hackney are proposing to close Great Stony school and Shaftesbury House and Islington is in the pre-consultation phase of closing Coombe Hall. Lewisham was honest and said that it could not afford Grafham Grange. It is now working with the Department to turn it into a non-maintained school—which must, by definition, be an argument that Lewisham realises that there is a need for the school. At least it is honest, even it wishes to lose responsibility for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals give those schools a tremendous opportunity. I do not believe—I am sure that my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1216</span>
Friends will agree—that every child can be integrated. Indeed, I have constituency cases of parents who are desperate to get their children into special schools and away from the mainstream, which cannot cope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree that some children cannot be integrated. I doubt whether anyone on the Opposition Benches disagrees with the hon. Lady on that. However, perhaps I may again set the record straight. When Hammersmith and Fulham and other inner London authorities withdrew their support from those schools outside the inner London area, they did that partly because they could not afford it. If Hammersmith and Fulham has only 10 children at a school that is supposed to cater for 50 or 60, it is having great difficulties; that arises because the Government did not set the SSA and the capital expenditure for education at levels that allowed local authorities to support those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need only say the word "Lambeth", which probably answers that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to agree that there is still a need for special schools. If we can at least agree on that, perhaps I may move on from the opportunity that special schools have to become grant maintained and the value and benefit that they will derive from that as they will control their own affairs rather than be at the mercy of education authorities—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of her speech, the hon. Lady mentioned—	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Member's intervention. It is not the hon. Member's fault, but that of his colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was being told off, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that the school in Hastings that was run by Lambeth had 30 children in it and that the number is now down to 19. It is possible that, if the school becomes grant maintained, Lambeth will no longer be prepared to send any of its children there. Therefore, what will happen to the school if no children attend it? If the hon Lady is suggesting that the school should become grant maintained, she might actually be advocating its death sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point that an increasing number of children who are being excluded from schools will probably need special school education.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> They are being excluded because they are disrupting their mainstream schools—[HON. MEMBERS: "What?"] I am sorry, but have not Opposition Members read the consultation document and the teaching press recently about the increasing number of children being excluded from mainstream schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can go on from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Keep going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1987, the special boarding schools related to the Inner London education authority worked together to set themselves up collectively as a trust. I wish to move on to that and to reiterate and expand on my earlier suggestion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1217</span>
that it would be of value to special schools to be able to become grant-maintained as a group or a cluster, as we say in primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we may have guidance, Sir John, it might assist us if the hon. Lady could clarify the point. Was she saying children who have been excluded because of their behaviour from mainstream schools will now fill the special schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that some could benefit from education in special schools. I cannot believe for a minute that you have not read the educational press—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady must address her remarks through the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir John. It was the heat of the moment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the educational press and the conclusions that are being drawn by many head teachers about why the number of exclusions is increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to go on to the issue of clusters of grant-maintained schools. A variety of options is offered by special schools and it would make a lot of sense for them to work together and offer a complete service to all educational authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady realise that as pupil numbers begin to decrease, the unit costs of a school get higher and higher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brilliant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) for acknowledging that. If unit costs get higher and higher, LEAs will not buy the places and those schools may have to close. The hon. Lady has not dealt with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is estimated that the cumulative cost to the local authority of a child who has difficulty at school is £50,000 a year. The fees of special schools, such as the school in Hastings to which I referred, are £20,000, so that is an exceedingly good bargain even for Opposition Members who do not seem to understand basic arithmetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 7 o'clock I would like to develop the argument about clusters of grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berkshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend can carry on after 7 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can carry on after—I am really looking forward to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clusters of grant-maintained schools could offer their services to education authorities throughout the area. For instance, if the schools in and around Sussex, Surrey and Kent wished to become a cluster of grant-maintained special schools, they could offer their services to those three counties, to the London boroughs, to Hampshire, Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. That would provide a seamless education system for children with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now begin to understand what happened the other day. Is that why we choked off the charitable status special schools when the Minister refused to accept amendments that would have ensured their survival? The hon. Lady is effectively saying that we can fill those schools, especially now that we have got rid of charitable status schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1218</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a great supporter of a wide variety of educational provision. The Bill does not get rid of the non-maintained special school sector. I made the point that it should be made easier for parents to send their children to a non-maintained special school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need as wide a provision as possible to allow parents to send their child to a special boarding school if they wish. If schools formed clusters, it would providt small schools—which most special schools are—witl proper management, proper financial controls and would enable them to work out clear fee structures and costs. As the hon. Member for Bath said, they could have contract! for their teachers to teach in the LEA. It would make it much easier for grant-maintained special schools to operate in a good educational environment and thus provide the best possible education for people with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members are worried about integration. There are times when children need special schooling, and other times when they can cope in a mainstream school. Given the expertise available in special schools, this provision would allow children to benefit from being able to slip in and out of mainstream schooling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the impression that I have gained so far. If that is the case, does the hon. Lady think that schools that concentrated upon such activity would have a rather precarious existence, as many such children would be in and out of school in the course of a year? It is to be hoped that if the school was successful it would help to reintegrate children into the mainstream. Therefore, as pupils moved in and out, funding could be rather precarious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

boarding schools. I can do no better than quote Mary Warnock. Speaking at the conference of the National Association of Head Teachers—I have quoted several times from that speech—she said:
	<br><q><p>"The Warnock proposals for maladjusted (EBD) were totally inadequate even though they are numerically the second largest group. For them integration is a totally different question and the problem has grown enormously. Many children are excluded with no alternative provision, sometimes only one hour a week home tuition. Until last year LEAs had no record of exclusions. Figures now coming in show some schools reporting a 50 per cent. rise in their exclusion rate. This cannot be unconnected with league tables and the reporting of results. Some schools are going for unofficial temporary exclusions, some heads did not know how many they had excluded and many do not go back to school at all. In some children's homes 40–50 per cent. of the children are excluded from school."</p></q>
She continued:
	<br><q><p>"One member of the Warnock Committee was a child psychiatrist who insisted that the prime need of these children was to get away from home to some form of boarding school."</p></q>
Those were the words of Mary Warnock. There is no better authority to point up the ned for special boarding schools. I recommend that the Minister examine the proposals, particularly those from special boarding schools that were once LEA owned. They should band together in a cluster and become grant-maintained, thereby making available the full range of special educational needs provision to the children of London and the home counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to add to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, which he made before the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye spoke. I tried to intervene on the hon. Lady and, like many of my hon. Friends, singularly failed to do so. She made interesting points about boarding schools for special needs children which I shall not comment on. However, it is important to refute one remark that she made. Several decades ago, there was an assumption in teaching that special needs children were naughty and naughty children had special needs. The holding of that belief in my profession severely damaged the education chances of my generation, that which preceded those children who are in special schools. Perhaps the hon. Lady did not intend to make such a statement, but I assure her that that is what she said, which she will see if she reads 	<i>Hansard.</i> The progress which my profession and politicians have made over past decades has led us to realise that special needs children are often of the highest intelligence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Bad behaviour or disillusionment with education are no indication of a child's intelligence or potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Lady for not giving way to her, but I felt that I had been on my feet for a long time and that other hon. Members may wish to make substantive points. I assure the hon. Lady that I have no belief that such children are naughty children. I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1220</span>
worked with sufficient children with special educational needs to know that the definition that she is implying that I implied is not correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the assurance. The phrase which the hon. Lady used to lead us to believe she held such an opinion was something like, "There is a need for small special school places when you look at the number of children that have been excluded from school." She will find in 	<i>Hansard</i> that she used a phrase similar to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make three brief points about grant-maintained special schools. Though many of the arguments have been discussed, I still have worries. The Minister and Conservative Members put great store by choice, such as a parent's right to choose from a range of schools. That has been a theme of our discussion. We have differed on how important the right is and how real a choice parents have. My worry about grant-maintained schools is that there is something that is above and beyond the right of parents of special needs chldren to choose. Sufficient appropriate places must be made available for special needs pupils. That must be our prime consideration. It must be above and beyond what a Conservative Member described as schools' "aim and wish to control their own affairs". The problem with the Bill is that we are faced with the choice of legislating for a school being able to control its affairs or for an education system with sufficient and appropriate places for special needs children. I come down on the side of the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that there were a number of reasons why hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree with me. LMS circular 7/88 stated that special schools needed to have had experience of delegated budgets before they received delegated budgets of their own. That implies that there is something peculiar to special needs education that sets it apart from the rest of the education system. Another reason to suggest that there is some agreement that special education should be treated separately is the Bill's provision that LEAs should maintain some control of such education in their geographical area. For both those reasons, it is clear that there is a general acceptance that special needs schools are different and that we need to take a different approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it in the interests of special needs schools to have them operating in the grant-maintained sector? That is the key question. It has nothing to do with a philosophy of choice, or the rights of school governors. I maintain that it is not in those schools' interests, because LEAs have the right and responsibility to supervise the provision of special needs places in their geographical area. That responsibility to maintain overall supervision or oversight of special needs provision will be made much more difficult if some special schools operate in another sector. It can be carried out most efficiently if LEAs maintain the responsibility to secure sufficient places. Opposition Members fear that the dialogue between LEAs and the funding council will be difficult. We have run through the arguments about parallel responsibility and the exchange of information. Time will tell whether that relationship works, but I hope that there will be a measure of agreement in the Committee that the dialogue between those bodies will be made much more difficult by the fact that one of them will have overall responsibility for overseeing special needs functions in the LEA area. The Minister, in his introduction, did not spell out clearly enough the way in which that relationship will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1221</span>
My second point is that special needs education is not a suitable arena for the operation of the Government's notion of competition among schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend talked about the way in which a special school could keep on its roll children who might be better placed elsewhere, or otherwise integrated into mainstream education, because not to keep them would jeopardise that school's existence. Such action by special needs schools must be avoided at all costs as its consequences for children would be much more terrible than similar action by a GM mainstream school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, a special school which cannot keep up its numbers because children are not placed with it by the LEA faces extinction. In those circumstances, a school may take a course of action whose prime objective is to secure the intake of sufficient numbers to keep the school running and the money coming in. Without money, the school will cease to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee believe that that is a good way for schools to operate because it works on the basis that good schools will attract more pupils and that will enable them to expand. Therefore, everyone can have more of a good thing. Bad schools will not attract pupils. If they go to the wall that does not matter because they were bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That policy cannot be allowed to operate for special needs education. We must consider much more carefully the needs of the individual child. In placing that child, we use a procedure that applies to no other child—we produce a statement. The statementing process—a Government policy that has drawn admiration from Opposition Members—is an example of how our education system should operate. I often think that every child should undergo the statementing process. Only then will the child receive tailor-made education from the teacher. However, I know that that is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept that when we place special needs pupils, finance, competition or the needs of the school to stay in existence must not be taken into account. The prime consideration must be the provision of a suitable place for the child. I fear that the ethos of competition and market forces will take precedence over the needs of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not make a strong case for not waiting some time until LMSS was in place properly. At the beginning of his speech, he said that he wanted to wait until LMSS had been introduced and established, but as the debate progressed he dropped the word established. I do not know what he meant by his original use of the word "establish", but it implies to me that the system has not only been put on the statute book, but that it has bedded in, that teething problems have been overcome and that people have adjusted to it in the light of experience. If the Minister were to return to his original phrase—"let us wait until local management of special schools is introduced and established"—and he meant what he said, that move would be applauded by Opposition members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not wait until we have seen how LMS works before we create grant-maintained special schools? When the Government introduced LMS, they correctly made special schools wait because they are a special sector of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1222</span>
education. Will the Minister make them wait again to ensure that we get the proposals right? They are difficult schools in which to teach and to manage so let us give them the benefit of seeing how LMSS settles in before we thrust on to them the procedures involved in moving to grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very disappointed with the way in which the Minister moved the Government amendments even though I knew he would do it that way. The clause deals with the most consensual part of the Bill—the provision of special educational needs—but the Minister gave us short notice of his proposals and there has not been enough consultation on them. He has treated the Committee in a cavalier fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) pointed out that the provision of sufficient school places by a LEA gives that authority a duty to ensure that there are sufficient places for pupils with special needs. That is done in a co-ordinated fashion in a network of schools throughout the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the fact that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye said that a whole panoply of special needs were catered for in the special school that she mentioned. I would like to examine that claim in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special needs can range from moderate to severe learning difficulties and include emotional and behavioural difficulties, physical disabilities and hearing and sight impairment. There is also a need for special residential schools. It is not as though special needs are provided for in one establishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify that I did not suggest that all special needs could be catered for in one school. I said that special schools that mainly cater for one particular special educational need could come together as a group of grant-maintained schools on a managerial basis so that they could offer the full range of services to each education authority that wishes to use them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a useful intervention; I had the impression from the hon. Lady that they were all provided in a one-stop shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that most LEAs do that already in the special needs schools in their areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend makes a valuable point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LEAs must provide places for the pupils in their areas. My authority covers a diverse county. The admissions policy to special schools for moderate, severe, educational, emotional, or behavioural difficulties is run by the special educational needs panel at county hall. Access to those schools is through the statementing procedure. If special schools are allowed to leave the locally provided network and go under the central control of the Government by seeking grant-maintained status, what will be the admissions policy and who will determine it? Will it still be the panel at county hall, or will it be the school? We need a straightforward answer to that. A concept of special needs provision that is based on an admissions policy operating at the school would change the nature of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a special school achieves grant-maintained status, will the clauses that will make significant changes apply to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1223</span>
that special school? Will it be allowed to change its admissions policy? If so, that will upset the balance of special needs provision in the LEA. What about the charging regime? When LEA boundaries are crossed, one LEA charges the other LEA for the pupil's place in its special school. Will that still be the case with the grant-maintained special school? If there is a charge, does the LEA or the school receive the money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye let the cat out of the bag on one point. We have said all along that there is a driving force for integration. However, that means that special schools will close when their rolls run down. Will the Minister assure the Committee, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, that when a special school that is threatened with closure applies for grant-maintained status, it will not be accepted? Is the Minister committed to the integration of pupils with special needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the hon. Gentleman that in her speech to the National Association of Head Teachers in Buxton, Baroness Warnock said that a member of her committee suggested that the best way to deal with some of those pupils was to send them to special boarding schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Special boarding schools is a new term. We have always referred to special schools dealing with a particular need or difficulty. If Baroness Warnock says that there is still a need for special schools, she is merely agreeing with Opposition Members that there cannot be 100 per cent. integration and that there will always be a need for special schools, but that there should be a presumption in favour of integration. Every pupil should be given the opportunity to be educated in ordinary schools. I think that the Minister agrees with me and will tell the Committee, "I make the policies, not the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Self-evidently so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is self-evident and I thank him for that. I shall conclude to give the Minister ample time to answer the points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have put forward inconsistent arguments in favour of grant-maintained schools. First, they used the opting out of control from the LEAs as one argument, but most grant-maintained schools have opted out of Tory LEAs. They then said that it was to the financial benefit of schools to opt out; the consultation documents prove that that financial bribery is no longer applicable. They now say that the schools will be given greater autonomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation process on the White Paper, how many special schools wrote to say that they would like more autonomy from their LEA and would demand grant-maintained status? I think that the answer is none. The autonomy is not applicable in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has not been made for special schools to have grant-maintained status. The Government are not even prepared to let them experience LMS before they bring this measure to the statute book. I mentioned in my maiden speech and on Second Reading that it is important that special educational needs should be needs led: the needs of pupils should be considered before the programme put forward this evening. Dogma has triumphed over common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1224</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. I thank all Members who have participated against, I admit, difficult circumstances, when amendments are tabled at relatively short notice. I have to react to all Opposition amendments at shorter notice, but I have not yet complained. Nevertheless, I accept that there are many amendments, which are difficult to digest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot share the reservations that the hon. Members for Bridgend and for Yardley expressed about the threat to integration policy. To a large extent, determining which pupils will go to special schools will be driven by the statementing process, combined with parental choice. To pose that as a great threat to a policy of integration is wrong. I have already said, as does the Bill in an earlier clause, that, where possible and when it is right for the child, a child with identified special educational needs should be educated in mainstream provision. We all agree on that. I disagree that it should be pushed artificially in that direction. I do not agree that the role of special schools will necessarily diminish as rapidly as possible, to zero. There is always likely to be a role for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we agree on that point, we are discussing the natural development of the special school community, which will either build on what it has been, or, in a more diverse regime, allow for the possibility of grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer the question that I posed and which my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) also posed very forceably, on what happens when the local authority has a policy for developing integrated facilities, which would result in one of its schools being faced with a closure proposal, and that school then decides to opt for grant-maintained special status? On the one hand, the Minister is in favour of developing integrated education, yet, on the other is in favour of establishing grant-maintained specialist schools. How will the Minister decide impartially between the schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have made an issue of this point, but it is not as difficult as they make out. The decision will be approached in the same way as it will be in the ordinary mainstream sector. I have said over and again that no school, be it mainstream or special, will be able to escape a closure proposal by applying for grant-maintained status. The Secretary of State will examine the circumstances, the needs of the area and the needs of the children and then make a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure Opposition Members that no school, ordinary or special, should imagine that it can avoid a closure proposal simply by applying for grant-maintained status. We are assuming that the ballot has gone the right way, but even if it has, it cannot be supposed that the Secretary of State will give automatic approval. I give that assurance readily, but I do not see that there is a problem, because we do not want schools that are unlikely to attract pupils, and are therefore unlikely to be viable, to become grant-maintained. It is not in our interests for the grant-maintained sector to be composed of such schools. There is no policy dilemma; it is more straightforward than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warrington, South again asked how many special schools responded to the White Paper vehemently demanding the option of special status. I cannot give an answer off the cuff, but it does not matter because the policy has not been based on that. Even if no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1225</span>
special schools had responded, that would not be relevant either. The amendments provide a choice. If Opposition Members believe that grant-maintained status is so profoundly unattractive to special schools, they need not worry. They need lose not a minute's sleep over this, because if they are right, no special schools will apply for grant-maintained status and the policy will not even be activated. So even if the Committee approved my amendments, the proposal would lie dormant in the Bill when it became an Act and that would be the end of it. Opposition Members can reassure themselves that if their assumptions are correct there should not be a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are surplus places in special schools, what will be the procedure for determining which school closes? I accept that there is a clear division between the grant-maintained sector and the LEA sector. It comes back to the problem of the interface of decision making because of the special responsibilities of LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the answer lies partly in the hon. Lady's intervention. Both the LEAs, where they have a continuing role, and the funding agency for schools, when it becomes operative, will have a responsibility to provide for special educational needs. That is embedded in schedule 2 part II paragraph 2(2)(b) which says:
	<br><q><p>"In exercising those powers, the funding authority shall have regard to the need for securing … (b) that special educational provision is made for pupils who have special educational needs."</p></q>
That answers one of the points that the hon. Lady raised earlier. The funding agency for schools will be responsible for providing special needs education. There is no dilemma. The hon. Lady suggested that the responsibility to secure sufficient places is compatible with schools' ability to control their own destinies. It is nothing of the kind. It is perfectly possible for the funding agency to provide sufficient and adequate places in mainstream schools and in special schools and for the schools to operate autonomously, with greater management freedom and with the other benefits of grant-maintained status but within the framework of the overall provision of sufficient places. Judgment about surplus places will be made in the same way. The planning authority—the LEA or the FAS, which will exchange information and work together—will decide whether there are sufficient or insufficient places in the mainstream or the special education sector. If there are insufficient places, the possibility will exist to expand or build a new school. The planning authorities will also have to decide, in the case of surplus places, whether a school should be closed. That is not as problematic as the Opposition have suggested. Many Opposition Members claim that we should wait until we have experience of delegated budgets before proceeding with the policy.

Interestingly, eight LEAs have already presented schemes to fund special schools by formula by April 1993. We shall, therefore have experience of that before April 1994.

Member for Bridgend in suspense while I answer a question that he asked about new clause 31. He asked about new clause 31(4). Clause 114(1) of the Oppositions's favourite Act—the Education Act 1944—defines "proprietor" as:
	<br><q><p>"the person or body of persons responsible for the management of the school".</p></q>
That applies to the governing body of a maintained or grant-maintained school. I am sure that the Opposition find such 1944 Act jargon comforting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eight LEAs that I mentioned are: Lincolnshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northumberland, Brent, Harrow, Rotherham and Bromley. I shall give the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered the question about the admissions policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The immediate answer is that grant-maintained special schools have no freedom to alter their admissions policy in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested. The Secretary of State would have to approve any alteration. That also applies to mainstream schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most children attend special schools as a result of a statementing process. They will attend grant-maintained special schools through a combination of parental choice and the statementing process. The admissions policy will not be as significant for special schools as for mainstream schools. Their admissions policies will have anyway to be approved by the Secretary of State. They will not be able to change that will, if I can put it that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Admissions to special schools are currently organised by the special needs department of the LEA.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is related to the issue of admissions and to the funding formula or arrangements. Since children attending special schools will have statements, will the funding formula provide that the school will have the necessary money to implement the statement? If so, will special schools vie with each other to provide facilities more cheaply? Even if we cannot know the funding formula, what principles will be behind it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here I am at a disadvantage because I cannot give the precise answers that the hon.

That is partly because that matter will be subsumed within the common funding formula—on which we are consulting—for all grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad principle is that funding for special schools is primarily place based rather than pupil driven. I anticipate that that will be the main component of the funding arrangement for grant-maintained special schools, together with whatever arrangements we think necessary, partly to reflect the matter about which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a child's statement requires a very expensive piece of equipment or a major adaptation to the school, will the formula provide that the school will be given the necessary money, or will the school be expected to find the money for any need it must meet in a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question is that, as now, the LEA will provide equipment for individual pupils as part of statementing. That funding is the pupil's entitlement and will therefore go with the pupil to the school. So, very broadly, that position will not change radically, even though the school has become grant maintained. I shall reconsider the hon. Gentleman's question and, if I have misled him, I shall return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last few minutes, I should like to consider the important points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye. I am attracted by the thrust of her remarks that related to mainstream provision in the grant-maintained sector. She said that most special schools tend to be rather small and, therefore, for the same reason that we thought a clustering arrangement may be attractive to small primary schools, it may be equally attractive to small special schools. We should bear that factor very much in mind. If we were to contemplate clustering special schools with mainstream schools, it could help not only to increase co-operation but the integration process that Opposition members of the Committee are so enthusiastic to encourage. That is a great plus point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, there are problems with my hon. Friend's proposals. One is the nature and size of the governing body that would have to be devised to give proper representation to the special schools. Another would be funding arrangements and how that would interplay between mainstream schools and special schools in such a cluster. I should like to consider the implications of how my hon. Friend's proposals might work and, with my ministerial colleague and officials, examine whether it could be developed. If so, I shall be in touch with my hon. Friend to inform her of how it would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee can support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
