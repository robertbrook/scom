	<p>[Continuation from column 394]</p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I should now turn to a matter that has been mentioned frequently—the alleged apparent contradictions between the concept of surplus places, and parental choice. The White Paper identified up to 1·5 million surplus places in England—the "up to" is quite important. My Department, in its dealings with local education authorities up to now, has received returns of figures from them. When aggregated, those figures produced the calculation of up to 1·5 million surplus places. The LEAs' own figures therefore produced that total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now engaged in the next round of the process. We have invited LEAs to identify how they will deal with the surplus places as a result of figures thrown up in their area. When that is known, we shall find ways of tackling the problem on an authority-by-authority basis. So far, that has been relatively straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help the Committee if the Minister would quantify the savings that he thinks could be made by closing school places. If he closed, say, 1 million places, how much does he think he would save from the education budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Off the top of my head, about £200 million, but I shall verify that figure. It is not desperately meaningful to give a global figure; we can only give notional figures of that sort. What really matters is what funds can be released, authority by authority, circumstance by circumstance and case by case, by tackling seriously the surplus place problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day I received a deputation from an LEA, accompanied by two Members of Parliament—one from each major party. The LEA has about 30,000 surplus places, according to the criteria with which we are working. We discussed what that meant and that deputation agreed that it must continue its attempt to tackle the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Porter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Waveney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell the Committee what the criteria are? How does he define surplus places?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend asked that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the Minister does not have an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because I have a piece of paper in my hand from which to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea asked the same question. Put simply, surplus places are the total capacity of schools minus the pupils on roll. That is self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is how we quantify the capacity. There are two ways of doing this: the standard-number-times-a-year group basis and the more open enrolment calculation. Both may produce different answers. Whichever formulation we use, we still throw up a large number of surplus places, LEA by LEA. The way in which the Department has calculated that capacity is detailed in circulars. I shall be happy to give my hon. Friends copies so that they can see the basis upon which my Department sets about calculating school capacity, measuring it against numbers on roll and arriving at the difference which, by definition, is a surplus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of that definition, what do the Government expect the class size to be in those schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Class numbers are not involved. It is for schools and LEAs to determine, class sizes, as the Committee would expect. The Department does not dictate or determine the size of classes. Even my Department does not have that amount of omniscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claims that the Department does not dictate the size of classes. What has he to say about a school which re-organised its classes two or three years ago, so was able to make one room available as a computer centre, but which, nevertheless, had 30 surplus places? Would that school be made to fill those places or take other action to bring down costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory is correct, that space would be counted in the overall physical capacity of the school, which would be well known to the head and governors of the school, and to the LEA. In one sense, it would be up to them to decide how to use the available space; at the same time, they could not reasonably argue that they were astonished when the well-known formula applied by my Department identified surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that no one will dispute the proposition that there must be a point of reference. We cannot let the system float freely and let schools keep buildings half-empty at a whim—that is resource costly. The fact that we must deal with the problem of surplus capacity is common ground. Nationally, authority by authority and school by school, surplus capacity adds up to wasteful use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is scope for dialogue over the precise meaning of the definitions, how they work and how they are applied in practice. That is even more relevant when we decide how far it is reasonable to allow for demographic changes in the calculations, for example—a point made frequently by hon. Members—or for providing a reasonable margin of capacity to enhance parental choice. That is also self-evidently important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is about to come to the specifics that I mentioned earlier, one of which was comparable to a point made by the hon. Member for Bridgend about room made available for use as a computer room. I accept that point entirely and it should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My LEA, which was the first in the country to offer free nursery places for every three-year-old in the borough whose parents want that place, has a problem. It is using surplus classrooms in primary schools for their purpose. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
has been told by officials of the Department for Education that that is not taken into account, therefore the authority still has surplus places. Guidance to LEAs on assessing what empty spaces mean is needed. Will my hon. Friend bear that in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that important point. It highlights the next stage in the procedure. Authorities must come to my Department and say—as the LEA whose representatives I met the other day said—"Here are the figures thrown up by the exercise that we have embarked upon jointly. Your Department asked us for returns, which we have provided. On that basis, you have claimed a certain number of surplus places. We think that the number differs, for the following reasons." We can then identify the available, disposable or manageable number of surplus places and deal with them propertly. That is a perfectly businesslike way to proceed and I hope that the authorities will agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister estimated that £200 million would be saved by removing surplus places. How will those savings be made? Will there be fewer teachers or buildings, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is self-evident that the combination of factors will vary, almost school by school and certainly, authority by authority. The surplus may be represented by an entire school, or by parts of a building that are expensive to maintain. Money could be released if those buildings no longer had to be maintained. I cannot tell the Committee, on the basis of 1·5 million surplus places and several hundreds of millions of pounds, exactly how savings will be made. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport knows almost as well as I do that the savings made by dealing effectively with surplus places will be achieved in different ways. It is unacceptable that many authorities have carried a large number of surplus places for a long time, thus wasting resources. We want to tackle that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that a saving of £200 million could be made if all the surplus school places were removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not all the surplus places—1 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A million school places would save £200 million. That figure is based on assumptions to which the Minister alluded. Can he say how many teachers' redundancies are included in that calculation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. That is not necessarily part of the issue because the figure is a premises-related cost. It has nothing to do with teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it not include teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not include teachers. How many times do I have to tell the hon. Gentleman? The figure that I gave is premises-related. It does not include teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it include teacher redundancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The employment of teachers is a matter for LEAs or for grant-maintained school governing bodies. They must decide the appropriate number of teachers. The surplus places exercise is carried out according to the two
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
formulations that I gave earlier. It is then related to the number of pupils on the school roll. It has nothing to do with teacher redundancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How flexible could the Department be in taking decisions to encourage local authorities to get rid of surplus places? For example, there may be two or three schools in an LEA area in which a quarter of the space is under-used. It would be relatively easy to work out a plan for reducing surplus places in those circumstances, but what about a local authority that had a large number of surplus places evenly spread throughout its schools, perhaps an average of one classroom per school? Would the Minister still insist that that local authority reorganised or got rid of one or two schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would encourage such an authority to consider the distribution of places to discover whether resources could be used more effectively. That may involve the closure of two or three old school buildings and their replacement by one or two new ones. In that way there is a double whammy: an improvement in the provision of places and a saving of money and resources. We encourage such exercises. When considering authorities' capital bids, we check carefully whether authorities are taking that positive and sensible approach to the rationalisation of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend made a rather puzzling remark at the beginning of his contribution when he suggested that surplus places would manifest themselves in bulging schools. He asked how we squared parental choice with the removal of surplus places. I suspect that the matter is usually the other way round. Almost by definition, surplus places are found in under-subscribed schools which are operating at way under their capacity. The conflict that the hon. Gentleman described between parental choice and surplus places does not exist. What I have described is far more the normal case than what the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to help the Minister. I made my comments in connection with a specific school, the county primary school in Norfolk, which is operating at less than half of its capacity. That means that surplus places exist in that school. Nevertheless, it remains popular and is not failing, but it is down for closure in order to remove surplus places. I am worried about such schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is right but I shall not be drawn into discussing individual schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that parental choice is curtailed if a popular school is full and parents cannot get their children into it? That also poses a problem about choice and is therefore relevant to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so. In such circumstances, a combination of the school and the authorities—whoever they may be—begin to make decisions about enlarging the premises or building a new school and so on. The Bill contains procedures for that process to take place both in the LEA sector and the funding agency sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of the funding agency, we know that its core staff will come from section four of the DFE, as the Minister has said. We also know that, because there are about 20 Conservative LEAs where the 10 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
cent, trigger has already been activated, the funding agency, immediately upon its creation and side by side with the LEA, will have a duty to examine the organisation of schooling in those areas. Where will the funding agency find the necessary staff? Will they come from section one of the DFE staff, who already deal with the matter, or will they be local authority staff with the appropriate expertise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must repeat that we must stay close to the subject of the group of amendments. They do not deal with staff, but with placements only. We shall have other opportunities to talk about staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, of course, follow your guidance, Mr. Martin, and give the hon. Member for Bridgend an answer at an appropriate time. I have nothing to hide and there is almost nothing up my sleeve. I shall press on and answer some of the questions raised by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10 of schedule 15 contains an important change to section 76 of the Education Act 19441 shall read out the new version in full to put the matter in context. The section states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the exercise and performance of all powers and duties conferred and imposed on them by this Act"</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State for Education, the funding authorities—that is the new wording—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and local education authorities shall have regard to the general principle that, so far as is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure, pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents."</p></blockquote>
That encapsulates the notion of parental choice with the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure. That combination is currently sought by LEAs and will be sought by the funding agency. The Bill requires the funding agency for schools to provide sufficient school places—"School places" is the sub-title of the clause—and to maximise parental choice with the proviso that unreasonable public expenditure is avoided. That is only one of the safeguards against the funding agency for schools running riot and needlessly setting up new grant-maintained schools all over the place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport asked whether the funding agency will have to consult. The answer is yes. It will have to produce statutory proposals to which objections could be made. Any objections would be dealt with by the Secretary of State. That is one of many provisions that show that the funding agency will not have carte blanche to spend a huge bag of swag on needless new schools. The funding agency will be required to provide sufficient school places in its sector in accordance with the trigger points under clause 7. It must act responsibly because of the considerable sums of taxpayers' money involved. It will be accountable to the Secretary of State, to the House and to the Comptroller and Auditor General for its use of public moneys. Hon. Members should bear that in mind when their more fanciful thoughts lead them to imagine that the funding agency will run riot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the points raised by Opposition Members. I have referred to other clauses and schedules in the Bill, but that is inevitable as they are interrelated. I hope that I have reinforced the argument that the funding agency will be working in parallel with the LEAs, which would have a continuing role. That accountable funding agency will have clearly prescribed duties and responsibilities laid out in the Bill. Its overall objective will be to provide sufficient school places; that will complement the aims and objectives of the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
The Bill more than adequately covers the objections close to the hearts of Opposition Members. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been useful and, at times, illuminating. We are now beginning to get a picture of the education world should the Bill be enacted. Probably at least 1 million of the 1·5 million surplus places will be removed. That will mean the closure of thousands of secondary and primary schools in England and Wales. We have not previously witnessed a schools closure programme on such a scale, but that is the implication of what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should no longer refer to parental choice because it will not be available. The White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents have been given by the Government the right to express a preference as to where they would like their children to go to school."</p></blockquote>
It is no stronger than that: the expression of a preference. It would be helpful if we used that term rather than the rhetoric of parental choice, which the Government are so keen on. I am pleased that the Minister has acknowledged that a degree of surplus capacity must be kept within the system if parents are to be allowed to exercise some preference for the school to which they want to send their child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, I am fairly certain that all of the statutes that refer to parents speak of parental "preference" rather than "choice". The hon. Gentleman follows the wording of the statutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was comparing the wording of the Acts and of the White Paper—which, quite rightly, refers to "preference"—with the statements of Conservative politicians. All too often, they use the terms parental "choice", but the legal position is that people are given the right not to choice but to express a preference, which is quite different. Parents can express a preference but not choose the school to which they want to send their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a situation in my constituency in which the LEA has repeatedly refused to allow a popular school to increase its standard number, despite the fact that the accommodation is available. Parents want to send their children to the school. The education authority is run by the Labour party. That party denies parents in that area their rightful wish to send their children—by preference or by choice—to that school. The governing body has, quite rightly, appealed to the Secretary of State. Whatever semantics the hon. Gentleman wants to use on the issue —preference or choice—the Conservative party allows a degree of choice to parents whereas the Labour party refuses them that choice altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I point out to the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) that governors have been given the right of appeal against an unfair admissions number laid down by a local LEA. Successive Governments—not just Conservative ones—have recognised that right. We all acknowledge it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is not an exercise in semantics; a parent who has expressed a preference that has been denied will know the difference between preference and choice all too clearly. Arguments for extending parental choice come badly from the Conservative Government when Conservative members of the Committee will be aware
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
that it is the Treasury that determines parental choice throughout the Bill and determines when capital needs to be made available to enable popular schools to expand. The Treasury acts as the dead hand on the extension of parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may not be aware of what occurred just before the general election in April. The Government put forward a proposal that had originally been suggested by LEAs who had said, "We have popular schools that are full. We need additional capital to be made available so that they can add new buildings to expand to meet greater parental demand." Before the election it was suggested that additional capital would be made available to help popular schools expand. Since the election, that policy has been reversed: the additional capital is no longer available. Conservative Members should not speak of parental "preference", even, when their Government have acted in that way. Before the April election the money was on the table; after the election it was taken off the table because it was no longer needed to save the seat of the then hon. Member for Darlington, Mr. Fallon, the former Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously unaware of the situation in my constituency where the LEA has for 10 years refused to allow a popular school one penny of capital in order to ensure that parents send their children to schools to which they do not want their children to go. That is an example of your party restricting over 10 years any choice that parents wish to exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The important point made by the hon. Member for Erewash is that for the past 13 years capital controls on LEAs have been dictated by the Government on the basis of annual capital guidance, approval to borrow money in the market. Since 1981, the amount of money that the Government have permitted LEAs to borrow has declined in real terms.

Derbyshire is one of those authorities that has made a capital bid this year for next year. It may be news to the hon. Member for Erewash, but the capital bids for 1993–94 from all local authorities in England came to about £1·5 billion. In the autumn statement, the Government permitted just under £600 million. It is not LEAs, of all political persuasion, which, of their own volition, are not spending on capital; they are operating under constraints imposed on them by a Conservative Government. That is where the responsibility lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The majority of Derbyshire county council's capital expenditure on schools is being spent in Chesterfield. I remind him that Chesterfield is represented by a member of the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Derbyshire LEA—like many LEAs—has included in its bid items that are the true and proper maintenance function of the LEA, which should be included, as a matter of priority, in its total budget. It would be better advised
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
to spend that money on such items as the repair of schools rather than on the propaganda leaflets, which it is sending round to every household in the county. It is a question of priorities. The priorities that the councils are choosing are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to when the hon. Member for Erewash makes a speech in the Committee and does not have to rely on interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was a member of Sheffield city council, before she became an hon. Member of the House. It was a good Labour council and my colleagues, such as Steven Jones who used to chair the education committee in Sheffield—[HON. MEMBERS: "Sheffield, a good authority?"] Yes, it was, because the hon. Member for Erewash was a member. One of the reasons, no doubt, why she was not elevated to a position there is because she clearly cannot tell the difference between capital and revenue spending. Capital spending cannot be used for the production of leaflets or propaganda: capital is for capital purposes. I hope that that point is constructive to the hon. Lady.

The Minister talked about 1 million surplus places that might be removed, as opposed to 1·5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Devonport used the illustrative figure of £1 million, to which I responded. I did not initiate that figure, simply because I do not know what it is. We think that the figure will be about £1·5 million. I cannot say what an achievable figure of surplus place removal is for the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a particularly disappointing answer, even from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a straightforward answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and a simple answer, which we have come to expect from the Minister. It was unhelpful because some indication of what the margin of surplus capacity will be is needed. There may be no remaining surplus capacity to allow a preference. The only way to ensure maximum use of school places is through centralised control over schools, whereby parents are directed to a particular school for their children. Only in that way will surplus places be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate about Marsham county primary school in Norfolk has been helpful. It has revealed the Government's black-and-white approach to surplus capacity. They believe that if a school is working well, it is popular and therefore full, and that if a school is failing, it is unpopular and therefore has surplus places. Paragraph 4.1 of the White Paper makes that exact distinction. We have to acknowledge that there are popular schools which are not failing, which are delivering the national curriculum and offering a high standard of education, but which have surplus places. However, the writing is on the wall for such schools according to the Bill. The hon. Member for Norwich, North made that clear when he said that such schools would have to be closed in order to allow an extension of parental preference elsewhere in the system. Parents would pay the price of making money available to enlarge schools elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury is again determining the education system. If more money were made available, most schools could expand and schools such as Marsham county primary could continue. We are being told that there is no additional money from the Treasury and that schools therefore have to be closed to make the £200 million premises cost savings referred to by the Minister. That

	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
£200 million will be recycled back into the system to enlarge schools so that more places are made available. The Treasury is dictating education policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman asking us to believe that Labour party policy is that parental preference should be entirely unconstrained by any concept of the efficient use of school capital? Is he suggesting that irrespective of the number of pupils who want to go to a particular school, all schools to which parents send their children should be kept open? If so, he ought to tell us at what capacity he and the Labour party would think it appropriate to close schools. He is suggesting an entirely open-ended option, which would waste an enormous amount of taxpayers' money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the question. This is the third group of amendments that I have moved which refers specifically to efficiency and effectiveness. The Bill will work against the efficient provision of education because no parameters are laid down. I strongly believe that we need an education system which is managed locally. Under such circumstances, a group of elected people would respond to the pressures to which the hon. Gentleman referred. If they failed to respond to those pressures, the democratic process would have its way and they would be put out of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for a funding agency that consists of 10 to 15 people appointed by the Secretary of State. They will be in no position to respond to local pressures; they will not believe that they have to do so. They are not answerable to a democratic process. I believe in democracy, which will ensure that the education service meets local needs and aspirations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's faith in democracy. I was a member of a LEA for 16 years and I support LEAs. But the hon. Gentleman's democracy has left us with 1·5 million surplus places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not having figures with me to show how many surplus places LEAs were taking out of the system before the Government introduced grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise makes it difficult for 	<i>Hansard</i> to hear the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to a hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that I mentioned show that before grant-maintained status was introduced, LEAs of all political persuasions made an effort to take out surplus places. The first round of schools that applied for grant-maintained status did so because they were threatened with reorganisation or closure. Since then, it has been difficult for LEAs to take out surplus places. Every school governing body can hold a gun to their heads and threaten to opt out if the LEA reorganises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of surplus places has, therefore, not proceeded as it would have done had the opt-out option been unavailable. However, financial pressures have obliged LEAs to move to take out surplus places. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
a difficult task because schools threaten to opt out to avoid closure. It will be interesting to note how the new team in Sanctuary buildings responds to applications from schools that are trying to escape reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for another opportunity to say as clearly as I can that any application for grant-maintained status by a school that has been through the balloting procedure will be treated on its merits by the Secretary of State. He is statutorily obliged to do that. He will not encourage schools to believe that they can avoid closure simply by balloting for grant-maintained status, which will be granted automatically. I shall use every opportunity to make that clear so that no one is under any illusion. To date, of all schools under threat of closure that have applied for grant-maintained status, 33 have been successful and 33 unsuccessful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was attempting to explain to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East the reluctance of local education authorities to reorganise schools. Schools that are threatened with closure will apply to become grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we could solve the problem now if the Secretary of State states categorically that he will not accept applications for grant-maintained status from schools that are threatened with closure or reorganisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. If we are serious about removing up to 1·5 million surplus places, there should be an opportunity to stop the opting out process until the surplus places are removed. We could then start afresh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to help the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South. It is just conceivable that a local education authority might attempt to close a school for some malicious reason. In such circumstances, it would be inappropriate to give the undertaking sought by the hon. Member for Warrington, South. However, no Secretary of State could give such an undertaking anyway, as he would be in breach of his statutory obligation to consider each case on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but our point is that such a situation will cause practical difficulty in the process of removing surplus places. It is no good running away from the real difficulties faced by LEAs when they embark on reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with the question of parental preference, but the other main aspect of the amendments is the way in which the Bill will change the basis of the grant-maintained sector. So far it has been clear that schools can become grant maintained only as a result of an affirmative vote by parents which gains subsequent approval by the Secretary of State. Parents have acted as the motor for the grant-maintained system. The Bill will change that. In certain circumstances, the funding agencies will promote new schools under the provisions of clause 40, and clause 86 will enable them significantly to enlarge grant-maintained schools. The Bill will replace the power of parents to promote grant-maintained schools with the power of a Government-appointed body—the funding agency—to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear that it will be for local education authorities to remove surplus places in local authority schools, while the funding agency will promote
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
new grant-maintained schools. The division of responsibilities is very clear. The dilemma stems from the fact that, if the funding agency were to promote a new grant-maintained school and create an additional 2,000 places in a local education authority area, that local education authority will suddenly have a number of surplus places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will listen he may find this helpful. The funding agency may not alter its plans, but the Bill will give the Secretary of State the power to take steps in a local authority area where he considers there to be surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that the funding agency, operating in parallel, may set up a grant-maintained school with 2,000 additional places. The Secretary of State can then look at the provision in that local authority area and decide that surplus places exist that should be removed. That is my understanding of the Bill, but I shall accept the Minister's guidance if it is incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. Any proposal made by the funding agency for the provision of new school places would have to be made against the background of established basic need. That could not be established if surplus places were likely to be created. It would then have to become the subject of a statutory proposal, which would, in the normal way, be open to objections from the LEA, parents, other schools and so on. The Secretary of State would determine the matter against that background. It is inconceivable that in such circumstances a Secretary of State would approve the establishment of a new school and the necessary funds that the funding agency would need. The hon. Gentleman is on the wrong track.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State must make that judgment. The Bill gives him a power which I hope he would choose not to exercise. My point is that that power exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in the circumstances described by the Minister, it would be impossible for parents who wanted to establish a new school to do so in a local authority area which had surplus school places. There would be no need for another school if there were already surplus places in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes the position plain. It is another example of how parental preference, let alone choice, will be denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency will have the power under clause 40 to set up a new grant-maintained school if it wishes to do so. However, it will be for the Secretary of State to make an order under clause 7 to bring that into effect. There is no requirement for the funding agency to ballot or to consult parents, merely vague words about consultation. We need to know what the Secretary of State will take into account before he makes an order under clause 7 to effect an application under clause 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on the criteria mentioned by his hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend? Will he ponder whether the Bill will ensure that what the Minister said will take effect? Hon. Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
have said that grant-maintained school applications prevent reorganisation. The Minister has assured us that that will not happen in future. However, 15 city technology colleges have been established in areas where there was no shortage of places. In my LEA area—Avon —there was recently a topping-out ceremony for a city technology college in an area where there is no evidence of a shortage of places: indeed, the reverse is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example of the chaos and confusion in the education service. Gimmicks are all-important and the practical realities of providing a high-quality education service are ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was a safeguard—a statutory procedure—to prevent the funding agency going off on a frolic of its own. The present statutory procedure for the closure or change of character of a school is completely inadequate; it cannot meet the needs of the 1990s, whether the proposal comes from the local authority or from the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a genuine suggestion for the Minister which I have not discussed with my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench. Under the Bill, if the Secretary of State makes a proposal for reorganisation, the matter will go to a public inquiry. That important initiative is one of the Bill's few wise proposals. I suggest that the local education authority or funding agency proposal for reorganisation or closure should also be subject to local scrutiny at a public inquiry, when local people can make their objections known to the independent chair. If that is good enough for the Secretary of State, the same procedure should apply to local education authorities and to proposals from the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a system could be set up without statutory requirements. To extend the public inquiry to cover not only the Secretary of State's proposals but those of the funding agency and the local education authority would ensure that the views of parents and the local community are heard. I would be interested to hear arguments against such a public inquiry system for the funding agency and LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members believe that the hon. Gentleman is, without question, the most knowledgeable member of the Opposition Benches. Notwithstanding his party's attitude in the 1980s, does he now approve of local management of schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local management of schools was based on initiatives from local education authorities such as Cambridge, Inner London, Salford and North Tyneside, which delegated budgets to individual schools. Local management of schools causes many of us difficulties because of the strict formula used. Do Conservative Members defend the delegation of budgets to schools on the basis of an average teacher's salary and not an actual teacher's salary? Can that be explained to me sensibly? There seem to be few takers? That is the big flaw in local management of schools. The delegation of budgets was promoted by Labour-controlled LEAs before the right hon. Member for Mole Valley even thought of it. I understand that on a visit to Cambridgeshire in mid-1986 he saw it in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman remind us when Cambridgeshire was a Labour-controlled authority? I think that in the mid-1980s it had some vague connection with the Liberals and the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can be helpful. I was a member of the local authority between 1985 and 1989. Cambridgeshire county council was hung and no party had overall control. The Liberal Democrats certainly had no more control than the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made the point that local management of schools was a local authority initiative long before the then Secretary of State took it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can argue about where the idea originated. I conducted an experiment when I chaired the London borough of Kingston upon Thames education authority. Many experiments were being carried out, but those of us who served on the Committee considering the Education Reform Bill recall vividly the Labour party's opposition to the principle long before the formula had been worked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will speak to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a long time to go this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anybody had bothered to read the Labour party manifesto for the previous general election—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] I know that few people did. In it, there is reference to "Governing locally", which is a good system of delegating budgets. It gives far more power and flexibility to schools than the present local management of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of public inquiries is important. The Secretary of State will be subject to a public inquiry system. Those of us who have been involved in LEAs and who have had to take through reorganisation proposals know that the system, in which any 10 local government electors, having seen a notice pasted up on the school gates, can lodge a complaint, dates back to the 19th century. There must be a better system of allowing parents to express their objections and reservations about a school reorganisation process. We should accept that the public inquiry concept, mentioned in the White Paper and in the Bill, should also apply to LEA proposals and to funding agency proposals. I hope that the Minister will consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments are at the heart of the Bill. They address the question of parental choice which would be denied if the Bill was passed unamended. It also recognises our obligation to seek the most efficient use of public resources. On that basis, I wish the Committee to express its view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall compare the wording and duties included in section 8 of the 1944 Act with those in clause 7. Section 8 of the 1944 Act deals with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty of local education authorities to secure provision of primary and secondary schools"</p></blockquote>
and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of every local education authority to secure that there shall be available for their area sufficient schools"</p></blockquote>
to provide primary and secondary education. It goes on to explain that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the schools avaialble for an area shall not be deemed to be sufficient unless they are sufficient in number, character, and equipment to afford for all pupils opportunities for education offering such variety of instruction and training as may be desirable in view of their different ages, abilities, and aptitudes, and of the different periods for which they may be expected to remain at school, including practical instruction and training appropriate to their respective needs."</p></blockquote>

Thus, under section 8 of the 1944 Act, the LEA has a duty to secure that there are sufficient schools for its area. That is not interpreted as necessarily requiring the LEA to establish schools such as county schools or to maintain voluntary schools. An LEA could comply with the section by securing some places in independent schools if it was minded to pay for those places. I shall return to the matter of the provision of appropriate places, and refer to a recent judgment in the Court of Appeal relating to the provision of places for boys and girls in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1944 Act requires that there should be sufficient schools, that they should provide for primary and secondary education, that they should be sufficient in number, character and equipment, and that they should provide a variety of instruction and training for the ages,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
abilities and aptitudes of the pupils. The LEA must secure special educational provision for pupils who have special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 8 is not just about securing sufficient schools. It requires those schools to meet the educational needs of the pupils who attend them. Sections 1 and 7 of the 1944 Act play a supplementary role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not propose any amendment to those sections. It is possible, however, that in the Department for Education at this moment civil servants might be promulgating amendments to remove the inconsistencies created by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1 of the 1944 Act places a duty on the Secretary of State for Education
	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote the education of the people of England and Wales and the progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose, and to secure the effective execution by local authorities, under his control and direction, of the national policy for providing a varied and comprehensive educational service in every area."</p></blockquote>
I understand that that section has not been repealed and that the Secretary of State will retain the duty to secure
	<br><blockquote><p>"the execution by local authorities, under his control and direction, of the national policy for providing a varied and comprehensive educational service in every area."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say whether the creation of funding authorities by the Bill will make a nonsense of that duty? Is section 1 of the 1944 Act to be amended to take account of the creation of the funding authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 7 of the 1944 Act is entitled "Stages and purposes of statutory system of education" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The statutory system of public education shall be organised in three progressive stages".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and it shall be the duty of the local education authority for every area, so far as their powers extend, to contribute to the spiritual, moral, mental and physical development of the community by securing that efficient education throughout those stages shall be made available to meet the needs of the population of their area."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the Bill does not vest the funding authorities with the duties placed on LEAs by the 1944 Act. Those duties apply to all schools in an area. If schools in an area have an allegiance or connection with another body such as a funding authority, must not that other body be vested with the same duties? The Bill does not do that, and I hope that the Minister will explain that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will allow schools to opt out of LEA control, as has already happened in the 20 authorities where the 10 per cent, trigger has been reached. The funding agency will operate in areas where schools opt out and will therefore have a share in the duties which currently reside with the LEA. That is a matter that the Committee must consider because the Bill introduces the possibility that, at some distant date, 75 per cent, of places provided may be in grant-maintained schools. Therefore the funding agency will have total responsibility
	<br><blockquote><p>"for providing sufficient school places"</p></blockquote>
at the 75 per cent, cut-off point—if the Secretary of State decides to let that go through, which, according to the Minister's comments, he intends to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill, we are told about provision of "sufficient school places." The 1944 Act provides for a duty to secure "sufficient schools." That subtle difference may not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
significant, but, in case it is, I will speculate a little and invite the Minister to say whether my speculation is correct, because I should like some idea of what he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement in the Bill to provide sufficient school places differs in its phrasing from that of the White Paper. The Minister has said nothing so far to inspire confidence on my part in what I am about to say, but I think that it should be said. The 1944 Act imposes a duty to provide "sufficient schools". It lays down criteria to which the schools must conform to provide the right type of education in each LEA area. The emphasis is on "sufficient schools."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 refers to "sufficient school places". Does the Minister think that because the Bill encourages the creation of more grant-maintained schools, changing the proposal to provide "sufficient school places" will mean that in the stage between 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, of places being provided in opt-out schools—when there is dual responsibility—the local authority should be the prime mover and adopt a senior role in the partnership? If the 1944 Act reference to "sufficient schools" had been retained in the Bill, it could be argued that, as the duty of the LEA and the funding agency was similar—they both provide schools—the addition of the word "places" would allow the LEA a sort of lead role in the period of dual responsibility. Is that what the Government intended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 proposes the insertion of the word "appropriate". Subsection (1) would then refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient and appropriate school places".</p></blockquote>
If the 1944 Act remained unamended and the funding authorities were vested with those precise duties amendment No. 80, which would amend schedule 6 as well as the clause, might be deemed unnecessary. However, a number of organisations have commented on the different issues that all this raises for special educational needs and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall share with the Committee the views of the Spastics Society about the reference in clause 7 to "sufficient places" only. The society expresses profound concern about the erosion of locally accountable management of education and its replacement by a centrally based Government-appointed body. The society is worried that it could result in a loss of sensitivity to the needs of local electorates and also that the funding agency will lack a detailed knowledge of local circumstances. It fears that during the time between the 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, trigger points, both of the problems will be compounded by confusion over the two bodies, which will be so different. One will be a local authority, subject to accountability to a local electorate through regular elections; the other will be the funding agency, a national body with no local democratic accountability but appointed by the Government to do a specific job. During that critical time, the two bodies must work together. We hope that they will work, meet and be mathematically parallel, despite the role that the LEA will still have during that period in providing places for children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A paradox or inconsistency of the Bill is that whereas in one part the Government are clearly laying specific and important duties on LEAs regarding pupils with special educational needs, in another part they make life more difficult for LEAs. They admit that locally elected councils will not, at some future point, have education committees. Those almost opposing tendencies on the one hand require
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
additional duties of LEAs, while on the other put pressure on them that may result in there being no education committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Spastics Society rightly feels that the new provision between the 10 and 75 per cent, trigger points could lead to special educational needs provision dropping between the cracks, or fault lines—a favourite expression of the Government when they perceive there to be difficulties—in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The society feels that including the word "appropriate" would safeguard provision for children with special educational needs—for whom there is provision elsewhere in the Bill—during a period in which there will be a welter of concerns in the funding agencies and the local educational authorities as they try to work so to speak, in harness and struggle to set up arrangements. The amendment would ensure that children with special educational needs would get the same educational rights as other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broader range of voluntary and charitable organisations concerned with the education of children with special educational needs is also convinced that the amendment would be a valuable addition. The Special Education Consortium points out that such children need not just a school place, but one that is appropriate for them. That applies whether or not a child has a statement. We should take account of features of schools or units within schools that cater for children with special educational needs when considering whether a place is appropriate. The governors should have a clear policy for such children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, there are schools and local authorities that, despite the provisions of the 1944 Act, do not have such a policy. That makes the amendment important. I am not criticising the Government. The second report of the Audit Commission and Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools on special educational needs provides examples of good practice in education authorities of all political persuasions in England and Wales and highlights, for example, Clwyd education authority as having an excellently worked out policy for children with special educational needs. That issue is highlighted in that report, which also considers organisation within schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned Clwyd education authority with regard to special educational needs. The head teacher of Ysgol Pen-y-Bryn in my constituency sent to parents of pupils a letter on the possibility of voting for grant-maintained status. On the subject of special educational needs he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Special Education Needs—The L.E.A. have forced us to use our Special Needs Teacher in another capacity. Whilst the Class Teachers are now responsible for their own Special Needs teaching they do need support. We propose that once we gain G.M.S. the services of a Special Needs teacher will be restored."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a specific point. I say only that if that case is as serious as is claimed in the letter, he should contact HMI and the Audit Commission and point out that the good practice that they referred to in relation to Clwyd county council's policy provision is not as good as it seemed. However, to do that would seem to cast serious doubt on the effectiveness of the work of the Audit Commission and HMI. After all, the report is supposed to reflect good practice and Clwyd is highlighted for that more than once in the report. I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
that the Government will now consult the Audit Commission and HMI to discover whether a shortcoming exists or whether matters are not quite as portrayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on now beyond the issues of clear special educational needs policy and clear organisation to meet special educational needs in schools. Those elements should be combined with resources targeted to meet the appropriate needs of such children. We should consider some of the factors that need to be taken into account when we determine the value of the word "appropriate" in the Bill. It is important that it should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend —	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The background noise is terrible. I cannot hear what the hon. Lady is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I am glad that you were able to stop that noise as I could not hear myself speak either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my hon. Friend's information, I shall refer to a school in which many children have emotional behavioural problems. That is often so in schools which, perhaps, are not very popular with parents, but which nevertheless meet a local need. I think that there is a problem in comparing such a school, which may be under the control of the local education authority, with another, perhaps more popular, school—possibly with grant-maintained status—in deciding how to take surplus places out of the system. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for making that suggestion. I shall consider the question in the next hour or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If education provision is to be appropriate to children with special educational needs, we must take certain factors into account. School buildings must be accessible to children with physical disabilities. To specify the provision of "sufficient" places is inappropriate and falls short of what is needed. That is why our simple addition of the work "appropriate" is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equipment should be available to give children with a range of learning difficulties or sensory impairment access to the curriculum. That means more than providing "sufficient" places: it means making sure that appropriate places are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specialist learning support services should be available. That, too, has nothing to do with "sufficient" places and everything to do with "appropriate" places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be access to support services provided by the district health authority or the social services department. Both are an essential part of the provision of education for children with special educational needs. That, too, goes way beyond the provision of "sufficient school places".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, unfortunately, an increasing number of children with emotional or behavioural problems. To provide sufficient school places in a school or unit especially for those children would fall far short of what is needed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, the word " appropriate" would protect such children in any scheme of reorganisation because places would have to be appropriate, not just sufficient. A strong argument could be advanced for the retention of a specialist service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the provision and rationalisation of school places, we must look beyond the issue of sufficiency
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
to that of appropriateness. It is important, in a general way, to take account of children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is even more sophisticated, difficult and complex than I suggested, as I shall illustrate by referring to children who are deaf, or both deaf and blind. I cite that group of children because those with the severest problems are fortunately in a minority. Nevertheless, the services that they require are varied which is why we should go beyond providing "sufficient" places and provide "appropriate" places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deaf and deaf and blind children live in all areas and have a variety of needs because of the range of deafness from which they suffer. They may use one of several sign languages, which are appropriate in different circumstances. They will be encouraged to use written and oral English. Schools have different approaches to teaching deaf children, so it is necessary for an LEA and the funding agency—or for the funding agency, should it later have sole responsibility—to ensure that there are sufficient "appropriate" places for children with communication difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the use of information technology one way of establishing integration for hearing impaired children? One important role for LEAs is to develop programmes which can be applied in a range of schools to allow deaf or hearing impaired children to take a place in a mainstream school. Such programmes would be appropriate, but does my hon. Friend agree that they may be undermined by the changes the Bill will bring about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It would be appropriate for LEAs to provide a range of services to ensure that children with special education needs receive the right sort of education and school place. There is a problem with the Bill, because a grant-maintained school catering for special needs children will be unable to buy such services from the LEA in a couple of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should emphasise that grant-maintained schools will be prohibited from purchasing certain services from LEAs in two years' time. Grant-maintained schools will be deprived of the essential and excellent services provided by LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to talk about this issue at length as we shall have the opportunity to discuss it and to try to make amendments when we come to the appropriate clause. I hope that the Government will seriously consider at least exceptions to the proposed rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is a duty to provide "appropriate" school places, there is a risk that provisions will be too narrow to deal with hearing impaired children. I accept that there will be some reduced provision. Most, perhaps all, deaf children will get by despite such provision, but wider provisions would enable schools, local authorities and the funding agency to allow deaf children to take up the communication methods and approaches to learning that suit them best. Such methods could help to overcome or reduce the hearing impairment. Classroom acoustics could be improved by low ceilings, carpeting and soft furnishings. All would help deaf children. Those facilities should be available to meet their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable in some areas that many children with hearing impairments are from ethnic minorities. It is inappropriate and undesirable for children to move out of their own areas for educational places. Without the provision for appropriate places that the Opposition suggest, locally provided places are in danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the hon.

Gentleman mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ashgrove is an excellent school. South Glamorgan's service for children with transitory problems as well as those with serious hearing impairment is excellent. Learning support services for hearing impaired children are under pressure from changes made by LMS and the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Appeal Court dealt with the case of Birmingham city council and its provision of selective school places for girls and boys. The provision of appropriate places was the main issue of the case. When the LEA considered places for girls and boys in selective schools in Birmingham, it did not take grant-maintined Handsworth boys grammar school into account because it was not responsible for that school. Lords Justice Neill, Woolf and Butler-Sloss ruled otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case raises some interesting points not only for grant-maintained schools and the funding authority, but for independent schools. The Appeal Court judged that grant-maintained schools had to be considered part of the local education authority's school places provision when school places were apportioned to boys and girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The judgment might also apply to independent schools where places are provided under the assisted places scheme. The judges decided that section 8 of the 1944 Act referred not simply to school places provided by the local education authority, but to any school places within the local authority area. The 	<i>Birmingham Post</i> reported on 15 October 1992 that the Lords Justices, noted in their judgment that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a White Paper on education, Choice and Diversity, a New Framework for Schools, presented to Parliament in July, made no reference to the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act."</p></blockquote>
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court said amendments should be introduced to stop discrimination and asked for the Government to take action."</p></blockquote>
That is important for the issue of appropriate provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are discussing an amendment on the provision of appropriate school places, it is right that the decision of the Appeal Court judges should be considered. I hope that the Government will say what steps will be taken, either to insert such a provision in the Bill or to add something to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Given that the judges considered, in their judgment, that local education authorities have problems in applying the 1975 Act, it seems appropriate for the Government to tackle the problem in the Bill. If they are not going to tackle it, does it mean that they intend to turn a blind eye to the judgment made in the Court of Appeal? I hope that the Minister will deal with those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Bridgend. His comments were of considerable importance. He was right to draw the Committee's attention to the possible inconsistencies—to use his words
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
—between the Bill and the Education Act 1944. He highlighted the inconsistencies with enormous skill and I congratulate him on the way in which he maintained the full interest of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the word "appropriate". On that point, I part company with him. He might be reassured by what my hon. Friend the Minister will say. I shall confine myself to the hon. Gentleman's point about the Education Act 1944. He referred to sections 7 and 8 and I shall refer to only section 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) when she introduced a series of amendments. She said that clause 7 was one of the key clauses. I believe that she was right to identify it as such. Clause 7, with schedule 2, provides for a sensible distribution of responsibilities between the FAS and the LEAs in areas where there are a substantial number of grant-maintained schools. I believe that it will mark a significant change in how school provision has been planned, certainly since the Butler Act of 1944.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree that the time has come when we should re-examine those sections of the 1944 Act which gave local education authorities the central role in the provision of education. The hon. Member for Hemsworth also touched on that point, although perhaps in a different sense. In one of his stimulating speeches—I realise that I must not quote his remarks, Mr. Martin—he referred to the current powers of the Secretary of State and suggested a repeal of certain elements of the 1944 Act. The hon. Gentleman's sagacity, intuition and how he sees such matters is to be commended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Awesome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that we are staggered by those awesome powers. All such reasonable descriptions might be applied, with strength and honesty, to the hon. Gentleman who, I am sure, would not disagree with anything that I have said so far. Would he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not challenging the hon. Gentleman. I am grateful to him. Sagacious, indeed I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only thing that we do not know about the hon. Gentleman is whether he can sing and dance. Perhaps we shall discover that as the evening proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand section 1 of the 1944 Act, it places a duty on the Secretary of State. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to secure the effective execution by local authorities, under his control and direction, of the national policy for providing a … comprehensive educational service in every area."</p></blockquote>
Section 7 places a duty on the local education authority itself:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to contribute towards the spiritual, moral, mental, and physical development of the community by securing that efficient education … shall be available to meet the needs of the population of their area."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister would agree with my forecast. The local management of schools operates throughout all LEA areas and there is a large and increasing number of grant-maintained schools. We heard the various estimates that my hon. Friend gave the Committee. I am one of those who believe that we shall see an avalanche of applications. I look forward to the majority of secondary schools in England and Wales becoming grant maintained during the lifetime of this Parliament. That seems to be a reasonable forecast, but time will tell. It is something that I believe that I shall see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "within the lifetime of this Parliament" always intrigues me. Does that mean until the Queen's speech at about this time next year or for the length of time for which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem inappropriate for LEAs to retain the exclusive role that was given to them under the 1944 Act. The Bill provides an opportunity to examine afresh the sections which, as the hon. Member for Bridgend said, conflict with the Bill. We should look for a new statement on how the schools system should be organised. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider how best to recognise that dilemma and the key roles that will increasingly be played by schools themselves and governing bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like some clarification because, unlike my hon. Friend, I have not had the opportunity to study the 1944 Act. In the section that my hon. Friend quoted was a reference to the duty to provide a comprehensive education. Purely as a matter of information—I say that in all seriousness—how does my hon. Friend interpret that term, especially in the light of any changes in education that have occurred—for example, choice and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not interpret it in the sense of providing one type of school.

The quality of education in the Warwickshire local education authority did not pick up until the Labour party took over. Tables on the amount of money spent or on anything else will verify my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the choice that parents in his constituency have to send their children to many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
different schools—grammar schools, bilateral schools and even secondary modern schools. What choice have parents in Rugby and Kenilworth to send their children to Rugby school, Lawrence Sheriff school or Rugby high school for girls? How can parents exercise their choice and get what they want?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned that she has three children. My wife and I have six children and I am happy to advise the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) that five of my six sons went to Lawrence Sheriff school. If my children can manage that, it suggests that that is relatively easy. The hon. Lady implied that education in Warwickshire was good only when it was under the control of the Labour party. She knows that that is absolute CRAP. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I should explain that CRAP stands for complete rubbish and piffle. Although you may think so, Mr. Martin, I am not straying from the point. The tables show how good some of those Warwickshire schools are. One of the schools to which the hon.

However, Rugby school is not administered by the local education authority. It is one of our great public schools; it is a splendid school. That excellent local journal, the 	<i>Rugby Advertiser,</i> quoted the spokesman of Rugby school who said that there was an error in the figures. He admitted that the error was not made by the Department for Education but arose from a misunderstanding of statistics.

I was about to draw my remarks to a close to allow the Committee to benefit from the words of Opposition Members. We are worried about the way in which the Bill will mesh with the 1944 Act. Serious inconsistencies have been highlighted—I thank the hon. Member for Bridgend for that. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take account of the points that we have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on his maiden speech! It was given with great elan, considerable wit and he drew out attention to some very important points. It took courage to stand up against the Government and to criticise them; I congratulate him on that especially. I am sure that he will prove to be a useful member of his party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also take the hint that the hon. Gentleman dropped about the problem in the clause. Rugby school provides an analogy of what is about to happen to grant-maintained schools. It was founded for the sons of the poor, but it scarcely fits that category now; it is for the sons, and occasionally the daughters, of the rich. The Bill should be seen in conjunction with the 1944 Act to ensure education for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of the funding agency is unclear, particularly in relation to the 1944 Act and to local education authorities. It is not only Labour LEAs that are concerned. In north Yorkshire, which is scarcely the
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
heartland of socialism, the LEA has misgivings about how it will work with the funding agency and how they will co-operate with each other. North Yorkshire is a strategic planning authority which has an immediate and in-depth input in the education committee. That is crucial. The funding agency will not have such instant knowledge. Someone can serve on both a planning committee and an education committee, but someone of that expertise is unlikely to be on the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to worry the invisible figures in the Department for Education, but the exception will be if they are made redundant. Some of the functions currently performed by the Department for Education will be performed by the funding agency. Will people made redundant at the Department for Education work as full-time officials for the funding agency? As we have demonstrated, it will control great bags of money in order to bribe people to move into the grant-maintained sector. I do not complain about that. That is natural. If the Government wish to launch successfully grant-maintained schools, they will provide plenty of money to tempt people out on that primrose path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With due deference to officials of the Department for Education—I think that they are splendid, incomparable good and brave people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I did not jump in a little earlier, but I feel that my hon. Friend may have been slighting the memory of Disraeli in referring to a primrose path. Disraeli was a one-nation Tory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely accept my hon. Friend's strictures. Can we any longer speak of one-nation Tories after witnessing the filibuster that took place this afternoon in the Chamber?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some officials from the Department for Education will clearly work for the funding agency. They will not be aware of the susceptibilities of different localities. For example, apart from the evidence given by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, they will not know of the nuances of that area. I do not know them so I should not dream of pronouncing on what should happen there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency will be working with the local education authority there and advising it. What will be the relationship between the two? Will the funding agency be in a superior position or will there be a genuine partnership? What sort of co-operation will exist and how will that be assured? Those are difficult questions which the Minister must study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a premature transfer to the funding agency, it will have incalculable consequences for students. We must consider the long-term aims for students in a given area, and that includes those students as yet unborn. We must take account of demographic trends. Looking forward is a long process but, as the Minister outlined, decisions on the grant-maintained schools will be taken by one generation—the pupils currently in a school and their parents. That makes long-term planning incredibly difficult, so we need efficient and effective co-ordination with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will co-ordination be achieved? What steps have been taken and what training has been given? What consideration has been given to the current role and knowledge of the local authority? As the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth rightly asked, what proper examination has been made of local authorities' requirements under the 1944 Act? How will those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
requirements pass to the funding agency? How will the funding agency, in co-operation with the local authority, effectively perform its necessary duties without wasting resources that should go to the pupils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say wasting resources because, during its early stages, the funding agency will be over-resourced. Many of us have come across the year on, year the granting of money in LEAs. By the end of the year the local authority is faced with an amount of money that it has not spent and it looks around for something to spend it on—often very nice things, but not necessarily a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have several campaigns in common. I am delighted that he supports the plain English campaign. Perhaps he will also support a campaign that I support, which wants to move away from the year-on-year concept of funding. I think that concept is damaging and we should move away from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has joined my campaign, which I first started in 1974. I welcome him to it. Membership of the campaign is a mere 50p a year—I shall ask for his money afterwards. No accounts are available. If the funding agency has a dominant position it needs to make long-term decisions, which means that it should be funded long term. The Bill makes that very difficult, if not impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned about the Bill's provision for special needs. The issues of truancy and attendance are bound up with the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, there are pupils who have emotional problems and, to put it crudely, there are those who make a damn nuisance of themselves at school and are disruptive in class. With the race to reach the top of the league table, schools will take the easy path of expelling such pupils. Grant-maintained schools can expel them much more easily than schools that stay within the LEA. Taking that action produces two results—it makes the school's exam results better because, on the whole, disruptive pupils are not those who perform well; and it makes its attendance records better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are special—indeed, costly—ways of dealing with such disruptive pupils, but within a local school budget that is difficult to provide. For example, a school might be in a socially deprived area in an inner city, where there is a high concentration of unemployment and people have almost got out of the habit of working. They pass that attitude on to their children, which results in real difficulties in school attendance, in behaviour and in attempts to raise standards. That special need is not often examined. Indeed, some of the money spent on publicising the Bill and the various citizens charters might have been better spent on a serious study of the problems of inner-city schools. As I said, the difficulty is associated not only with inner-city schools, but with generally deprived areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman does grant-maintained schools a disservice in assuming that all such schools in inner-city areas will have attendance problems. One of the great successes of grant-maintained schools is that they have been able to inculcate in parents and the local community a feeling of investment in them. The result has been an improvement in truancy and attendance rates. For example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
Birmingham's Small Heath school in the middle of what was the constituency of Lord Howell had an attendance rate of 86 per cent, in 1988. Four years later, after three years of grant-maintained status, that figure is 93 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly easy to achieve such an improvement and I shall tell the hon. Gentleman how. When we looked at the problems of absence at St. Wilfrid's, where I taught for a long time, we knew that we could solve them by getting rid of or suspending certain children. That is very easy. An examination of attendance records—and the way in which some very good schools still cover up those records to make them look better than they really are—will show that a great disservice is being done to the most difficult children to educate. They are simply being cast aside and the real problem is ignored. The DFE must attend to that problem fairly urgently because it is getting worse. If the Minister disagrees with me I hope that he will say so. All the evidence from local education authorities shows that the problem of disruption is becoming more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the consultation paper that I issued yesterday on the subject of exclusions and the £10 million allocated by the Secretary of State to deal with the problem of truancy. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that one of the Secretary of State's consistent themes is the seriousness with which he takes matters such as truancy, exclusions and related problems. His aim is to ensure that their impact on education is minimised and, equally importantly, that the youngsters and pupils involved are educated properly either at school or elsewhere. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman welcomes that and that he will help us to achieve our objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always delighted to help the Minister. He needs a great deal of help at the moment, especially in this matter. I know that some attention has been given to the problem. However, the Minister should acknowledge that no Government, including previous Labour Governments, have assisted local authorities in their valiant efforts to deal with the matter. Birmingham, in particular, had a considerable problem about 15 to 20 years ago and put vast local resources into examining its origins. The Birmingham authority came up with several pointers, although not instant solutions. I pay tribute to that experiment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities such as Birmingham that invest in schools so as to overcome serious attendance and behavioural problems will not be able to do so under the local management of schools, because more money will be allocated on a per capita basis. Schools that previously received money to help them to overcome problems will lose resources to schools which, because of their catchment area, are relatively more successful. During his magnificent speech, will my hon. Friend urge the Government to consider that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The league tables are not all bad, but one school in my constituency came half-way down the table for Wakefield and below the national average. It is a school whose pupils have profound social problems and its performance, in offsetting them was magnificent. As my hon. Friend said, for several years the local authority gave that school special attention and extra money, at the expense of the school where I taught. I did not object to that because that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
policy was open and enabled the school to try to combat its disadvantages. It did not conquer all its problems, that would be asking too much—paradise is the day after tomorrow, not tomorrow. It is tragic that because of the compulsory formula that school is now underfunded and has had to get rid of the five extra teachers who were employed because of the generosity of other schools in the area. I predict that that school's results will be worse in future than they are this year. Such underfunding is another issue that the funding agencies should carefully consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The amendment is clear it is about the "responsibility for providing" and "the duty to secure".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin, but I did not see you rise earlier. On the appropriateness of school places, one of the barriers to full attendance at school is that the curriculum is not attractive to some pupils. The strictures of the national curriculum make it difficult for schools to adapt it to attract those children back and give them a relevant education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Hemsworth responds to that intervention, I remind the Committee that we are discussing provision, not whether the curriculum is attractive. There are many new Members present and I appreciate that it is difficult to keep to order in Committee. However, the amendments are specific and hon. Members should not stray too far from the subject. I shall get into a lot of bother with people who read 	<i>Hansard</i> because I have let hon. Members go all over the place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin. It is true that I had left the argument implicit, rather than making it explicit, which I shall now do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 refers to clause 7, page 3, line 22, and would insert "and appropriate" after "sufficient", so that the wording would be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where he wishes responsibility for providing sufficient and appropriate school places".</p></blockquote>
The emphasis is on appropriateness—or is it "appropriety"? It follows from the elision of the duty in the 1944 Act —the need to educate according to age, aptitude and ability—that the word "appropriate" is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak about the national curriculum, but only in relation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No. We must draw in the reins a wee bit and speak to the amendment. We could discuss the national curriculum if the amendment dealt with it, but it does not. The hon. Gentleman must speak to the amendments that he tabled. That is the rule of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The appropriate school places that should be provided should allow for a curriculum that is diverse in its unity. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said that the clause demonstrated diversity. For appropriate school places, one needs diversity in unity. Under the Bill there could not be appropriate school places because the Secretary of State is far too prescriptive. I am sure that the Minister tried to persuade the Secretary of State against that course, but the Secretary of State has clearly persevered and insisted on a provision that is inappropriate. It is inappropriate to prescribe from above —from the centre—the nature of school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of those school places should be diverse, in a way that suits the individual pupil. A class is made up of 32, 28 or, in some cases, 35 individuals. No two of the pupils in a class are the same. The requirement of the curriculum is subtle. For appropriate class places, it is totally inessential to insist on having middle English taught to 15-year-olds. In south Kirby they are not all that keen on Chaucer. They do not think that he is the essence of all that should be in English literature. Like many adults and, I suspect, some Members of Parliament, they do not understand Chaucerian language. That is a serious charge to make against the Committee, but I am prepared to read a passage of Chaucer and to pick at random a Conservative member of the Committee to give us a translation. That would demonstrate that we need an appropriate syllabus for appropriate school courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South said, we should be able to examine "syllubi" when we examine appropriate school courses. I am not sure, Mr. Martin, that syllabus is second declension; it may be fourth declension, in which case it should be syllabuses. I am happy to leave myself in the hands of 	<i>Hansard</i> on this occasion. You should not understand that I am suggesting that Latin is "appropriate" for everyone with a school place, but one inappropriate result, especially in working class areas, has been the squeezing out of the classics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Classics are appropriate for certain schools. They teach literature and history of a type disapproved of by the Secretary of State—that of reform, revolution and radicalism at their best. Classics also teach English language, sentence construction, common sense, logic and geography in a way that the Secretary of State could never achieve. Such teaching is being squeezed out—that is appalling. Truant children are being expelled and not properly dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall discuss Small Heath school and appropriate places. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) commented on what it has achieved in three years, but that is what worries me about how funding agencies will work. The LEA kept its umbrella in place and that allowed Small Heath to achieve what it has. The LEA has given advice and assistance on every occasion that they were needed. The funding agency will be unable to offer the same assistance and help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be 11.40 pm, but I cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to get away with that. Small Heath school was subjected to a campaign of unprecedented vilification by Birmingham city council while trying to go grant maintained. The idea that, since then, the attitude of Birmingham city council has metamorphosised, becoming terribly helpful by providing an umbrella for Small Heath's activities, is farcical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman should react in such a way. He is impugning the integrity of Birmingham's officials. Some piffling Tory politicians may talk in one way, but Birmingham's officials, the advisers and the chief education officer have done nothing but express their willingness to assist any school in their area in any way that they can. That can be borne out by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley, who formerly led a neighbouring authority. Therefore, she can speak with authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wakefield (City) authority, in the former West Riding of Yorkshire, is prepared to help if it were appropriate, but such authorities will be shorn of so much power and money that they will be unable to help the funding agency. Small local authorities such as Wakefield (City), Calderdale and Kirkless will be extremely pushed if grant-maintained schools suddenly catch on. I doubt that they will, but the Minister should think about what would happen if they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion—you will be delighted to hear, Mr. Martin, but my peroration usually lasts for about three hours, because I am a great admirer of Demosthenes—the 1944 Act must be respected. Whatever may be said about its current appropriateness, its spirit has taken us admirably through many years, which is a tribute to a Conservative—Rab Butler. We must not, as we say in my neck of the woods, throw the baby out with the bathwater; we must ensure that the 1944 Act is integrated into the Bill and guard against the funding agencies and, as a result, schools being left out on a limb and pupils' futures being destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise to be as loquacious—if that is the word—as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth. I know that you, Mr. Martin, will appreciate that it is late and that I am a new Member for Parliament, as are many members of the Committee. I intend to stick to the amendment, and if I stray, it will be because of the lateness of the hour and my newness. I am confident that you will step in and put me right should I stray ever so slightly from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should perhaps begin by saying what I feel the amendment is about. The arrangements for securing sufficient schools have worked well for 50 years, until the introduction of grant-maintained schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend spoke about that earlier, when he described how the introduction of grant-maintained schools has prevented local authorities from closing schools down because of the fear that those schools would then choose to opt out of LEA control. That fear is real and explains why we may have, in what I think were the Minister's words, 1 million or 1·5 million surplus places. That must be unprecedented. The local authority system has worked well in regulating the supply of school places to meet the known needs of pupils in each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the new arrangements match that 50-year record of supplying appropriate and sufficient school places? The provision of school places depends on statistical information. I am very pleased that funding agencies and LEAs will not have to rely on Government statistics to ascertain whether new schools are required. Earlier today, I pointed out an exaggerated Government claim—they had claimed a sevenfold increase in opt-out ballots, which had actually increased sixfold. The Government have been shown to make mistakes, even if only in press releases, and cannot be relied on for accurate information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
Funding authorities and local education authorities will have to obtain advice, largely based on demographic information, about the need to open or close schools. The LEAs will, of course, be relied upon for that demographic information. It is important to insert "and appropriate" after "sufficient" because LEAs are starved of funds and do not have the resources to undertake research unless it is needed for statutory purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy for LEAs to supply the information that they need an extra 100 or 500 school places in certain areas. However, it is not so easy for them to specify whether those places are in the primary or secondary sector, whether they are for exceptionally bright children or for children with special educational needs, or whether they are for Church of England, Catholic or Muslim schools. Those are complex needs to ascertain and LEAs must have good resources to carry out the necessary statistical investigation and survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point, which may have escaped the Minister's attention, is that the funding agency will have no advice on curriculum, apart from the four-yearly reports from the private inspection of schools. My hon. Friends have made the point clearly that that is important for children with special educational needs. We need to know what facilities and curriculum are being provided in particular areas and whether there is likely to be a shortage for students with hearing impairments or for those whose first language is not English, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency needs all sorts of information and data to carry out properly its duty. It is important for the LEAs to have adequate resources to carry out their detailed investigation and work. I am worried that if the word "appropriate" is not enshrined in the Bill, the LEAs will simply not have the necessary resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs have detailed local knowledge, whereas the funding agency, as has been pointed out often, does not and so may have to collect rather more information than if the LEA were in the primary position of making provision for children in the area. I am worried, also, about the rather disturbing vagueness regarding the way in which the funding agency and the LEA are given responsibility for providing places. Paragraph 3.18 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will need to be a point at which the Funding Agency takes on some responsibility for securing sufficient, suitable school places in the areas of individual LEAs … where more than 10 per cent, of primary or secondary school pupils in an LEA are educated in GM schools, the LEA and the Funding Agency will both be under a duty to exercise their functions to the extent necessary to secure the provision of sufficient places."</p></blockquote>
That is not very clear. We had hoped that the Secretary of State would clarify that on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the number of grant-maintained schools grows, the funding agrncy will take on a parallel duty to ensure an adequate number of school places".</p></blockquote>
He said that in all but the most Luddite of local education authorities, he expected that there would be sensible proposals to deal with the need for more school places He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be two bodies—the LEA and the funding agency—with parallel but not shared responsibilities. A little healthy competition will be no bad thing". 	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 634–5.]</p></blockquote>
Where does that leave us? The White Paper refers to the local education authority and the funding agency
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
exercising their functions, while on Second Reading the Secretary of State talked about "parallel but not shared" responsibilities. Clause 7 refers to the funding authority holding responsibility as well as the local education authority, while schedule 2 sets out the specific arrangements. Part II of schedule 2 is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Functions Where Responsibility For Providing Sufficient School Places Is Shared".</p></blockquote>
Was the Secretary of State correct on Second Reading? There seems to be an element of confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the problem of sharing powers. It is not clear, despite the Minister's previous remarks, how two independent organisations can share a duty of this nature. There must be relatively few precedents for that, and fewer still cases in which the arrangements have been so successful as to serve as a model of good administration. I hope that the Minister will provide further clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression "parallel responsibilities" must be evaluated in the light of the Government's almost total control of major capital projects. We have already heard that the funding agency will be given a disproportionate capital spending allocation and that in their intended role, local education authorities may well concentrate on much less popular activities such as removing surplus places and closing schools. That would be an unfortunate way forward, which the Opposition would regret and which would hasten the demise of local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fears are heightened because of the difference in wording between section 8 of the 1944 Act and clause 7 and schedule 2. The amendments highlight the difference in wording between the 1944 Act and the Bill. Clause 7(1)(a) uses the phrase "responsibility for providing", whereas section 8 of the 1944 Act refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the duty of every local education authority to secure".</p></blockquote>
Clause 7(1)(a) refers to "school places" whereas section 8 of the Act refers to "schools". Amendment No. 161 would redress the balance in that instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be collaboration between the funding agency and the local education authority, whether the
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
responsibility is intended to be shared or held in parallel. The former implies co-operation, while the latter implies a frosty non-communication. Children's needs for school places will best be secured through collaboration, a term used by the Secretary of State. Collaboration implies partnership which, in turn, implies some element of mutual respect for the roles and rights of each partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that part II of schedule 2, which is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Functions where responsibility for providing sufficient school places is shared"</p></blockquote>
should include paragraph 3(1). That paragraph could be equally applicable if the funding authority had sole responsibility. There is no mention of the duties or the role of the LEA nor of any need to consult or co-operate with it. Instead, in the event of there being insufficient school places, the paragraph states boldly that the funding authority shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"publish proposals for the establishment, alteration and discontinuance of schools."</p></blockquote>
Those proposals would be published regardless of any plans that the LEA may have to deal with that insufficiency. Where does the sharing come? The wording of that paragraph will not encourage collaboration and co-operation, but confrontation and chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider the shift of responsibility to the funding agency after the 75 per cent, point has been reached. That will place those schools that choose to remain with the LEA in a difficult position. The ability of the LEA to support those schools would depend on a level playing field, especially with regard to capital expenditure on repairs and improvements. We have heard that it is unlikely that such a level playing field will be provided. The LEA's ability to operate will also depend on the willingness of the funding agency to allow popular LEA schools to thrive.
