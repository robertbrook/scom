<p><i>Amdt. moved [23 June]:</i> No. 25, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(IZC) Arrangements shall only be made by virtue of this section where the relevant authority is satisfied that the views of any person to be placed in accommodation have been taken into account.'.—<i>[Mr. Rooker.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was on my feet at our last sitting, having formally moved amendment No. 25. I want to add a few words on that important subject. However, so that it is on record to ensure that the Minister and Whip have no fears and to show that my word is my bond, my hon. Friends and I will ensure that the Committee stage is concluded this morning.<br><br>
The key issue about consultation is users' views. The amendment is narrowly drafted. Sometimes one cannot separate the user—the person who wants or needs care—from the carer who has been involved. That is one of the great issues that was tackled by the Select Committee. If the users' views are to be taken into account, they must be informed views, based on knowledge of the alternatives and options available for a particular person. Those people must therefore have the choice, if possible—and every case must be examined—of continuing to live independently in their own homes. That is the first option that should be available for people and it should be fully explored before they are moved to residential care of any description.<br><br>
People may not appreciate the options and range of facilities that are available. There lies the dilemma between giving the user choice and independence, a paradox that was explored in the Social Services Select Committee's sixth report, way back in May 1980. That was a special report on choice for service users as part of the community care programme. It made 17 recommendations, most of which will be accepted by local authorities. The Government have shown their support for many of those points, though not all, because one of them referred to sections 1 to 3 of the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986.<br><br>
However, choice must be informed. Information, therefore, must be available. I do not want to discuss information services, but there can be no choice unless information is available. It is incumbent on the local authority involved, as the lead agency—until the Government takes that role away—to provide information on what is available in its area. I do not want to plug my local authority, the biggest in England, too much but late last year it produced a substantial information file and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
guide to care in the community. It had chapters on money, housing, health, help in the neighbourhood and at home, getting out and about and leisure. It is a mine of information about contacts in the public, private and voluntary sectors. Many people, when they come to require care, will not have had the opportunity to plan for it. They are given no option and decisions are sometimes made quickly. That is a tragedy. I suspect that most members of the Committee have come across cases of people in residential accommodation who should not be there. When my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) was busy with the closure of 17 homes in the Leeds area, I expect that he came across examples, as I have in my constituency when homes have been closed or amalgamated. When that happens, there is an assessment of every person living in a home. It is rare not to come across one case about whom, after the assessment, the social services department asks why that person was in the home in the first place. Sometimes it results from a lack of information available to the carers and the person concerned.<br><br>
Every local authority should ensure that there is as much information as possible available on the situation in the area. That is a departure for many local authorities. They are not used to advertising, like the private sector, or to working closely with the voluntary sector. Birmingham has given a lead, with its wide dissemination of information that I hope others will follow.<br><br>
When the choice is made between independence and residential care, it is not just the services that the user requires at home that should be considered. I have to be careful how I put this point because I could be misunderstood by some of my friends in the trade union movement. The first priority is the user. To gain maximum independence it is always preferable to provide aids and adaptations. For example, flexibility in the kitchen would enable people to make a choice to cook their own meals rather than receive a meals-on-wheels service. To be able to do things for themselves gives independence; to rely on services leads to a degree of dependence.<br><br>
People have to be informed about the range of adaptations and aids available so that they can, without going into care, have their homes converted using modern technology, such as movable sinks and worktops to accommodate wheelchairs. People do not appreciate what is available because it is not the sort of thing that one shops around for. By the time the aids are needed, people might not be physically able to shop around. That is why it is crucial that the care managers or the social services go out of their way to provide maximum information so that informed choices can be made. I can do no better than to quote the Association of County Councils document, published this year, on care in the community which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"the establishment of an effective user and carer-centred perspective also demands that actual and potential users and carers are informed of what services are available."</p></blockquote>
That is the climate at the moment. I hope that the Government will seek to perpetuate it, so that people are given a genuine choice.<br><br>
By the time that an assessment is necessary, it is likely that the assessment will lead to residential care—for the majority of cases at a low level, such as the narrow type of housing dealt with in the Bill. Nevertheless, as a later amendment will make clear, choice has to include the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
possibility of deciding that the move has not worked out. I do not want to go into that aspect yet, because we shall deal with the issue of trial periods shortly.<br><br>
The Government probably do not want to amend the Bill. I hope, however that they will make the right noises and accept that choice has to be based on information. I hope that they will do what they can to encourage local authorities to maximise the amount of information available.<br><br>
I read some of the draft community care plans last year. I do not wish to single any of them out, but I am not happy with one or two of them because they do not intend to maximise the information available from all sectors. There will be a cultural change in the way in which social services departments operate from next April. Some of them are moving in that direction now. They will genuinely see themselves as the enablers, planners and organisers, and they must provide the user with information so that he can make an informed choice. No one else can take that role. Only local government can collate, publish and disseminate the information to GPs, carers and potential users.<br><br>
Even insurance companies are moving into this field by encouraging people to plan for possible future care costs and arrangements. Previous and present generations never planned to be in care. No one planned for that, or made arrangements, so there was no demand for information. Now there is such a demand, and I hope that it will help match the carer to the services in a much better way than before. If people are able to make those choices, it is less likely that they will end up in the wrong kind of care in the wrong part of the country. That point cannot be overstated. We shall constantly return to this matter as the implementation of these measures—next April, we hope—comes closer, and from then onwards. It will be crucial because, as Members of Parliament, we shall be involved at the sharp end when things go wrong. We are like firefighters, usually called in when it is too late. Our job is to encourage the services to provide information so that people do not feel the need to call on firefighters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in my hon. Friend's reference to the information file in Birmingham. It is a commendable document. I have read a good deal about this matter. Is he aware that it was initiated by our hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Ms. Jowell) in her previous existence?<br><br>
Has my hon. Friend any remarks to make about the care plans for "Irewash."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is pronounced "Earwash"!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been through a pronunciation exercise this morning!<br><br>
I was aware—I have to be careful what I say—that my hon. Friend has guided, been a mentor to and transformed the culture and climate in Birmingham social services department. I cannot put it in any other way because that is the significance of the changes made since my hon. Friend paid her visits to Birmingham. I have one small criticism—I do not want to say that everything is rosy. There is no mention of the independent living fund, even in the money section of the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. HinchlifTe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is being scrapped.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. When I was drafting a policy statement about community care I read the document and I thought that the ILF had a valuable role to play.<br><br>
So far as "Irewash" is concerned—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Earwash".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give notice now in the most gentle way that on Report next week we will make it clear that, although we appreciate the fact that the Government have taken this important legislation so seriously, during the Committee proceedings no Conservative member of the Committee contributed to the debate. We give due warning that we shall seek to speak for their constituencies next week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) is wrong; we have had one contribution from the Conservative Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we noted that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 25 is about choice. I am grateful for the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr about consultation. Do users and carers really have a choice? It is important that both are consulted. It is important that residential care is not seen as a last resort when there is nowhere else to go. It must be a positive choice made by the user, the carer and, ideally, the care manager who helps to put the care package together.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am concerned that people will not have a proper choice. The community care legislation and various local authority care plans contain very fine words such as "dignity", "freedom", "independence", "residential users' rights" and "choice". Choice seems to feature in every such document that I have read. But how real can that choice be against a fixed budget background? To give people real choice implies that a number of options is available. Or will people be able to choose only what a local authority has on offer? Neighbouring authorities might offer totally different choices. The local authority in which the person resides may offer a very limited choice. People may have a limited choice if they reside in a Tory authority that spends very little on its personal social services, whereas a neighbouring Labour-controlled authority will obviously provide a wider choice.<br><br>
If budgets are to be delegated down from senior management to care managers and social workers who help to put together care packages, and if those budgets are fixed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The question before the Committee is consultation, not budgets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that advice, Mr. McWilliam. I am trying to illustrate the point that proper consultation should mean choice for carers and users. Therefore, we must talk about budgets to establish whether people will have a real choice. There should be a purpose to consultation: it should not simply be a process to be gone through as a matter of course.<br><br>
If care managers have a fixed budget, can they offer people choice? For example—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I can help the hon. Gentleman, he can usefully make this point in the debate on amendment No. 28, but not in this one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If people choose residential care when they are consulted, the care manager may, unfortunately, suggest home care as a cheaper option. The user may say, "I'm sorry, but my positive choice after our consultation is residential care." The care manager's response might be, "Unfortunately, residential care is too expensive and I can't manage it within my budget. Instead I shall have to provide home help and cleaning services." It is difficult to see how proper choice can be offered to people during the consultation process so that they can make positive choices. I do not understand how that can be done on a fixed budget—there is no doubt that there will be a fixed budget. Although the amendment is not really about money and budgets, its background makes it difficult to divorce the two issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I help the hon. Member? Some of the points that he wishes to make may be raised in connection with amendment No. 28 and some during the clause stand part debate on clause 1. Amendment No. 25 is extremely narrow in that it assumes that a person is to be placed in accommodation. The consultation relates to that point, not to whether or not to place him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for reminding me of that.<br><br>
It is very important that the authority is satisfied that the views of any person to be placed in accommodation have been taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has come up against the narrowness of the amendment. Bearing in mind his wide experience, he should put it to the Committee that the amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the relevant authority is satisfied that the views of any person".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the authority must create a mechanism for making sure that views are taken into account. That mechanism must include checking that the person knew about alternatives, costs and charges. My hon. Friend could usefully deploy that mechanism. If there is no mechanism, it will not be possible to take negative views into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr for that intervention. He is absolutely right. Those are exactly the points that I was trying to make.<br><br>
If the Government are serious about offering real choice—I sincerely hope that they are, and I expect that they were when the legislation was first proposed—and if local authorities are sincere about offering choice, the Minister must make clear the Government's commitment to proper funding to implement the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is probably remiss of me, but we have not had a full debate on clause 1. We have dealt only with the amendments. I intend to allow a clause stand part debate, and if any hon. Member wants to make wider points he or she can do so then, rather than during discussion of a group of narrow amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep to amendment No. 25, but the amendment relates to the views of the person to be placed in accommodation, therefore we are discussing the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
right to choose. Freedom of choice is a crucial part of the amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the views of people who may be placed in Abbeyfield society accommodation, or other accommodation, will be ascertained. They will be asked whether they wish to go into that accommodation or whether they would prefer another alternative being offered by the local authority.<br><br>
It is difficult to accept the way in which the Government use the term "freedom of choice" in relation to community care. They have suggested that the advent of income support payments to elderly people to support them in private care homes has given many thousands of people great freedom of choice which had previously been denied to people with insufficient income to exercise purchase of care in that way. The argument is that, since 1981, the extension of income support payments has given people a range of choice previously denied them. In reality, the exercise of the freedom of choice to which the Government refer is a sham and a myth. I shall explain my reasons for saying that, because they are central to our argument for amendment No. 25.<br><br>
After 25 years of direct or indirect involvement in social work, I have yet to meet one elderly person who has made a positive choice to enter institutional care when that person had a range of alternatives. I do not say that people do not positively choose to enter institutional care, but I have never met someone who has positively chosen to enter residential or nursing care when that person has had a genuine choice of alternative domiciliary services. It is nonsense to talk about freedom of choice for the elderly. That is why amendment No. 25 is necessary.<br><br>
For most people considering entering care, the choice is between the same form of care from a range of establishments. The choice that the Government offer is narrow; it is a choice, by and large, or one form of care—institutional care in a care home or a nursing home. That is not freedom of choice. That implies a wider choice from among a range of services and alternative forms of care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that he did not know of cases in which people have chosen residential care. I agree that it is unusual—it is a product of circumstances rather than choice—but I know of one such case. My hon. Friend would agree that sometimes it can be a positive choice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. However, I must have dealt with hundreds of people, but I have yet to meet one person who positively chose to enter care when there was a range of choices. The amendment is necessary because of the way in which the Government's community care policy has narrowed the range of choices.<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, Government investment in care has primarily involved pumping money into income support payments for institutional care. Local authorities have had their ability to expand alternatives to institutional care reduced by standard spending assessments, rate and poll tax capping and other Government measures. Alternatives to institutional care, such as domiciliary, home care and respite services and sheltered or very sheltered accommodation, which enabled people who so chose to remain in the community, have, in many areas, been reduced. People should have a right to choose alternatives to institutional provision.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
The point that undermines the Government's argument about freedom of choice is that, if people are to choose to enter care, they must consider the availability of such care in their area. That implies that there are vacancies. Many people, unfortunately, have to move many miles from where they have lived all their lives and are shunted 10,20, 30 or 40 miles into institutional care in the private sector because nothing is available in their locality. It is bad to move people from their areas. That is not community care in my book. Choice implies that there are vacancies. The only way to make an informed choice is to know where there are vacancies.<br><br>
Vacancies are often few and far between, and choice is limited to homes with vacancies. If the Government genuinely believe in choice and the use of the private sector—I have heard this argued by people in the private sector—they should be prepared to fund vacancies in those care homes or local authority homes. They should meet the loss of income by keeping places vacant. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister, if he believes in freedom of choice, intends to do that, so that people can have a genuine choice at local level.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The other myth about freedom of choice is the belief that residents or potential residents exercise choice themselves. In my experience, Residents often have no involvement in exercising freedom of choice. That freedom is exercised on their behalf by somebody else, and that may not always be someone who has their best interests at heart. I have come across cases where the people acting on behalf of elderly relatives who were unable to exercise their own choice did not have their best interests at heart. I accept that those might be exceptional cases, but they happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Ann Coffey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of my constituents, who has just received an eviction notice from a nursing home because neither she nor her relatives are able to afford the increased nursing charges, has absolutely no choice whatever because she does not have finance available to her?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, it is interesting that she should raise the issue of eviction. The Minister said that there was no real evidence of evictions. I understand that my hon. Friend has a letter, which the Minister may like to study, relating to an elderly woman who will be evicted from a care home in Stockport in the next few weeks. Similar evidence has come to us from a number of sources. The Minister should take that problem seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This point properly arises not under this amendment but amendment No. 28.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a reputation for distracting one from the central point. I shall follow your guidance, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
To reiterate the point that I made on Second Reading—the Minister understands it, even if he does not agree—the Government's community care policies have narrowed choice. It is nonsense to suggest that the assessment programme, if it actually happens in April 1993, will assist the process of choice. The Minister is deluding himself if he believes that, after that date, the problem will be resolved. Regardless of the financial question, what genuine choice does the person making the assessments have if there is no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
other option but to place people in care? I know of areas, including my own, where insufficient funding and support for domiciliary care services makes it impossible genuinely to offer an alternative to institutional care.<br><br>
I am worried that the huge explosion in institutional care that we have seen under the Government has altered people's perception of what the elderly need and require. There are care homes here, there and everywhere. "Errorwash" is full of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is pronounced "Earwash."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Lady wishes to address the Committee she should intervene on the hon. Gentleman and not do so from a sendentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not now able to have a go at the hon. Member for Erewash for not participating in the Committee. She has made a valid and relevant comment. I congratulate her. I have lost track of what I was saying.<br><br>
I was saying that by their policies the Government have narrowed the choices. I appreciate that I cannot stray too far from the amendment, but we need to continue to restate that it is crucial that the changes in April 1993 result in massive public investment in the expansion of domiciliary alternatives to institutional care. Whether in the private, public or voluntary sectors, we need that expansion desperately. The Minister must concentrate on that. It is the only way to offer the choice that should be afforded to those people who will be affected by the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) made a valid point, although you felt it necessary to interrupt him on several occasions, Mr. McWilliam. He implied that the public's perception of the response to the problem of elderly people is to dump them in institutional care and place them away from society. The way in which we continue to deal with the problem is profoundly wrong in terms of human rights.<br><br>
We should compare the treatment that we allow our elderly to receive under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 with the treatment of children and young persons under the Children Act 1989. The legal rights of children and young persons are taken seriously. We denigrate our elderly people because we do not provide them with the rights that we believe young people and children should have. It is profoundly wrong that our social policy is so ageist. The Government are guilty of ageism in their policies for the elderly.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept this entirely reasonable amendment and that he will realise that our motives are honourable. It would assist the operation of the legislation if he were to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Tim Yeo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the opening remarks of the hon. Member for Perry Barr about concluding the proceedings of the Committee by 1 pm today. I am sure that we all agree that 10 hours of debate on a Bill with one substantive clause is generous. We have covered every possible angle, and, with your generosity, Mr. McWilliam, one or two tangential angles.<br><br>
I also welcome the hon. Gentleman's remarks on moving the amendment. I agree about the importance of taking into account the views of individuals before they are placed in residential accommodation, and of good information which is an essential prerequisite if individuals views are to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
be well informed and based on a knowledge of available options. Those options, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, are not just between one residential home or another; they go further upsteam. People should know about extra domiciliary services, home adaptations and so on.<br><br>
We want to ensure that such information is available, so that choices made by individuals are as well informed as they possibly can be. In furtherance of that, we have funded the Policy Studies Institute to produce practical guidelines for local authorities on how to develop an information policy, and, within the social services setting, how to put that policy into effect. We shall publish those guidelines later in the year.<br><br>
I hope that Opposition Members recognise the importance of local authorities ensuring that the choices available include the increasing options in the private sector. I must emphasise that I am not thinking only of residential care. The private sector will increasingly be a player in the provision of domiciliary services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister presumably accepts that the private sector's predominant interest in care has been in making profits through the provision of institutional care. If the Minister is considering the development of alternatives involving the private sector in domiciliary services—I have said that we need to consider all sectors for such provison—how will he ensure that such private organisations are properly checked and monitored at local level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. We shall want to consider the way in which private operators of domiciliary services are monitored as that activity builds up. Just as private residential homes are currently subject to rigorous inspection, so we must consider what would be appropriate for domiciliary service. I am anxious that we do not kill off the good by demanding standards that are attainable only by the best. There is a risk of over-regulation leading to such high standards being required that many competent, satisfactory and ethical activities are prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point. I am not implying that we should apply standards that would prevent people from becoming involved in such activity. We are discussing the basics. What assurances can the hon. Gentleman give, if he is actively encouraging private sector involvement in, for example, domiciliary care provision, that police checks will be undertaken on people who offer personal care in people's homes? Often such people are involved in handling elderly people's money. There are at present limited powers to check on people employed by private organisations. There are already examples of bad practice and other problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to the amendment, but one of the best safeguards against private sector malpractice is that people and, in particular, local authorities are not compelled to use the private sector unless they are satisfied with its standards.<br><br>
I am anxious about the will of some local authorities genuinely to promote freedom of choice because of their reluctance to involve the private sector in consultations about the formation of community care plans. I know, for example, that Derbyshire county council social services dept—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Erewash.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—has caused concern in the private sector. My anxiety is much allayed because of the vigilant scrutiny that my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash will maintain in coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does she not tell us about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are doing their best to provoke my hon. Friends into speaking. I know that many of my hon. Friends will be only too keen to do so on Report. My hon. Friend the Member for Berkshire, East (Mr. MacKay) will welcome my drawing my hon. Friends' attention to the fact that that is an open-ended debate. There will be plenty of opportunities for those who feel that they have been provoked by Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is not on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned Derbyshire and, in particular, the constituency of his hon. Friend the Member for Erewash. In discussing the developing involvement of the private sector, could the Minister advise the Committee how it is possible to operate a policy which is operating in a Conservative-controlled London authority, under which in cases that are referred for home care—the old home help service—a decision is made whether a person requires a cleaning or a caring service? If a person requires a caring service, the local authority directly provides a home carer. If a person requires a cleaner, the cleaner comes from a private agency and is employed, presumably, on the lines along which the Minister would like such services to develop. How, at 9 am on a Monday morning, is it possible for a home care organiser to know whether Mrs. Smith needs care or cleaning help? That is the sort of nonsensical policy that is being developed by a Conservative-controlled authority. How does the Minister justify that arrangement? Authorities such as Derbyshire are reluctant to become involved with the private sector because such issues are raised. The hon. Member with a Derbyshire constituency may wish to comment on that.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to an unnamed London authority, but that example goes to the heart of our intention. We wish to involve the service user in decisions about the nature of the service provided. I can imagine cases in which a user might wish to have a carer one week, if his or her children were away on holiday and no close family member would be visiting, and a cleaner another week if he or she had received several visitors at the weekend. It is a curious idea that it is wrong for local authorities to try to reflect the needs of individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hinchliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich has reminded me that that London borough was Bromley. If a cleaner from a private agency is sent to someone's home and finds the person in need of skilled care, perhaps because the person became ill during the night or had a fall, what should the cleaner do? In domiciliary care, it is nonsense to differentiate between someone who does the dusting and someone who does the caring.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the problem seems to have solved itself. It will not matter, in the case of Bromley, whether it sends the cleaner or the carer if they can both do either job, as the hon. Member for Wakefield suggests. I should try to make progress, because I am conscious of the commitment of the hon. Member for Perry Bar to completing the proceedings.<br><br>
I am not sure how easily I can reconcile the concern about freedom of choice that was expressed today with the attitude that was expressed on Tuesday by some hon. Members who seemed to want to deny individuals the right and freedom to choose to spend their own money. That is a little ironic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a gross distortion of what Opposition Members were arguing. No one was suggesting that people should be denied the right to spend their money as they wish. We were simply arguing that the service provided to residents in establishments covered by the Bill should be of the same quality for those who are supported out of public funds as for those who are paying their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have already had that debate. We shall return to it on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 46 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 requires local authorities to consult representatives of users and their carers when they draw up community care plans. In our policy guidance, "Caring for People—Community Care in the Next Decade and Beyond," we make it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>"individual users and their carers should be involved throughout the assessment and care management process"</p></blockquote>
and that:
<br><blockquote><p>"they should feel that the process is aimed at meeting their wishes."</p></blockquote>
That shows the importance that the Government attach to ensuring that users and their carers have an opportunity for their views to be taken into account. Our guidance, "Care Management and Assessment", states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new arrangements for care management and assessment are designed to create a more equal relationship between practitioners and users/carers, with maximum participation by the latter. Procedure and practice will have to be amended to ensure that the needs, views and preferences of users are placed first and that the role of and contribution of carers receive greater attention."</p></blockquote>
The debate has provided an opportunity for me to emphasise the Government's commitment not only to ensuring that choice exists, but that that choice can be taken on a well-informed basis. Indeed, those principles are entirely consistent with the citizens charter, although the charter does not extend to community care services. The hon. Member for Perry Barr recognised that I would not accept the amendment because I believe that, in the legislation that I have referred to and the guidance I have quoted, we have taken those concerns into account.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Tessa Jowell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(IZD) Arrangements shall only be made by virtue of this section where the relevant authority and the voluntary organisation or other person providing accommodation agree to a trial period of residence in respect of each person to be placed in the accommodation."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would ensure that the decision of elderly people to leave their own home and move into residential care was properly considered and based on their choice or,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
if they could not directly make that choice themselves, that such a move was deemed as being in their best interests by their carer or their close relatives.<br><br>
It is important to remember that, in some previous debates, we sought to enshrine in the legislation what we broadly recognise as good practice. I am sure that there would be no dispute—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying hard to listen to what the hon. Lady is saying, but a number of conversations are taking place in the Committee Room. The hon. Lady is as entitled to be heard as any other member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would not be necessary if the Minister had accepted some of the previous Opposition amendments, particularly the one which dealt with advocacy and the appointment of an authorised representative. This amendment would be a further safeguard which we consider to be necessary to protect the best interests of elderly people at a stage in their lives when they are most vulnerable and have no direct control over many important decisions which are made for them.<br><br>
We need to consider the amendment in the context of understanding why elderly people enter residential care. There is considerable community of view about this, which has been reinforced by studies carried out by the National Institute for Social Work. It identified the major cause of admission to residential care as being a deterioration in the carer's capacity to cope, rather than a deterioration in the elderly person's circumstances.<br><br>
If respite care is offered as a result of a timely intervention, it may be possible for the elderly person to go back home and for the caring arrangements that applied before his or her period of respite to be resumed. I do not think that there is any argument that, wherever possible, elderly people prefer to be cared for in their own homes. Indeed, care at home is at the centre of the Government's approach.<br><br>
We must recognise the scale of the personal consequences of admission to residential care. I am often struck by how very easily decisions can be made which ignore the elderly person's loss of choice. Elderly people have much more control over their lives if they live at home and do as they choose than if they are in a residential home. In a home, mealtimes are set and the individual providing personal care has been appointed to do that job rather than being chosen by the elderly person.<br><br>
In a home, elderly people do not have the freedom to get up in the middle of the night and watch television if they have difficulty in sleeping or to make a cup of tea, because very few homes allow elderly people free access to the kitchen on health and safety grounds. There is a direct collision between the perceived needs of a home's managers to run the home safely and, increasingly, economically, and the best interests of the elderly residents in determining the pattern of their daily lives.<br><br>
The amendment is important; it would provide a cooling-off period after what may have been a crisis which precipitated the elderly person's admission to residential care. It would also provide a clear statutory framework for a period of reconsideration. I would not want us to prescribe how long the trial period should be. I suggest that it should be somewhere between one and three months<br><br>
However, we should take account of research studies showing that at any time, about 10 per cent. of elderly people in residential care could have coped at home had an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
alternative been available. At the time of admission for residential care, that figure is higher—studies quote figures of about 17 per cent. That is a pretty high rate. It is because so many people would have preferred an alternative at the time of admission that it is so important to build in to the measure the opportunity for a statutory review.<br><br>
The proposal would also, I hope, lead to a continuation of benefit for elderly people who were maintaining their home during the trial period, while being in residential care. Some of the discontinuities between living at home and being admitted to residential care militate directly against the flexibility that we all agree is necessary. It is ridiculous for elderly people to be forced to give up their home simply because the benefits that might otherwise have enabled them to keep them going throughout the trial period were to cease. A number of consequential decisions would have to be made on the basis of the amendment's incorporation in the Bill.<br><br>
I should like to refer briefly to the Birmingham information file, which I was responsible for initiating when I was director of the community care special action project. The information file came about as a direct consequence of an attempt to develop community care in ways that were more directly responsive to the needs and wishes of users and carers. To have information about admission to residential care, what the regime would involve and what services were on offer were requirements that carers constantly reiterated in our consultations with them. I stress the anxiety that many of them felt about the irreversibility of the decision to admit a relative to residential care. So, in tabling the amendment, we are speaking on behalf of carers and their anxieties as well as arguing for enhancing the rights of elderly residents.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
A statutory trial period would also increase the permeability of the boundary between residential and other forms of care. That is highly desirable. At times, we fail to recognise—because we fail to be aware of the carer's needs—the vast range of informal tasks that many residential care homes undertake on behalf of the people living in those communities. If we could build in and reinforce within the regimes of residential care homes an expectation that some people will be there for a short time and some people will be there for the rest of their lives and that the regime has to incorporate both types, there would be more scope for incorporating a third group.<br><br>
I once stayed in a residential care home in Birmingham. The head of the home watched a woman in the street outside pushing an elderly relative to the shops. The head said, "I could look after her relative for a couple of hours and then she would not need to take her with her." Homes could do that much more. That capacity of community care is waiting to be developed. It would have a better chance to develop if there were a more systematic statutory framework that recognised the progressive steps by which people become permanent residents of residential care homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pick up the Lady's last point about the substantial potential that exists for providers of residential care to offer wider services, perhaps on an informal basis. I have visited establishments which have an impressively positive and lively atmosphere and a mixture of long-term residents, short-term residents and day visitors, who may visit regularly once or twice a week or just
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
on a one-off basis for a couple of hours, as a form of short-term respite care. That sort of flexibility is desirable and leads to gains on all sides. For example, the arrival of daily visitors can enliven the social lives of longer-term residents.<br><br>
It is partly because of the advantages of flexibility that I am cautious about the amendment. Of course, it is desirable in the majority of cases that prospective residents should have the opportunity of trial periods in the homes to which it is proposed that they should move. However, for many of the same reasons that I resisted earlier amendments, I believe that the Bill is not the right vehicle for what is essentially a matter of good practice. To build into statute through primary legislation an obligation for a trial period of between one and three months, as the hon. Member for Dulwich suggested, is not helpful. It would remove some flexibility. It is not always possible to arrange a trial period in cases of an emergency admission—perhaps after a bereavement, or when someone is deliberately admitted for a short period in their own interests.<br><br>
The guidance in "Home Life" emphasises the importance of trial periods in paragraph 2.1.4, which suggests that the first two months or longer after a resident enters a home on a long-term basis should be mutually recognised as a trial period. One way to avoid the disruption and upheaval that would be caused by the failure of a trial period and a resident wishing to move out afterwards is to ensure that good information is available about the kind of life that is offered by particular establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I have misunderstood, but he suggested that the trial period might be mutually agreed. That does not quite meet the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich. If the trial period is mutually agreed between the person entering care and the owner of the establishment, that is all very well, but what happens over the financial arrangements for the rent and the standing charges that may be necessary to maintain the property? That is not mutual between the resident and the home owner because it involves the Department of Social Security and the local authority. The Minister's response does not meet those consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The phrase in the guidance is "mutually recognised" rather than "mutually agreed". Any kind of trial period raises wider issues that the amendment does not address. If we were to accept an amendment that required, by law, a trial period of residence for anyone entering residential care, there would be a whole range of consequences, including the point that was made about benefit entitlements and other charges. It is not helpful to make a trial period a statutory obligation. It would be better to minimise the risk of an unsatisfactory placement by providing good information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems is the task of creating certainty for elderly people and their carers. If the Minister would agree to a community care charter, this is precisely the type of guarantee of standard service that should be included. Does the Minister feel that, given the general agreement that exists about the importance of certainty and clarity over what the users and the carers can expect, a charter would be an acceptable way of achieving it?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In practice, there will be nothing to prevent the local authority social services department from setting out and publishing the standards and practices that it expects to be followed. At local level, such guarantees would then be available. We are revising the guidance in "Home Life". The question of a charter for community care will increasingly be raised, because of the high profile of the subject. As we approach the final phase of implementation, we shall wish to consider ways in which satisfactorily high standards of service can be guaranteed to users and their carers.<br><br>
Such issues are better addressed outside the framework of primary legislation. There is no doubt that it is possible to build a variety of standards into legislation. The danger is that anything that is not included may be seen as less important. Even with the assistance of well-informed members of the Committee, it would be impossible to include a comprehensive selection of items. Standards also improve over time; it is an evelutionary process. A Bill passed this year might, in five or 10 years, seem out of date compared with the standards that we would by then expect to provide for elderly or other people in residential accommodation. We would be left with the task of revising legislation each time that we wanted to apply a new standard.<br><br>
By dealing with such issues through guidance—the hon. Lady suggested a charter—we preserve flexibility. Local authorities will want to consider how to provide a strong safeguard for standards. That is a better way of doing it. The trial period might be difficult to achieve in some circumstances, such as an emergency omission. I hope that the hon. Lady, having promoted a useful debate, will withdraw her amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Government will produce, with a great fanfare, a charter for users of residential care. I hope that they take on board the points made in the charter published by the Labour party in August last year. We are not opposed to charters—we began the practice. We set down basic, simple points. We were asked why, as it was so simple, no one had done it before. We will not be churlish; we will encourage the Minister to produce a charter.<br><br>
For emergencies there would clearly have to be a set of ground rules for a trial period, depending on whether the person had been in his own accommodation, in private rented or public sector rented accommodation, or with a housing association. If people were admitted in an emergency there would be a different set of rules. But that is not how we would construct the policy; it must cover the generality of people. They could benefit from knowing that it was a trial period to see whether they would settle in. They would feel less cut off when they left their homes and went into a care-away-from-home establishment. When they spent their first night in a new establishment they would not have to wake up the next morning knowing that, for the rest of their lives, whatever happened and whether they liked it or not, that would be where they would live, with no possibility of going back home if they were able to retain some independence.<br><br>
There is good reason to believe that there should be ground rules for a trial period beyond that which would be considered reasonable in a deal between a social service department and a home owner for a trial period of a week or two. That would be unacceptable because it would not constitute a proper trial period. People who move into a form of sheltered housing are in a different position because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
they have a tenancy agreement. People who go into care do not get tenancy agreements. They do not get a contract as such. They are not on all fours even with someone in intensive sheltered housing.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich may return to that point in the open-ended debate on Report. I am pleased about that. An open-ended debate could last more than one day, which was what I thought the Government had offered. We could benefit from a good, lengthy debate on the issue of a trial period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This legislation has attracted broad cross-party support because we believe that it is the Government's genuine wish to strengthen and reinforce the position of users and carers in their negotiations with those who provide the services. Increasing entitlement creates the desire for choice about which we have had much discussion. Those elements of the legislation are extremely popular with users and carers and form part of the basis of our support for the measure.<br><br>
The Government cannot simply talk about redressing the balance; they must provide users and carers with the leverage to do so. The Government must provide a framework to redress the imbalance, and not simply exhort local authorities and voluntary organisations to behave differently. History will prove that that approach is a failure. We shall return to those arguments on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(IZF) Arrangements shall only be made by virtue of this section where the voluntary organisation or other person providing the accommodation provides a statement to the authority giving details of their basic charges, any supplementary charges and the criteria they will employ for raising their charges in future years.'.</p></blockquote>
I have learnt my lesson of the day, unless you care to give me a second lesson, Mr. McWilliam. The amendment would require establishments to do three things: to spell out their basic charges, to inform clients or residents about items for which supplementary charges may be made, and to tell clients about the criteria that will be used in future to govern increases in charges.<br><br>
The need to establish basic charges was brought home to me before the election, when I travelled around York in my campaign bus. It was not a battle bus—it would have fallen apart at the first sound of gunfire. A man climbed on board to complain that he had received a bill for almost £2,500 in charges for his brother-in-law, who had entered a nursing home three weeks previously. The bill covered accomadation for three weeks and a month in advance. He was a council tenant and had no means of paying it. If he had paid the bill, his and his wife's entire life savings would have been spent. They had received no warning of the bill.<br><br>
I contacted the home and health authority that had discharged the patient to the home. I explained to the home that the family had no legal obligation to pay the bill. I asked the health authority to contact the home to work out an arrangement with social security. It is worrying that such matters were not tackled when the patient was discharged from the hospital and that his relatives were not informed of the terms on which the person, who had lived with them for many years before going to hospital, would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
live in future. If that can happen in a nursing home when there is no obligation to make a clear statement of fees and who will pay at the time of referral, it can happen elsewhere. In some homes, supplementary charges are minor matters that can be paid from pocket money, if such money is retained by the resident. However, in other cases, such charges amount to substantial expenditure. In the survey to which I referred earlier, we found that 25 per cent. of private nursing homes, 10 per cent. of private residential homes and 5 per cent. of part III homes charged for physiotherapy. Some private homes charged for occupational therapy. In four out of five nursing homes, and even in half of the part III homes in our sample, additional charges were made for chiropody. Some private homes even charged for personal laundry, though that was not the case in the public sector homes that we examined. A few homes charged for medicines and almost all charged for hairdressing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr said earlier, a considerable number of homes charged for incontinence pads. Charges were made for newspapers in almost every home. It seems absurd that in this place we can get as many free newspapers as we want, yet elderly people on much lower incomes have to pay for their own. It is particularly absurd, considering that we say how important it is for people to remain in touch with the outside world when they enter an institution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is an offence under the rules of the House to remove newspapers from the Rooms in which they are deposited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you misunderstood me, Mr. McWilliam. I do not suggest that newspapers should be removed from the Rooms in which they are deposited any more than I expect residents in institutions to remove them from their sitting rooms or common areas. The fact is that we do not have to pay for papers in this place, whereas in most residential establishments older people have to pay for them, to remain in touch with the outside world.<br><br>
Charges were made also for entertainment in some cases. The list continued and included many other smaller items. An establishment that charges for a wide range of those services will add substantially to a resident's weekly or monthly bill. When considering a move to some form of accommodation other than their own homes, people need to know clearly what charges they will incur so that they can guarantee that they can meet those charges and maintain a decent quality of life, buying the few luxuries that they were used to buying in the past.<br><br>
Finally, I want to discuss the question of setting criteria for raising charges. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms. Coffey) mentioned a case in her constituency in which some elderly residents were discharged because they could no longer afford to pay. I have encountered the same problem in my constituency of York. Not long ago, two elderly people were discharged—I suppose "evicted" is the proper word—from a nursing home which had raised its fees substantially beyond the supplementary benefit or social security support level because they were unable to pay. Ultimately, the health authority had to take them in as its responsibility, at considerable expense to the public sector, while another home was sought. It was an exceptionally unnerving, destabilising and unpleasant experience for the elderly people involved. It is unpleasant for anyone to lose their home, but it is a disgrace for elderly, highly dependent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
people to lose their homes, to be shunted into long-stay beds by the health authority and then to be shunted, without being given any choice, into other homes. There must be a guarantee that people will not find themselves in such circumstances. That is what the amendment would achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be many problems over the next few years with the funding of community care. I shall briefly outline those problems. The Bill is about introducing marketplace operations. When the Minister is asked about standards and charges, he replies that the market will take care of them: homes will have to adjust their charges according to demand. If charges rise too high, demand will lessen. That is the market mechanism that will ensure that the cost of care will not be too high. I am not sure how that will operate in practice. Each local authority will receive a sum of money—it is not yet clear how much or how it will be paid—to buy the whole range of community care and support services to prevent people from going into residential care. That money, of necessity, will be limited for several reasons. Many local authorities have had their spending capped. The price that homes charge will be pertinent to local authorities' ability to supply a range of provison for elderly people.<br><br>
The amendment would enable local authorities to plan the cost of residential care not only for this year but also for next year. Marketplace determination of prices can work only at the point of admission. At the point of admitting an elderly person, it can be determined whether the price can be afforded. If, next year, the price rises, and, at the point of admission, next year's price is unknown, the authority will be left to pick up the bill.<br><br>
What happens if the price unexpectedly rises? It is not an option to move elderly people from one home to another simply because the cost is too high. There is a commitment to keep elderly people in their homes for as long as they need care and for as long as the home provides that care. The local authority's problem is to determine the continuing cost of that commitment, which is difficult unless this year's price and the likely price for next year are known. A home could say that it would raise prices in line with inflation or by 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. each year. The local authority would know what the cost of care would be for next year and could plan accordingly.<br><br>
I am worried about the second, not the first, year of operation. Residential care costs will inevitably rise because costs generally will increase. If local authorities cannot determine the cost of care in the second year, they may not be able to afford to pay that cost. Local authorities cannot regulate the price of private care except through the market mechanism. The only regulatory power that authorities have is the power to transfer people or not to enter them in the first place. To ensure that local authorities can plan, it is critical that there should be a price list for care. Part of the Government's problem with the escalating price of residential care is their inability to regulate the cost of private care. Had they known last year, when they introduced the DSS grant, that they would be faced with private care bills, they would have wanted a regulatory body. The price of private care has risen because it has not been curbed. The Government are not aware from one year to the next what the price of private care will be, so there is an inevitable gap between the cost of the care and the DSS grant.<br><br>

12 noon<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will have a great deal of sympathy with the argument, because local authorities will be faced with exactly the same problem that has defeated the Government over the cost of private care in the past few years. We want local authorities to be able to plan for the price of care by asking that homes provide a price list when residents are admitted and give an indication of how that cost may rise. The amendment does not state that costs should rise only by a certain amount, or that any other stipulations should be made. It merely states that that information should be provided so that when an elderly person is admitted to residential care the local authority will be aware of the possible cost of the care that year and the following year.<br><br>
I am not confident that the Government intend to put a great deal of money into the public sector—in fact, I fear the reverse—and I am worried that local authorities may have to make unacceptable choices between the money put into the infrastructure for community care, which prevents admission to residential homes, and the money that they have to provide for those in residential homes. In future they might have to make savings in community care to pay for escalating residential care bills.<br><br>
Once a person is admitted to residential care, that person is likely to stay there and the bill will have to be picked up year after year. If that cost increases and the money put into community care services decreases, in a few years' time the whole of the community care budget will be swallowed up by the cost of residential care. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to that problem, because it concerns the Government as well as local authorities. Unless attention is paid to it, the Government's plans for community care, commendable though they are, will not be implemented, and that will be embarrassing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few practical points, using the same perspective.<br><br>
The most difficult aspect of the transition to community care is paying for it. When the Government postponed that transition two years ago they did so not because it was undesirable but because the money was not there. If we are to believe certain newspapers, that is still an issue. The Secretary of State may want to ring-fence that money to ensure that local authorities spend it on community care. That is important because the money will be needed for community care. The issue has featured again in the press this week because of the large sums are involved.<br><br>
The algebra group is finding it difficult to work out a formula that can be presented as equitable for local authorities. It is difficult to estimate the length of time that elderly residents will live after they have been moved into community care, but it is an essential part of the costs. I am well aware of the argument about whether the money should be tailored to last three years, as the average life expectancy of elderly people who make the transition, or whether it should last five years. We must also remember that the Bill deals with people in residential care with learning difficulties who have a long life expectancy. It is very difficult to determine what is an equitable amount of funding to be transferred. Therefore, we need the safeguards of which my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport spoke. I say that as one who, for two years, had responsibility for a major city's social services budget.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
It has been suggested that local authorities are reluctant to put money for residential care into the voluntary and private sector. I can only say that I controlled a budget of between £2 million and £3 million which was spent on residential care not provided directly by the authority. At the end of last year, when we were determining the budget for the current year, I was in some trouble because there was an overspend of £304,000 on that item in my budget. That excess was easily accounted for by the rises in the costs of residential care in certain establishments. In some cases, the costs were extraordinary—as high as £118,000 a year for some placements, although I admit that they did not involve elderly people. Court orders directing even one client to particular residential care with that sort of costing can throw a budget completely askew.<br><br>
As a result of that overspending, we initiated a review of the people on whom that sum of more than £2 million was being spent. It was very hard to find more than a handful of people who could reasonably, and in accordance with their wishes, be transferred to other institutions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport said, a placement that works in a residential setting is going to continue. There was severe pressure in this financial year to remove money from that budget head because it was desparately needed elsewhere. We had to insist that that £304,000 overspend could not be eradicated. In fact, it will almost certainly be larger this year, because new placements have to be made. It is very difficult when homes make additional charges and expect the local authority to pick up the bill.<br><br>
One perfectly acceptable home in my constituency caters for people who have learning difficulties. It is used and respected by the local authority, but it increased its charges in the anticipation that the authority would be able to top-up the payments as soon as they were required. That was impossible, given the budget circumstances and the number of people in that establishment. We received correspondence from the parents of that establishment's residents, and from the people who cared for them when they were not in the residential setting, pressing us to make those top-up payments. That has proved impossible. As it is a responsible institution, it said that it would keep those residents for a limited time so that we could make up the payments in the following year's budget. There has been a lot of correspondence about almost every client.<br><br>
It is essential that we have the financial information and that we know the criteria that an institution will use to increase its charges. We do not know what will happen to inflation, but some criteria must be set. Local authorities must have some measure, for planning purposes. I cannot understand why the Government are not anxious that financial information should be made available to local authorities and central Government about the way in which the residential care system will work in future.<br><br>
Such a safeguard is necessary when a change is taking place that involves high costs and when there is grave uncertainty about how those costs will be met. Furthermore, we do not know how council tax payers will be affected. The amendment is an essential safeguard. I shall be surprised if the Minister can convince me that it is unnecessary and that local authorities would not find it important in controlling their future expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Liz Lynne <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One question has been worrying me about the pocket-money element that elderly people receive. Once the money is transferred to local authorities, how does the Minister envisage that the money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
will be paid? Will it still be paid to the elderly person through the DSS? Will it be paid to the local authority, who will pay it to the elderly person? Or will it be covered by the basic charge in the elderly person's home, and will the person who runs the home pay the pocket-money element to the elderly person? I am worried that if the personal allowance is not safeguarded, it might disappear, which would mean that many elderly people would not be able to afford hairdressing, to buy biscuits or purchase other things that enhance their quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my concern is that the effect of the amendment would lead to statutory intervention in negotiations between local authorities and private or voluntary sector providers. Such intervention would not help local authorities to make satisfactory contracts in the interests of securing the best service for their client, nor would it ensure that their resources were used to the greatest effect by obtaining the best value for money. The imposition of a statutory requirement in the negotiating process is unlikely to be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Ann Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the Government are not averse to imposing statutory interventions in local government financial planning. Poll tax capping is the most savage intervention in terms of public expenditure, so I do not follow the consistency of the Minister's argument. Is the Minister willing to finance the rising cost of residential care for local authorities? Are the Government willing to pick up residents' bills year by year? If they are not, do they expect local authorities to do so? Does it mean that intervention would come not where we suggest, which would enable local authorities to plan properly, but that it would take the form of poll tax capping?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be much less inclined to give way to the hon. Lady if her interventions are always of such length and introduce wholly irrelevant issues such as charge capping. However, I am glad to have the opportunity of stating that the Government will continue to apply charge caps in the interest of charge payers to defend them against the absurd extravagance of all too many Labour-controlled authorities.<br><br>
I shall return to the subject under discussion. The purpose of leaving authorities free to negotiate with independent providers, without imposing statutory requirements, is to allow authorities to get the best deal for their clients and the best value for money for public sector tax and charge payers.<br><br>
From April 1993, each residential accommodation provider will agree with local authorities charges for caring for people that authorities place with them. The agreed charge, and what it covers, will be dealt with in the contract between the local authority and the provider. There is no need, therefore, for a separate provision specifying that the charge in each case should be set out by the provider for the local authority to consider. The imposition of such a requirement could make it harder for the local authority to negotiate. If a scale of charges had to be issued, local authorities might find it difficult or impossible to negotiate more favourable terms.<br><br>
I cannot imagine a situation after April 1993 in which a local authority, as a matter of good practice, would make an arrangement in which charges, including supplementary charges, were not specified in the contract that resulted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
from the negotiations. The Government, because of our interest in eatablishing good practice in the contracting process, have commissioned KPMG Peat Marwick to undertake a study to identify good practice in local authorities that involves the independent sector in community care planning, with particular reference to residential provision. In the light of that study, we shall consider whether it is necessary to publish further guidance later this year—before April next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister state whether the KPMG Peat Marwick report will be published and, if so, when?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the report so I cannot say whether we shall publish it or, if we do, when. If the report will help local authorities to discharge their duties, we should be ready to publish it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockport mentioned resources. In this matter more than any other, considering that social security expenditure has risen by 150 times since the Government came into office and provides for more than 20 times the number of people that it used to, I find it surprising that it should be suggested that we are not willing to make resources available to meet the needs of that group of people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is clear that we are asking about the future? The Government allowed those increases in response to need. Does the Minister accept that if need increases, resources should be provided in the different forms that become necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made it clear that our policy will be fairly resourced. I cite what has happened previously as an earnest of our intent for the future. Even the standing spending assessment for local authority expenditure in personal social services has increased by 15 per cent. in real terms over the past two years. That is a substantial real increase. Doubts about our willingness to provide the resources to meet the needs of people who may wish to enter residential care are not borne out by our record over the past 13 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An increase of 19 per cent. in the SSA for social services is correct, but we must consider what happens in practice. In my case, my budget for social services was already much more than 19 per cent. above the SSA when that year started. Therefore, I was unable to have another 19 per cent. on my budget; I was told that I was already well over the SSA because the authority had put great emphasis on social services in the past. An increase was needed immediately and I got a small one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be responsible for the inability of the social services committee in Leeds to negotiate a decent share of the available resources. If the hon. Gentleman could not persuade his colleagues to allow him to spend up to the SSA—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a long way above my SSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on negotiating so effectively and denying his colleagues resources that they were doubtless trying to obtain for themselves. If authorities were spending well over their SSAs on social services in the past, I hope that, unless they were grossly incompetent, the standard of service available was very satisfactory in those areas.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
In response to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), I confirm what I said on Tuesday, what was said in the House during questions last week and what was said on Second Reading—that the policy will be introduced on time in April next year.<br><br>
In reply to the point raised by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms. Lynne), we shall ensure that a specified sum remains available for personal expenses, in the form of pocket money, for everyone placed by the local authority. That minimum sum will be specified and published. I cannot yet say in which form it will be provided, but I shall let the hon. Lady know in due course.<br><br>
I think that I have explained why it is undesirable to impose a statutory obstacle that would curtail the freedom of local authorities to negotiate the best possible deal with independent sector providers. For that reason, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 2, line 34, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(IZK) The making of an arrangement by virtue of this section shall not preclude the making of any other arrangement or payment under any other enactment in respect of any other occupant whereby the same accommodation is treated as sheltered accommodation.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with flexibility and ensuring that opportunities can be taken in an appropriate way. It involves defining the fine line between sheltered accommodation and residential accommodation. The Government recognise the need to ensure that arbitrary definitions do not limit the capacity to provide appropriate care. That is why the Government have introduced the Bill and why we are discussing it in Committee. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that an inappropriate definition does not prevent an appropriate placement. It bends the law sensibly to bring Abbeyfield and similar unregistered or small homes within the range of premises with which residential care arrangements can be made.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to ensure that the consequence is not to bend another line so that such accommodation is excluded from the category of sheltered accommodation. It seems sensible to have an overlap rather than a gap between the two types of accommodation. The definition should describe how the accommodation is used and what leads to a client going into a particular place.<br><br>
How would it work in practice? If the unit is defined as sheltered accommodation, a resident would still be able to receive care. The care element would be funded as part of a package of community care, if that was a direct alternative to residential or nursing home care. The same applies to various adult family placement schemes and other forms of minimal care in provided accommodation.<br><br>
We welcome any measure that gives greater flexibilty—which is the the purpose of Bill—but we want to be careful not to increase financial responsibility and expectation out of the same pot of money. That would undoubtedly be the case, if there were an expectation that social services departments would meet the costs of the Abbeyfield society and other organisations in providing homes for people who would not otherwise be likely to go into residential or nursing home care. All that social services departments will receive from the Benefits Agency is an estimate of what would have been spent on supporting people in private and voluntary residential or nursing homes. It needs to be used
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
for that purpose, or for a package of community care as a direct alternative. If the net were to be widened, and if the type of premises that could be used were defined as those premises capable of being treated only as residential accommodation and not as sheltered accommodation without additional resources being provided, that could lead to increased expectations which social services departments would be unable to meet.<br><br>
The amendment would allow flexibility for the accommodation for which arrangements could be made under the Bill. It could be defined as sheltered accommodation or as residential accommodation, depending on the circumstances. It would be a sensible and British compromise which would avoid the anomaly that could arise if an inappropriate dividing line were enforced on the basis of unfeeling logic rather than on the basis allowing the public bodies involved to exercise humanity and flexibility in the way in which they provide care. I urge the Minister to provide clarification sought in the amendment to ensure that we do not create a dividing line or a chasm for people seeking sheltered accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly share the hon. Gentleman's desire that the arrangements should be as flexible as possible. We would not wish to have any unnecessary restrictions. The amendment is necessary because it would not have any effect. Arrangements for residential accommodation, wherever it may be, will be for individuals and they will not preclude or affect any other arrangements or payments for other arrangements made on behalf of other residents, even in the same accommodation. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 arrangements for residential accommodation will be designed to meet the individual needs of elderly people. They will undergo assessments to establish how their care needs can best be met: in a residential care home, a nursing home, a hostel, a group home, or in sheltered or other types of accommodation. The Bill will allow local authorities to make any of those arrangements for a prospective resident.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The arrangements will be personal. They will not include other arrangements, or payments made for other people in the same accommodation. I assure the hon. Gentleman that by rejecting the amendment we are not precluding making changes on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has responded in the same spirit in which I tabled the amendment. I am grateful for his assurance about checking and confirming. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, though we may return to it on Report, should that prove necessary in order to retain the clarity that the Minister wants as much as we do.</span></p>

protracted than the Government had originally hoped. I shall not raise any quibbles at this stage. I am grateful to my hon. Friends, who have served diligently. They have all earned considerable credit with my hon. Friend the Member for Berkshire, East by their attitude and demeanour. I am grateful to the Opposition for their constructive approach. The Bill's principles were agreed between us and we tried to make it as effective as possible. I also wish to say thank you through you, Mr. McWilliam, to the staff of the House and to my officials.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I also thank you. I hope that you will convey our thanks to Dame Janet, who kicked off our proceedings firmly. I also wish to thank the <i>Hansard</i> staff.<br><br>
Conservative Members may have been told that they could see how a Committee works because the Bill would last only one sitting. I hope that they have enjoyed it and have learnt that the Opposition works much harder than the Government. The work rate of Opposition Back Benchers is substantially greater than that of Government Back Benchers. I know what it is like to be a Government Back Bencher and to be told to sit down and keep quiet, although I have recovered.<br><br>
I wish also to thank my hon. Friends, five of whom were elected on 9 April. All of them have much greater expertise on the subject than members of the Front Bench and they have put it to great effect. I hope that they have used the Committee as a learning process.<br><br>
We have grabbed the welcome opportunity to discuss community care. The Bill intended to pass on the nod at 4 o'clock on a Friday in February. It was halfway through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
that process before an objection was made. We have had a golden opportunity. I hope that we can have a constructive debate next Wednesday that will benefit our constituents. I look forward to seeing you another day, Mr. McWilliam, because I know that you will have next Wednesday off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) and for Perry Barr for their kind remarks. I will certainly pass them on to the First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, I also thank all members of the Committee for their co-operation. There have been 11 new Members of Parliament on this Committee—a record number. Even when I was new, it was nothing like that. Their ability to take my strictures with good humour has been much appreciated. I have been tryng to teach them, as far as I can.<br><br>
I should like to notify the hon. Members for Doncaster, North and for York that I shall be visiting their constituencies briefly this afternoon, but I will not get off the train. I am not going anywhere near Erewash, but that is not my choice.<br><br>
I must now close the Committee in an orderly fashion by putting the question.</span></p>
