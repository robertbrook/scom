	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>"GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [10 December]:</i> No. 262, in page 8, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) in pursuance of proposals for the purpose published under section 	<i>(Proposals by governing bodies)</i> of this Act for two or more existing grant-maintained schools to be conducted by a single governing body.'.—[	<i>Mr. Don Foster.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking new clause 13—	<i>Proposals by governing bodies</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Regulations may make provision for two or more grant-maintained primary schools to be conducted as a group by a single governing body where the governing bodies of those schools have made joint proposals in a prescribed manner to the Secretary of State in accordance with this section.
	<ol>
	<li>Any provision of this Part of this Act may apply, with or without modification, to—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>procedures prior to the making of such proposals, or</li>
	<li>such proposals, or</li>
	<li>the conduct of such schools in such manner as the Secretary of State may determine.'.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) for tabling this amendment. I remind the Committee that clause 114 allows grant-maintained schools to propose to join an existing group of schools and for two groups to propose to merge to form a single group. Those provisions will cover unusual circumstances and will help grant-maintained schools. The amendment and the new clause set out a similar process to allow existing grant-maintained schools to propose to form a group, which is a variation on the theme. I accept that there is no reason in principle why they should not be permitted to do so. We did not allow for that because we thought it unlikely that two or more existing small grant-maintained primary schools would want to form a group or would be conveniently located to do so. We thought that it was more likely that an existing grant-maintained school might be close to an established group formed as a result of the Bill. Clause 114, will enable it to join such a group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if two or more existing grant-maintained primary schools see the benefit of forming close ties in a formal group under the Bill, that is a matter for them. I am content in principle to accept the intent and the thrust of the amendment and the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Bath. However, I should like to study the wording which probably needs to be refined. For example, it may be important to make it clear that only existing grant-maintained primary schools could form a group, just as only LEA primary schools can. I want to examine that aspect. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
am content with the principle of the amendment and the new clause. I ask him to withdraw the amendment and I will undertake to introduce a new provision—I hope during the Committee stage and perhaps under a subsequent clause—to give effect to the intention of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Minister's acceptance of the underlying principle of the amendment and the new clause and his agreement to introduce new wording later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 235, in page 8, line 42, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and in determining the amounts of such grants it shall be the duty of the funding authority to exercise its powers with a view to ensuring minimum standards of provision for sufficient books and equipment, the maintenance of school buildings and sufficient resources to limit class sizes to a level prescribed by orders from time to time made by the Secretary of State.'.</p></blockquote>
Instead of introducing this worthless Bill, the Government should have ensured first and foremost that the statute laid down a minimum standard for resourcing education. Instead of a Bill which will cause—I keep saying this, and I shall say it again—chaos and confusion—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am delighted that Conservative Members now agree with us that the Bill will cause chaos and confusion in the education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the sounds of agreement on the Conservative Benches are related to the fact that the distinguished Chairman of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts made exactly the same points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. I have a press report of what the Select Committee Chairman said. I shall not read it out because the Opposition have read it. I am sure that most Conservative Members read it with dismay. I respect the hon. Member for Crosby (Sir M. Thornton), who is an excellent Chairman. If it had not been for Labour Members, he would not have chaired the Select Committee. Conservative Members did not want him to be Chairman. He does not want to cause trouble. He claims that many reforms are taking place at present; that LEAs are being dismantled by backdoor methods; that it would be preferable if the Government admitted that they want to get rid of LEAs, and did it with a clean cut. Many Conservatives, not only Conservative Members of Parliament, are worried about the Bill. They can see that it will cause the chaos and confusion that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should have taken account of staffing levels and class sizes; the resources that are necessary to buy books and equipment and in-service training for teachers. But it tackles none of those issues. It is a vindictive Bill, designed to get rid of LEAs by the back door and to centralise our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979, the share of the gross national product going to education has declined from 5·5 to 4·6 per cent. Central Government spending is 30 per cent. lower in real terms than in 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that he is being economical with the truth? The numbers of children who are being educated has declined. If that it taken into account, spending per pupil has increased by more than 40 per cent. in real terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not right. I am being accused of being economical with the truth, but it is the hon. Gentleman who is economical with the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all bandy statistics. One can make statistics prove anything. Statistics from Walworth road might be biased towards the Labour party; statistics from Tory central office might be biased towards the Government. However, the statistics to which I refer are from the Library. I assume that all hon. Members believe the Library to be impartial. I am sure that the staff are not politically biased when they provide information. Those statistics show that education has lost the equivalent of £1·5 billion this year. In 1980–81, Government spending on education was 14·9 per cent. of total spending on services. In 1990–92, it had decreased to 14·2 per cent. The Library concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over this period real spending on education and science increased by an annual average of 1·5 per cent. compared with 1·6 per cent. for general government spending as a whole. If spending had still represented the 14·9 per cent. of total government on services it did in 1980–81, it would have been over £1½ billion more last year at about £32½ billion."</p></blockquote>
Whether we like it or not—whether the numbers of children have declined, or the Smith square figures are accurate—£1·5 billion less in real terms is being spent on education than in 1980–81. Hon. Members may disagree with the figures, but they are impartial statistics from the research section of the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, the hon. Gentleman has not answered the point that I raised. Spending has altered in the way that he described, but the number of pupils in our schools has declined substantially because the number of children in that age range has declined. Hence, spending per pupil has increased significantly. The figure that I quoted was correct. The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with that point but is being deliberately selective with the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not being selective with the facts. I am quoting the impartial statistics given to me by the Library, which show that £1·5 billion has been taken from the education budget over the past 10 years. Regardless of whether the number of pupils has declined, the amount that is spent on education has fallen considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the prospects for education depend largely on the criteria for local government capping. As a result, schools increasingly rely on fund-raising activities to pay for books, computers, practical equipment and raw materials. Some schools even raise money to contribute to their teachers' salaries. That is deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents and teachers are forced to spend inordinate amounts of time raising funds to pay for essential school items. Teachers are often required to neglect teaching—the job for which they were hired—to work on fund raising. Recently, I was told about a school that employs a fund raiser. That is appalling. That is not what I was led to believe state education is all about. I understood state education to be a well-resourced service that was free at the point of delivery. That did not include paying a person to raise funds to ensure that there are enough books and materials to teach the children in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that, when I was a head teacher, my staff raised funds. However, it was done light-heartedly at social events when staff, parents and friends of the school had a pleasant time. The money that was raised before 1979 was used on luxuries. We did not pay for books, teachers or for essential teaching equipment. We raised
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
money for luxury items, such as a video recorder, that we did not expect the county authority to purchase. I remember buying a video camera through fund raising in 1979, when most people had not heard of such things. In those days, we were not under pressure to raise funds for essential items. However, when I left the school in 1987, books and other essential equipment were becoming hard to get out of capital allocation. We were thinking of using school funds to purchase essential equipment. That happened over about five or six years, when Thatcherite policies came into our lives. If the shortfall is not met, children will suffer. Parents are having to dig deeper and deeper into their own pockets to pay for essential items. Some parents are even covenanting money to schools to pay for essential items, which is appalling in the state sector: the state sector is becoming privatised through the back door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategic role of the LEAs' planning and their service to schools have been undermined. The demands of the national curriculum require the necessary resources to be made available. The amendment would ensure that such resources were available to the grant-maintained schools from the funding authorities. All children, no matter how rich or poor their parents may be, must have books and equipment for their education. If the teachers do not have the tools, they cannot do the job for which they are paid. In 1991, four out of five schools had fewer than 10 books per student, which is well below the recommended minimum. Last year, additional spending in schools ranged from about £1·20 to £41·20 per pupil on books and materials. How can our children have a fair chance and an equal opportunity when such wide variations exist in our different LEAs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I forgot to mention that the environment and location of schools makes a difference. Issues such as the location of the school and the type of parents who send their children to that school will determine how easy it is to raise funds. For example, my school used to educate subnormal children. We took children from poor backgrounds. We found it difficult to raise funds, whereas other schools in more affluent areas found it easier because the parents were more affluent. That produces discrepancies in different schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Wednesday, we went on a Select Committee visit to Hertfordshire. We were pleasantly surprised at the provisions made by the LEA. One school for the physically handicapped that we visited raised £80,000 for the school fund—that is almost as much as some schools get in their capital allocation allowance. Some schools raise funds and can give their kids a far better chance while other schools find it harder to raise funds. I do not begrudge that money going into that school, but, it is so unfair and makes life difficult for other schools that are trying to compete in the same atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most importantly, the introduction of pupil-led funding has exposed the disparities in levels of available finance to schools. The available money varies significantly between schools—even between schools of the same size. I shall give examples of that; they have been carefully researched to ensure that the criteria was exactly the same for each secondary school in different LEAs. I shall pick one school at random: The Haydock high school in St. Helens has 738 pupils. It has no sixth form and its budget is £1,421,441. Holgate school in Barnsley has 792 pupils
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
and no sixth form and its budget is £1·3 million—a difference of £106,000 between two schools in separate authority areas. Resources for Haydock school are greater than those for Holgate, yet they are similar schools, providing a similar service, with almost the same number of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another example, in which the discrepancy is even greater. The Marches school, in Shropshire, has 1,146 pupils. Again it has no sixth form, and its budget is £2·26 million. Tameside local education authority's Two Trees school has 1,122 pupils. Its budget is £1·744 million—a difference of £500,000. How can it be regarded as fair distribution of resourcing if one school has £500,000 more to spend than another school in another LEA? Those are two examples of secondary schools. There are similar astronomic differences in funding for primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has highlighted discrepancies among LEAs. Therefore, is he not arguing for the abolition of LEAs and funding of schools by alternative means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that I would not argue for the abolition of LEAs. He has not listened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question shows the Conservative's attitude to LEAs, which they wish to abolish. I do not know why they did not introduce a Bill for the purpose. Why do it through the back door? I argue for resources from the Government through the rate support grant on a fair standard spending assessment basis rather than some local authorities having to charge their council tax payers more to help provide education. I want a national formula that would give each school the same opportunities and the same funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend fear that if LEAs were removed, all funding would be at the lower level and the power of the LEA to spend more than the Government deemed necessary would be taken from local people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend, because that is what the amendment is all about. We are confident that the majority of LEAs provide resources from their total budget. What worries us is that if the funding agency takes control and the Government fund the agency centrally, those funds may not be adequate to provide a minimum service. I am delighted, Sir John, that you have had a word to confirm that I was keeping within the rules of order. I am sure that if I had not been, you would have risen to keep me in my place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not tempt me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to see you in the Chair, Sir John. I know that you are such a fair Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that to all the Chairmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have added the national funding agency to the national curriculum but they have not allowed for nationally agreed minimum funding for all schools. I put that point to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) because of his intervention.
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
The absence of clear guidelines on the Government's proposals for funding grant-maintained schools is hardly helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that, whichever mechanism is chosen, the funding will have regard to the minimum amount of resources that a school needs to deliver good quality education. The amendment would limit the size of classes because the larger the class the less attention a teacher can give to a child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of classes is increasing. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) told the Committee that, according to statistics from Smith square, pupil numbers were declining. If that is so, why are class sizes increasing? There is now an opportunity to make classes smaller and give pupils far more individual attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government offer ever more information about the size of classes—the key to improving education—but class sizes continue to rise. The Prime Minister told the National Union of Teachers in a letter last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To lay down class sizes would make for inefficient use of teachers. Schools that manage their own budgets have every incentive to make the best use of available resources."</p></blockquote>
Yet local management of schools requires that schools be funded almost entirely according to the number of pupils on schools' rolls. For each child admitted, a fixed sum is added to the school budget. Schools are therefore faced with the difficult choice of allowing class sizes to rise or turning away money to fund schools. This development justifies further acceptance of class size limits, which have been agreed between all teachers organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 25 per cent. of primary school-age children are in classes of more than 30. Even in secondary schools, where the number of pupils is falling, 10 per cent. of pupils are in classes of more than 30. Limits are necessary to give all children a fair chance under the national curriculum and the testing procedures. Lower-size classes relieve stress and mounting pressure on teachers. This is an important factor because stress and pressure have a detrimental effect on the ability to teach and on standards in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, there was an estimated £3 billion backlog of repairs and replacements necessary to put schools in a decent condition. Current estimates are as high as £6 billion. Although grant-maintained schools have done well, if more schools opt out of LEAs and move to central control, funds will dry up. I do not think that the 300 per cent. increase in capital expenditure on grant-maintained schools—as opposed to the 10 per cent. increase for LEA schools—can continue. The difference illustrates the Government's unfair allocating of capital resources. The system will not continue because when more schools opt out—which I hope does not happen but which I suspect will because of the bribery aspect—the vast difference in allocations will quickly cease as less money becomes available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Inspectors and Educational Advisers recently said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hundreds of schools should be closed because of the serious defects, if they were subject to the same standards used to declare homes unfit for habitation."</p></blockquote>
Many of the schools in which our children are educated are unfit for human habitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can substantiate that remark. I recently visited a school in my constituency which had black, rising damp on the walls and water running into electric sockets. Children had to use toilets that were an absolute disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
That is not merely a one-off occurrence in my constituency—there are schools like that throughout the country. All hon. Members know of similar examples in their constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not expect our children to work in dangerous buildings that are not waterproof and that are inadequate to meet the needs of the national curriculum. Standards for maintenance, repair and replacement of school buildings must be enforced.

I shall quote from a report by the National Audit Office entitled, "Repair and Maintenance of School Buildings," published on 25 July 1991. It is a long passage, but it is so important that I shall put it on the record. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A survey based upon local education authorities' own assessments and published by the Department of Education and Science in 1986 reported that 38 per cent. of primary schools sampled and 24 per cent. of secondary schools sampled needed work on roofs, or heating systems, or walls and windows. The cost of bringing school buildings up to the accommodation standards denned in the School Premises Regulations for 1991 pupil numbers and to an acceptable state of repair was estimated to be £2 billion at November 1987 prices. The cost of structural repairs and maintenance alone was estimated to be £730 million to £995 million at November 1987 prices.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Schools consider that good education can occur in some of the poorest accommodation. But they have commented in their reports over the last decade on the adverse effects on the quality of education caused by buildings which are unsuitable for current educational demands, and badly maintained accommodation. They have suggested that these circumstances may adversely affect morale and do nothing to stimulate and encourage pupils to give of their best and raise their levels of achievement, or to attract to the teaching profession able and enthusiastic teachers."</p></blockquote>
That report is an indictment of our education system. It is deplorable that enough money cannot be put into the education service to ensure that our children are educated in reasonable accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions facing children in schools every day include outside toilets, no running water, rooms for practical activities without power points, water running down the walls into electric wires. Any allocation of funds to grant-maintained schools must take account of the necessity for decent standards of school buildings to end the decay and inadequacy that Her Majesty's Inspectorate identified in 1987 and in every year since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations governing school buildings were laid down 11 years ago by this Government for the protection of students and teachers, but they deferred until 1996 the enforcement of those regulations for schools built before 1981. In other words, it does not matter that children continue to be educated in the most foul of conditions; the Government are not prepared to give schools the resources that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that, at least, the Government are forced to fund grant-maintained schools to minimum standards. Guaranteed standards for all schools must be laid down and resourced, so that every child has a fair chance and equal opportunities. Minimum standards of provision must apply to all schools. However, the funding agency should determine funding levels and grants to schools to ensure that grant-maintained schools attain certain levels of provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to consider the issue of resources from the point of view of one county in England that, for a reason that I have not yet determined, has sent me many letters on the subject, specifically about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
resourcing of primary education. As my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said, the amendment would place a duty on the funding authority to ensure that there are minimum standards of provision in schools. The Committee may find it enlightening if I describe the situation in Avon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects, Avon is a good example, and it is more than a happy coincidence that I have received all those letters. According to the Government's assessments, the county of Avon spends £40 million—or 12 per cent.—more than its standard spending assessment for education. Avon is generous towards its schools and offers the best nursery education of any county in England—all four-year-olds and most three-year-olds have a place in a nursery school or unit. What makes Avon county so relevant to the amendment is that it boasts proudly that all county-maintained schools have better funding than any grant-maintained school in neighbouring Gloucestershire, which is not a Labour authority. The letters that I have received from Avon about the provision of books, teachers and other aids are highly pertinent to this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former chairman of the county of Avon's education committee I am delighted to hear much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but he must bear in mind that in the current financial year, the county has had to cut its budget for schools by 4 per cent. because of Government rate-capping legislation. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the county treasurer estimates that a further cut of 8 per cent. will be necessary in the next financial year, for the same reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make precisely that point: the county of Avon has suffered from rate capping for several years. That is causing difficulties with resources, which are felt by the county's schools. Even so, those schools still receive higher funding than any grant-maintained school in Gloucestershire. I shall mention the schools or clusters of schools that have written to me, and then I shall pick out some relevant points in their letters without making a specific attribution. The schools include the Filton area head teacher cluster group, the Hambrook county primary school, the Headley park county primary school, the Charborough road county primary school, High Down junior school, Bank Leaze infants school, South Weston schools cluster group, Ashcombe county primary school, Milton infants school, Uphill primary school, Yeo Moor infants school and Oldbury court infants school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That list shows that a substantial number of schools have written to me. The letters have been written either by head teachers on behalf of governing bodies and other staff, or by the chairman of the governing body on behalf of the governors and the staff. A typical letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A unanimous decision was taken at a meeting of the … group … to forward a joint statement of protest at the serious underfunding of Primary Education in the County of Avon, to people in positions of authority having the power to influence political decisions."</p></blockquote>
I am slightly flattered to be placed in that category. On Government funding, the letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government funding for all sectors of Education is inadequate. In Primary Schools this has resulted in large classes, inadequate numbers of General Assistants to support Class teachers in the classroom, insufficient resources, uncomfortable, over-crowded classrooms often in buildings which are in need of modernisation or basic repair and maintenance … Underfunding at the present level, if it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
allowed to continue, will result in a lowering of standards in Primary Education and make the delivery of the National Curriculum an impossible task".</p></blockquote>
The letter continues that head teachers,
	<br><blockquote><p>"would like to place on record a joint statement to the effect that Government requirements will not be effectively delivered if these demands are not matched with adequate funding."</p></blockquote>
Severe funding problems already exist in our schools. The amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham tabled is especially apposite, because it would set out benchmarks below which resource provision should not fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter from another school deals with "serious underfunding". It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government funding for all sectors of education is inadequate. In primary schools this has resulted in large class sizes, inadequate numbers of General Assistants, insufficient resources and over crowded classrooms."</p></blockquote>
The chairman of governors says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are very fortunate in having a Parent Teacher Association which raises funds for the school. In the past these funds were used to provide many of the extras appreciated by the children, e.g. musical instruments, an extra computer. Today the P.T.A. is funding basic educational resources, the provision of which should be the responsibility of the Department for Education … if the underfunding of education is allowed to continue it will inevitably result in a lowering of standards and make the delivery of the National Curriculum an impossible task."</p></blockquote>
Another school governor wishes,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to express our deep concern over the basic level of funding of Primary Schools."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman spell out what he believes to be the connection between funding and results—not simply academic results? The Inner London education authority spent twice as much as the average authority and produced results that were half as good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the two counties that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, Avon spends £1,940 per pupil and Gloucestershire £1,910 per pupil. However, 40 per cent. of Gloucestershire pupils obtain five grade A to C GCSEs, whereas 36·1 per cent. of Avon pupils attain such grades. The supposed connection between funding and results does not stand up. Funding is important, but there are other methods, such as efficient use of resources, and good teachers, of producing a good end product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly to the intervention of the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). There are two separate issues to consider. In the letters that I have received, teachers and governors are worried that the level of funding, although it is relatively generous for England as a whole, is nevertheless causing serious problems for the effective delivery of the national curriculum and education in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a separate but important point on the resources that an LEA needs to provide an effective curriculum and to produce good results. No education researcher would expect a high correlation between the level of spending and education results because different circumstances in different LEAs govern the level of spending required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is precisely right. The purpose of spending assessments is to take account of the needs of the area. That is why in the area of inner London that I represent, more—about £2,500 per pupil—is spent
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
on providing a sufficient standard of education, irrespective of which party is in control. I thought that we were comparing two counties in which, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, the needs were comparable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that. My point is that the county of Avon has greater needs because it has areas of deprivation requiring special help, but despite the fact that it has a higher level of spending there is consensus—especially in the primary sector, but the letters also refer to the secondary sector—about the difficulties of delivering an effective national curriculum across the country. That is the moot point. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure minimum standards of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another head teacher says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have been given responsibilities and accountability now we need the resources to be effective. The whole thrust of the National Curriculum initiative, on which the Government pins the ultimate salvation of the country, will be blunted and put at risk on the current level of funding."</p></blockquote>
He notes some of the specific steps that his school has had to take, such as to increase class sizes to ensure that it keeps within the budget. He is concerned about providing the proper level of help for children with special needs and about the fact that this year he has been forced to operate a deficit budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the governors of another school writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Governors this year have had to reduce the number of class teachers from nine to eight, and have had to take £15,000 from our very limited reserves in order to manage."</p></blockquote>
He points out why some of these difficulties have occurred.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The allocation of funds by Avon County to the School fails to take into account the fact that we have an experienced staff whose salaries are close to, or at the top of, their pay scales."</p></blockquote>
Avon county had to do that because under LMS the allocation is based on average teacher salaries and not on the actual salaries paid in the school. The problem of salaries is important, especially given its implications for limiting class sizes. That school has had to lose one of its teachers. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The governors of this school are desperately worried about the present situation, which has meant that we have classes with 34 children in them, far more than we had before L.M.S. when Avon County worked on a pupil/teacher ratio of 27·4.</p></blockquote>
The Governors are even more concerned about the coming years where it is feared that Avon County will reduce the funding to this School to an even lower level, forcing us to reduce the teaching strength and increase class sizes to an even more unacceptable level.
	<br><blockquote><p>These further reductions are having to be brought about as a direct result of Government decisions."</p></blockquote>
The Government will decide how much money the funding authority has at its disposal to pass on to grant-maintained schools. The record of the maintained sector proves that it is vital to accept the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, which sets benchmarks for the necessary provision. The hon. Member for Bath mentioned the problems of capping which Avon experienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another chair of governors states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing … to express profound concern about the basic level of funding for primary education in England … As governors, we support the Government's aim that every child in this country should have the very best start in life but our personal experience causes us to believe primary children's education is in jeopardy unless more realistic funding is made available from central funds."</p></blockquote>
We return to the provision of funding from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
A head teacher from a cluster group of schools states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing … to express great concern at the current underfunding of education in general and in the primary sector in particular."</p></blockquote>
He continues to cite the items causing frustration which were on the agenda of their cluster group meeting of head teachers: the former allocation, which meant that no one thought that their budgets were adequate; the reductions in special needs provision; the worsening pupil-teacher ratio; and the inadequacy of the allocation for the schools' in-service training, particularly for appraisals, on which the Government set so much store to improve the standards of teachers and the delivery of education in our schools. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope you will be able to take our concerns to your colleagues in politics, to see if this issue of underfunding in education can be addressed. This would go some way towards lifting morale."</p></blockquote>
I am carrying out the head teacher's wishes by informing my friends and colleagues in politics about the difficulties experienced in just one county, which, among county authorities, is a relatively generous provider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another head teacher states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We feel totally frustrated in trying to even hold on to the good will and dedication of teachers (and, eventually, parents) in the light of the inevitable erosion of quality given the present level of primary funding."</p></blockquote>
The concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham are serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another chairman of a governing body states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I feel I must write regarding the lack of funding in primary education … If further reductions occur in future then the only options available to us would be to consider staff redundancies, this in turn would mean a larger number of children per class, less or no non-contact time for teachers, less or no general assistant support for teachers etc … If it were not for the generous support of the PTA, the school would be lacking in vital basic equipment. We should not have to rely on voluntary support to support the school budget. We feel that the Government should face up to its responsibilities and provide the necessary funding for the basic requirements in order that the National Curriculum can be offered to our children in the most beneficial way, i.e. no cuts in school budgets for staffing or equipment."</p></blockquote>
The case for resourcing is graphically put by head teachers and governors in Avon. Another head teacher wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For years schools and Governing Bodies have been forced to 'make-do-and-mend' because of the basic underfunding in Education and in particular in the Primary Sector … The proposed cuts for next year's budget are bound to result in a worsening of the pupil: teacher ratio, job losses and less support for Special Needs children. Other areas are bound to suffer.</p></blockquote>
We hope you will use your position to pass on to your colleagues in politics the strong feeling that there is in schools, that education in general is underfunded and particularly so in Primary Schools."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One primary school went so far as to write, on behalf of its governors, to the Prime Minister and to the Department for Education. I am sure that the Minister will be aware of the first letter that the school wrote, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing on behalf of the Governors of the above school to express our concerns on the under-funding of education generally and in particular the effects on the Primary Sector."</p></blockquote>
Finally, another head teacher wrote, on behalf of the school's staff and governing body:
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"With the background of £1½ million being spent on publishing exam results we would like to draw your attention to the level of central funding for primary children's education."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to point out the increasing difficulty that the school is having in providing for children with special needs, in ensuring that record keeping of assessments under the national curriculum is carried out properly and in maintaining under-fives provision at the level that ensures the best possible start for children entering school at four plus. The letter concludes with this sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Can I make the point that unfortunately with the best will in the world the bottom line is that time means money and we must not let primary budgets be further eroded."</p></blockquote>
That illustrates graphically that there is unanimity across the county that, even at present levels of funding, there are serious problems in delivering a good quality of education and in ensuring that the national curriculum is taught properly in schools and that children with special needs—especially those without statements—are provided for properly. However, we must also consider carefully the impact on teachers of the underfunding and lack of facilities. Much has been said in the press about the problems caused to teachers by the introduction of the national curriculum in primary schools. David Pascall, the head of the National Curriculum Council, has expressed his serious worries and reservations about the way in which what he described as "overload" in the national curriculum was putting unacceptable strain and stress on teachers. Unfortunately, in far to many schools across the country, not only in Avon, there are reports of class sizes being increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A little closer to home, the London 	<i>Evening Standard</i> recently included a report about an impending crisis in the borough of Harrow. The crisis arises from a dispute with the Department for Education about how much should be taken out of Harrow's education budget to take account of further education spending. There is a difference of £7 million between what the borough of Harrow and the Department for Education believe should be taken out. The outlook for education resources in Harrow next year is bleak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is talk in Harrow of ending nursery provision and taking at least one teacher from every school in the borough. That has serious implications for class sizes and the amount of non-contact time that a primary school teacher can expect. When I sat on the Committee that considered the Education Reform Act 1988, which introduced the national curriculum, and assessment and testing, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) said that he would try to give primary school teachers 10 per cent. non-contact time in recognition of the burdens that the national curriculum would place upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going a little wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John, if that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the items specified in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham is
	<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient resources to limit class sizes to a level prescribed by orders".</p></blockquote>
I will try to keep to the issues raised in the amendment. When the so-called great education Bill was debated, the Government acknowledged the extra burdens that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
would place on primary school teachers. Class sizes are increasing in many primary schools because of funding problems. It is important to consider that in the context of my hon. Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of class size and numbers of teachers, we should consider the number of teachers available to teach children with special needs. I raised the matter during a meeting of a statutory instrument committee, which the Minister and I had the pleasure of attending last Wednesday. I pointed out that a survey carried out by the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf revealed different levels of support for children with hearing problems. I isolated some of the best and worst provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best provision included one LEA that ensured one teacher for fewer than six children with hearing impairment; and another that provided a teacher for fewer than four children with hearing impairment. At the other end of the scale, in some LEAs the level of support was 1:21, 1:34 and 1:86. There may be reasons for such vast differences, but whatever they are, there is a clear case for ensuring that there are minimum pupil-teacher ratios.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point which I would like him to expand. There is a secondary school for the deaf, Oak Lodge, near the border of my constituency. It does not appear in any tables because although it is run by the borough of Wandsworth it provides a service for many other London boroughs, the spending per pupil is quite high, not necessarily in terms of pupil-teacher ratio, but more because of wiring for sound, the school's state-of-the-art facilities for deaf children. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman hopes to prove by quoting the overall tables. Clearly, it depends on a child's hearing problem whether it needs more or less teaching time or more support of a different nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the anxiety that the hon. Gentleman expresses. We may later debate the relative funding needed for special needs education, although it will not be a lengthy debate because of the guillotine motion. In south Wales counties in the industrial areas have a remarkably similar number of children with hearing impairment problems. It could be argued that it reflects the higher levels of deprivation; I am not an expert on the incidence of hearing impairment problems in different local authority areas, but I would guess that there are not huge differences in the needs of children with hearing problems. There could, however, be some differences, depending on the relative wealth of the local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obvious differences in the ratios of 1:4 and 1:86 mean that questions must be asked about the resourcing of education for children with hearing impairment. I do not suggest that every local authority should have one teacher to four children or that every local authority could be comfortable with one teacher for 85 children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that there were minimum standards for the provision of sufficient books and equipment. For children with hearing impairment, equipment is essential. In the past 15 years, tremendous strides have been made in the provision of equipment to help children with hearing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equipment is an issue for children with various disabilities. The type of equipment available in a school is a vital matter for those children. In some cases, the statement for a child with a disability will specify equipment and such equipment should be provided in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
reasonable time. I know of one or two isolated cases in which there have been long delays between the provision being specified in a statement and suitable equipment coming to hand. I have taken up such cases with my LEA. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham is extremely important. It could break new ground by specifying minimum standards. Previous education Acts have placed generalised duties on LEAs to provide education for children but have not set minimum standards of class size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look on the amendment positively. It would ensure that when the funding authority came into being and exercised its powers it would have guidelines on minimum standards of provision which it would be able to use when monitoring the effective delivery of good-quality education in grant-maintained schools and the efficient use of resources provided. I look forward to the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the excellent amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham with his usual sagacity, pragmatism and good sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by referring to the position which we are now in and then to the position which we will be in if the Bill is passed. Currently, we have an unfair system for allocating expenditure on books, buildings and facilities within schools—it is called the standard spending assessment. I do not blame the Minister for the SSA because it is not within his gift, although no doubt the Secretary of State and people in education fight their corner extremely well. We have the absurd situation in which less money is spent per pupil in areas such as Wakefield metropolitan district council than in Westminster. It is sheer absurdity to compare a place that has considerable social problems and high unemployment with a relatively rich semi-city centre that has the resources to do well by its people and to serve its pupils well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That system is intolerable. If the Minister is attempting to put that right, it is a very good thing. But we know that when a system is administered centrally, economies tend to be made which eventually reach down to the bottom and cause problems. We want to lay down minimum acceptable standards. The amendment may concentrate the Minister's mind on the realities in the classroom and on what expenditure is needed. For example, ducks and drakes has been played with the national curriculum, and that has led to enormous overspend in some schools. The Minister's proposed system of grant-maintained schools, with their funding agencies, could lead to the bankruptcy of schools. There is a balance between the minimum requirement and the effects of the policies directed from the centre, particularly in reference to the curriculum. We should explore some issues relating to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the weekend, the Minister mentioned the special concentration that schools could make on the arts and on games—that has not been unanimously popular. If one runs a successful games school, with a panoply of available sporting activities, they become extremely expensive. If one wanted to pursue more esoteric sports, such as lacrosse, it was customary to raise cash through raffles, summer fairs and so on. Those sports were considered to be the fringe activities. Under the Minister's new proposals, they will be the core activities, so considerable extra funding will be needed. For example, because so few
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
schools play lacrosse, the capital costs and the costs of equipment and travelling will be high. How does the Minister intend to fund it? In such specialist schools, will money perhaps be taken from providing books to financing sport? I have no objection to schools making their name in sports, but such a school can take money from areas included in the amendment, such as class sizes, quality of teaching, and sufficient books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister introduce a curriculum control in games, such as has been introduced in English? It might be so diversifying and altering that a school will not be able to settle down properly unless, from time to time, it has extra funding, and that goes against the whole grain of the Minister's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke of sport. Has he thought of the resourcing implications of schools that are ordered to buy books, such as Bill Beaumont's "Better Rugby"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not uppermost in my mind, but, here after, I shall give it careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is keen on the specialisations of art and music. There are funding difficulties in those areas. In Hemsworth, we do not have a million art galleries and we do not have a million symphony orchestras. Therefore, if children of the constituency are to go to art galleries or listen to good music, the implications of the travel costs are considerable and that area has very poor public transport communications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for raising the issue of art galleries and museums. Has he received a letter from the Museums Association, expressing grave anxiety about the future of museums under the new regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have and, purely by chance, I have the letter with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate that to the amendment. I am a little dubious about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. We are talking about the essentials for education and the expenditure that is involved. We have proposed a minimum level of expenditure. If it does not allow for travel to hear symphony orchestras, or to visit art galleries, or to share the maintenance of educational museums, all will be in vain. One of our serious worries about the funding agencies is that they will so fragment the system of public education that we shall no longer be able to build upon the essential cultural requirements that must also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister often appears to consider the teaching of children as if it were a quiz rather than their education. For that museums are needed and they need funds to keep going. I urge the hon. Gentleman to consider these three extremely important aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far back as the old West Riding days, a cultural context for schools was established. It offered great possibilities. There was also informal funding for access to cultural facilities. Those have been destroyed to some extent by the abolition of the West Riding. I fear that such facilities will be further destroyed unless a safeguard such as the amendment proposes is adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) has spoken about the size of classes. I merely add that it is crucial that some subject courses be of limited
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
size. Practical chemistry classes for a group of 40 would be pointless, first because there are rarely 40 places at which people can conduct individual experiments, and, secondly because it is impossible for a teacher to participate and to coach as he should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is not a point of order for me in the sense that a quorum is the number of members of the Committee that I see from the Chair, irrespective of which side of the Committee they sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come, Sir John, to one of my favourite subjects, the funding of minority subjects. I think of Greek especially. It is unlikely that more than, say, a dozen people will take classical Greek in one year; exceptionally there will be 20, given a school's usual span.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the subject to be taught therefore, the average size of a class needs to appear relatively low. That must be considered when the average ratio of teachers to pupils is set, and it can be expensive. In their attempt to cut corners, all too often the Government suggest that a subject is uneconomic. That practice would be disastrous for the future of subjects such as Hebrew, classical Greek, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of whether teachers are sufficiently well qualified worries me greatly. In my earlier days I was greatly involved in teaching in the private sector. Far too often private schools employed unqualified teachers, especially in music and art—where the sector has made such great strides—to the detriment of the children. In one instance, the people who taught were 50 per cent. unqualified. There is clearly a temptation, under a grant-maintained system—especially if a school is facing bankruptcy—to use unqualified staff. It is important to remember that some schools are facing bankruptcy already, under LMS. I hope that the Minister has urgent plans to help such schools when they apply for grant-maintained status as a sort of rescue from bankruptcy. Minimum funding should be such as to maintain 100 per cent. qualified teachers and to allow for specialist experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The older the teacher, the more valuable he is, because he has greater experience. Equally, such teachers are more expensive. There is a rush away from well-qualified teachers because LMS is already holding them back at a certain level. Therefore, the eminently sensible suggestions of my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham should be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that the primary school that I attended had outside lavatories for boys and girls. The school was promised that lavatories would be incorporated closer to the building so that the children would not suffer the excesses of winter freeze-ups. But, after 20 years, it still has outside lavatories because of a lack of capital investment. It is crucial to include in the Bill protection for the many such schools that are more concentrated in socially deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, some primary and middle schools are an absolute disgrace in this day and age, and they pose all sorts of problems for teachers, pupils and ancillary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
staff. The standard of cleaning in these schools is remarkable; indeed, it is all that keeps the schools going. This is part of the expenditure on the upkeep of the fabric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we cast off these schools into independence, or whatever we wish to call it, we should guarantee a minimum standard. We must guarantee a capital allocation to allow schools to be brought up to standard. That is not to say that good education cannot be given in an old, badly built, crumbling or decaying school. It can, and it is, because of dedicated teaching, but it takes a tremendous amount out of the teachers and does not enhance the children's performance. Minimum standards should be agreed before the schools become independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implicit in all this is the fact that I am extremely worried about what will happen to the free school meals that in some schools are allocated to a large number of pupils. In my area, where there is great unemployment, many children are entitled to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is stretching the patience of the Chair a little. School meals do not figure in the amendment, to which I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can relate his present remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that schools with a budget—school meals provision is separate under local management of schools—which included the provision of free meals would find it difficult to choose between such meals and books. Once again, however, it would be a matter of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Libraries are essential to the provision of books, but there is much concern about them. Under local management of schools, some schools are not only lessening the attention that they give to their libraries but are abolishing them altogether and using the space for more economic pursuits. That is especially common where schools get grants from local industry and reshape rooms to cater for special engineering needs and technical advances. We must guarantee the provision of school libraries to shore them up, or serious harm will be done—albeit not deliberately but evil affects can stem also from an innocent approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Educational visits are important in deprived areas. Children who grow up in a small society must be given the opportunity to see the world outside. Funding for such visits has often been provided through extra activities, such as raffles and fairs in the summer and at Christmas. If schools are to spend their extra money on books, teachers or buildings, activities such as educational visits will be abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to the subject of games. Games, as well as music and music-making, are important in school life, even in schools that do not specialise in those pursuits. If central Government expenditure is mean as a result of ignorance of what is happening in schools, such so-called inessential activities—which are not geared to testing or GCSEs—will be lost. That would be serious. Taking part in rugby, lacrosse, hockey or netball, or playing in jazz bands or school symphony orchestras are all part and parcel of the fabric of school life. That would be threatened if the minimum standards proposed in the amendment were not met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham. The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill and reveals
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
the greatest deficiency in the Bill as drafted. The Bill is about organisational and bureaucratic change. It does nothing to improve the quality of our children's education. The amendment would rectify that deficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency will not be democratically accountable to local people and the communities that depend on good schooling. There is a danger that, without the pressure of the democratic process, the funding agency will not be overly concerned about having sufficient books in the class room, about class sizes and about the state of school buildings. We do not know whether the funding agency will have any notion of what provision there will be in different localities; that will depend on whether the funding agency is to be regional or more local.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The undemocratic nature of the funding agency means that a safeguard is needed to ensure that it meets minimum standards in providing the bare essentials of a good education service. At present, the Government lay down a standard spending assessment for each local education authority in England and Wales. It is the amount that the Government believe to be necessary to provide a sufficient education in each local authority area. The Government will require the funding agency to work within the standard spending assessment that they consider adequate to provide a decent standard of education. At present, fortunately, the majority of LEAs ignore their education standard spending assessment and, in the Government's definition, overspend on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to figures produced by the Department for the Environment, in this financial year 65 LEAs overspent their standard spending assessment by some £524 million. What will happen if those LEAs are part of the funding agency regime? Given that it will be appointed solely by the Secretary of State, it is unlikely that the agency will ignore the Government's instructions. The funding agency will comply with the Government's requirements for funding. That will have serious implications for the quality of education offered in those 65 LEA area. For that reason, the Bill must include a safeguard such as that proposed in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the election of a Conservative Government in 1979, an ever-decreasing percentage of our national wealth is spent on education. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's autumn statement confirmed that trend. Education has received a lower-than-average share of the percentage increase in Government spending on services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That all too starkly demonstrates the Government's commitment to education. It emphasises that the Government are not overly anxious about the quality of education that our schools offer. In the increase in standard spending assessments that was outlined in the autumn statement, spending on education increased by a lower percentage than that on other services. Our system is under-resourced and we need to provide some safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Opposition Members, even those from a local authority background, would accept that minimum standards should be introduced not only for a funding agency but for LEAs, provided that LEAs would have an opportunity to improve above the minimum statutory standard. There are no minimum standards for LEAs but at least they are subject to the pressure of the democratic process. The funding agency will not be subject to that pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education service has been starved of important resources for many years. The figures reveal that clearly.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
Conservative Members claim that the percentage increase in money for education has reduced because the school population has decreased. That argument could be used to explain why teacher numbers have dropped. In 1990 and 1991, the number of qualified teachers in England dropped by 4,287. However, a corresponding drop did not occur in the school population. The pupil-teacher ratio in England worsened for the first time since 1964.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be less selective. The pupil-teacher ratio has improved significantly since 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the figures are broken down, LEA by LEA, they show that the improvement occurred because Labour-controlled LEAs ignored the Government's standard spending assessments, at the risk of being capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, that is misleading. Like many other Conservative-controlled LEAs, Croydon LEA, on which I served for 16 years, has a good record of improving its PTR since 1979. Whatever the spending of Conservative-controlled LEAs, their examination results are far better than those of the Labour-controlled LEAs that the hon. Gentleman praises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not address the issue that he raised originally—the pupil-teacher ratio. There is a clear correlation between Labour-controlled LEAs and more teachers and smaller classes. From a sedentary position the Minister says that Labour-controlled LEAs have lousy results. I pray in aid the headmaster of Millfield school, which is a leading private school. In a letter to 	<i>The Times</i> he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any head, given a free choice as to how best to improve the standard of education at school, would opt to improve the pupil-teacher ratio."</p></blockquote>
That argument puts the Minister in his place. Most people recognise that a reduction in pupil-teacher ratios improves the quality of education offered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about Millfield school, which believes in improved pupil-teacher ratios. It is one of the most expensive schools in the country. It has one of the smallest pupil-teacher ratios, so why is it nowhere near the top of the results table except perhaps in swimming, tennis or other specialist areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Battersea knows that Millfield takes pupils with a wide range of academic ability. That is why it is not at the top of the league table on examination performance, but in other areas it does well. The argument is well made by the hon. Member for Battersea. He should endorse the value-added approach to league tables for which Opposition Members have argued for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify the point on pupil-teacher ratios, particularly in relation to Labour and Conservative-controlled authorities. An authority such as Croydon, which has one of the worst pupil-teacher ratios, also has a city technology college with one of the worst records on examination results in maths and technical subjects. Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to comment on the relationship between the CTC, examination results and pupil-teacher ratios in boroughs such as Croydon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CTC in question is the Harris CTC, which was so successful this summer that it did not achieve a single GCSE pass at grade A or B in technology or mathematics. That is a good example of how the Government's initiatives raise standards in our schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was very instructive. It showed how Labour Members are quick to point the finger at Conservative Members for naming a school that is not up to standard, but they are able to criticise CTCs, which extend choice and which they detest. Many of the pupils at Harris CTC who took examinations this summer started their education when it was a council-run school. It became a city technology college to improve standards, and it will do that in the longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot debate CTCs under this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the important matter of standards in schools. It is interesting to note that the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East has accepted that standards in that school cannot be defended. Resources are all important in raising standards in schools. If standards are improved, it may be because of the additional resources obtained as a result of the Government's discrimination in favour of their initiatives and against those of LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years an ever decreasing amount of the national wealth has gone into our education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it could be shown that the move to grant-maintained status led to increased resources for schools, would the hon. Gentleman support such a move?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have challenged the Minister to say whether the £524 million overspend on education—as the Government would have it—will go into the school system. He has refused to give an assurance that that additional public expenditure will be made available. Only the Minister can tell us that, and his silence is very instructive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made a fundamental mistake when he launched the White Paper. Under the guise of a gratuitous attack on spending by Birmingham city council, he made the point that local authorities would be funded at existing levels and those that had underspent on their SSA would have that level increased forcibly to bring it to the level of their SSA. The Government cannot have it both ways. Is every LEA, and therefore every funding agency, to be financed on the basis of their SSA? If so, more than £0·5 billion will be cut from 64 LEAs. We have heard nothing from the Minister. We understand that the Government are to issue a consultation paper, perhaps before Christmas, or just after. We do not know the answer because the Government have not stated with any clarity their intentions about funding grant-maintained sector. We must be told about that important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of resources for schools over many years has meant that the quality of education has been severely reduced. The strong point of the amendment is that it identifies the three areas that are of special concern to parents—books, buildings and class size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Educational Publishers Council, an independent body, has said that spending on school books has reached crisis point, which concerns it greatly. Spending on books
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
is especially important at present because of the frequent changes in curriculum which all too often necessitate additional spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent decision by the Secretary of State that three Shakespeare plays—"Romeo and Juliet", "Julius Caesar" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream"—are to be studied by 14-year-olds will have resource implications, because a school that does not have those books will have to buy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maintenance of school buildings is linked to the amount of capital that an LEA is allowed to spend. I understand that in the coming few days we shall be told the amount of capital allocation for individual LEAs in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be instructive to consider the way in which capital allocation to local authorities generally has dropped over the past 12 years. The system of allocating that funding has changed. Until 1989, it was based on capital allocation and since then it has been based on a capital guideline. It is still a measure within which local authorities must operate. Until now they have not had power to go beyond the Government's capital allocation or guideline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are based on 1991–92 prices so as to give a proper comparison. In 1981–82, £633,000 of capital allocation was made available to schools in England, but by 1992–93 the figure had dropped to a guideline of £565,000. That is a clear illustration of how the capital being spent in schools in England, at least, has dropped dramatically over 12 years as a direct consequence of Government policies. The figures are determined centrally, and local authorities must comply. As a result of under-resourcing, not only do individual schools have problems maintaining their buildings but a massive backlog of capital works needs to be undertaken. The LEAs have calculated that an additional £4 billion is needed to return those schools into an adequate state of repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1981 should have been implemented last year. Those regulations set minimum standards for the condition of school buildings, which every school should meet. In 1989–90, because of the Government's under-investment, it became clear that those minimum standards would not be satisfied. The Government therefore delayed for a further five years consideration of whether those regulations would be implemented. That is a good illustration of how the Government have neglected spending on school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the autumn statement, the Chancellor said that future capital receipts might be used for capital spending. Why cannot existing capital receipts be used for spending on school buildings? Billions of pounds are tied up in local government bank accounts, but the money cannot be touched because of Treasury rules. We believe that that money should be liberated to improve the quality and standard of school buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would tackle the problem of class size. I said earlier that thousands of qualified teachers were leaving the education service and that as a result the pupil-teacher ratio had worsened. As a consequence, the size of classes is ever increasing. It is instructive to consider the area covered by the Inner London education authority. In the inner-London area in 1989, not one class had more than 40 pupils. Regrettably, that is no longer so. Some classes in inner London now contain more than 40 children. In Scotland, there is a statutory maximum class
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
size. If that is good enough for the children of Scotland, why is it not good enough for the children of England and Wales? The time has come to set a maximum class size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When teachers and their employers could negotiate freely, in the days shortly before the old Burnham primary and secondary committee was abolished, an agreement was about to be concluded that would have introduced a class size requirement to England and Wales. It would not have been easy to achieve, but it could have been phased in. In time, there would have been a requirement that no teacher would be expected to take responsibility for a class of more than a certain number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Keith Joseph, who was then Secretary of State for Education, could confirm that one of the main reasons why the Government stopped those talks and removed the power of teachers and employers to negotiate was that they would not accept the requirement of a maximum class size as part of a conditions-of-service deal. That is a matter of deep regret. Ever since, class sizes have increased. I agree with the head teacher of Millfield school that class size is most significant to the quality of education offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Class sizes have increased and pupil-teacher ratios have worsened over the years, and, as a result, the quality of education has declined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the head teacher of Millfield school. When independent schools advertise, class size is a prominent feature in the advertisement. That emphasises the point made in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham City.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Head teachers of independent schools recognise the value of small classes. Many parents cannot afford private education, yet they want their children to be taught in small classes. The Government deny that to parents. The amendment would remedy the matter by requiring the funding agency to ensure minimum standards for class sizes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with a key issue—resources for schools. It highlights three priorities: books, buildings and class sizes. They are important to parents and teachers, and to the Opposition. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham has tabled the amendment, because it gives the Committee an opportunity to discuss the quality of learning, and the means of improving children's education. Those issues have received insufficient attention in our deliberations. The Bill does not consider the quality of education; it tinkers with the funding arrangements for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's foreword to the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every child in this country should have the very best start in life."</p></blockquote>
No one would question that. The Prime Minister goes on to say that every pupil should have the same opportunities. We all agree with that, however, the Opposition dispute the capacity of the Bill to achieve those aims. The amendment highlights the problem of the funding agency's sensitivity to the needs of local parents when they choose schools. The Opposition have contended that the funding agency will be less sensitive than LEAs to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the criteria on which parents decide to which school to send their children. Last weekend, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
examined some of the documentation that is published to assist parents to make such choices. Parents are asked to consider a lengthy list of items when choosing a school. One item was the state of the physical provision—the buildings and the classrooms. Parents are advised to examine school libraries to ascertain whether there are enough books and whether they are up-to-date. They are told to look inside the cupboards of classrooms to decide whether the books are provided in sufficient supply and are of the right quality. Parents are told to examine specialist areas of schools, such as laboratories or technology areas, to ascertain the quality and sufficiency of resources and equipment. They are advised to consider the number of computers and how they are used in the curriculum. They are also advised to examine the non-teaching provision. What other classroom assistance is there apart from what the teacher provides? That is also important in delivering the curriculum. However, the item of advice that comes at the top of the list is that parents should ask about the class sizes; the school's pupil-teacher ratio and the size of class that children can expect to join. That is the most critical question for parents when exercising their choice of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The events in my constituency in Plymouth are illuminating. What happens when parents are dissatisfied with part of the LEA provision? The LEA in my area was embarking on budget cuts. I shall not go into detail, but it was interesting to witness the campaigning anger expressed by parents of all political persuasions. People argued with local councillors to get those cuts revoked. Equally interesting is the fact that the plans for cuts now have been shelved because the council had to be sensitive to the parents' wishes. Parents realised that the cuts would lower standards and reduce school provision. The county councillors had to rethink the plans because of the pressure from parents. The question that all hon. Members must ask is whether a funding agency—in Darlington or elsewhere—would be as sensitive as an LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In exercising their choice, parents can knock on councillors' doors and talk to their local LEA officials. They can campaign, if they so wish. The campaigns in my part of the world are especially significant because local elections are coming up, in which parents will be able to exercise real choice. They will decide who is to run the local education system. The hon. Member for Battersea spoke earlier about the level of provision, but if parents in the Inner London education authority believed that the authority was spending too much on education, they had the right to vote out the councillors. I note that they did not do so over the years, but that was their right, which they could exercise through the ballot box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chances of parents being able to influence a Labour-controlled body such as ILEA were slim. Parents took the other option of voting with their feet. My borough was in division 10 of ILEA and 40 per cent. of parents there moved their children westwards, out of the ILEA area. That was especially true of parents with children at secondary schools, whom they moved into schools run by London boroughs or counties, where the level of education that they wanted was available. It was not a matter of the amount of money spent, but of the results that were achieved. The ILEA results were abysmal. Now parents are bringing their children back
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
into inner London, so there are more pupils in the classroom. That has an effect on PTRs, but teachers are also returning. The result is that there are now both pupils and teachers in inner-London classrooms. That was not the case under ILEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People who live in the middle of an authority such as Devon do not have the option to move. They cannot exercise that choice. Children at school in Exeter or Oakhampton would have to go 40 or 50 miles to find another authority. However, I shall not get bogged down on this matter. The point is that people in the constituency of the hon. Member for Battersea could exercise choice through the ballot box and make decisions about the education system in their area. There may be reasons other than funding why parents choose not to send their children to local schools. That is down to the local knowledge of those schools and may be peculiar to a particular area. I will not dwell on that matter because I want to stress the relationship between parents and LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the funding agency has no benchmark or criteria on which to base future funding of schools, and if we remove local accountability of schools to parents by removing the powers of the LEA, we could have lower and lower standards as pressure is put on the Government to cut education budgets. The Government would not be sensitive to the needs of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Her Majesty's inspectors, when they were operating in their previous form two or three years ago, consistently complained about the state of school buildings. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) referred to the backlog of repairs to school buildings which was estimated to cost about £4·5 billion. The state of school buildings is important in providing children with a good education. Each day children have to walk into decrepit buildings that are falling apart, have leaking roofs and have buckets on the floor to catch the water. I have seen such schools in my city and beyond. That gives children a hidden message about how much society values their education. Buildings are also important for creating the quality of environment to attract the right professional staff to work in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI commented on the introduction of the national curriculum, especially in areas that required high levels of technical provision, such as science and technology. HMI said that schools had worked hard to get the curriculum in place, but the constant criticism, particularly with regard to primary schools, was that insufficient resources were available to implement the curriculum to the full extent. The curriculum in primary and secondary schools is a long way from the tadpoles in jam jars at the back of the classroom, which is inadequate for the 1990s and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI also highlighted the need at the upper end of primary schools and throughout secondary schools for criteria to be set down for non-teaching assistance in the areas that I have stressed—science, technology and subjects that require the use of sophisticated equipment. That relates to class sizes. A teacher who regularly has class sizes of over 30 will find it impossible to repair and maintain equipment in the classroom on a regular basis. Non-teaching support is important. We should lay down criteria for the use of equipment in science and technology and the extra provision required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern about the Bill is that it removes the important accountability of LEAs to their local voters. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
am worried that the funding agency will be less responsive to local needs. For example, the Government could cut funding to a small primary school in Cornwall, or to any school, in any constituency, without having to take account of the needs and wishes of local people and parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I am in favour of the local management of schools. The problem for schools is not managing their own budgets. The present system is working well in most of the country because of the good work of professionals. However, governors have the power to control budgets and to influence the quality of education in schools only when the budget is big enough. If the budget is too small, it does not matter what good work governors or professionals do, the
