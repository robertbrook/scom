	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>	<b>[Continuation from column 488]</b></p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), has planned for a long night—he has brought his sleeping attire with him—so we shall have some fairly serious debating during the hours between now and daybreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our different ways, the Minister and I were defending the civil service—the Minister half-heartedly, as befits a Minister, and I with genuine applause and appreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend pointed out that the funding authorities will be dominated by people who, because of their backgrounds, are unlikely to have a natural affinity with the different communities of which the authority will have to take account. I suspect that the authorities will begin by recruiting either from the departmental civil service or, possibly, from the local education authorities and, to that extent, will graft from their local knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) spoke about schools in his constituency that had already opted out. One was part of the 50 per cent. that the Government saved from extinction by the unparalleled device of allowing them to be saved at the expense of other schools. Whatever the merits of that device, I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that, in an education authority such as Warwickshire, there are vast differences between parts such as Rugby and Nuneaton. Their communities and attitudes to life are very distinct, and it would be farcial to suggest that a child from the constituency of Rugby and Kenilworth might want to go to a Nuneaton school. That shows that the planning of school places should be decentralised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into detail about Rugby and Kenilworth, but, when my hon. Friend raised the issue, it occurred to me that we face, at a much slower pace in England than in Wales, a move toward unitary authorities. In Wales, where we have a fairly good idea of what will happen, instead of the current eight local education authorities, we shall have more than 20. If there is a similar move in the counties of England to devolve power to smaller, unitary authorities, Rugby and Kenilworth—slightly enlarged—could end up as a unitary authority. The force of my hon. Friend's argument for the amendment is that it looks to the future. Does my hon. Friend want to comment on unitary authorities in the context of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, my hon. Friend has touched on an issue that is central to the amendment. His question should be addressed to Conservative Members. We know
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
the driving force behind the Government's thinking. I do not want to put the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth at odds with his own Front Bench, but I suspect that he may harbour a grudging resentment of Warwickshire county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are talking about Warwickshire, will my hon. Friend accept that the arrangements within Warwickshire county council for the provision of education are an excellent reason for supporting the amendment? Of the five districts within the county of Warwickshire, two retain selective education. Although I do not favour selection and would prefer a comprehensive system, it is clear that Warwickshire county council is reacting to pressure from the districts and to the wishes and needs of local people. The county has retained its diversity in the provision of education. Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment would preserve the right of districts such as the five in Warwickshire to retain the education system that they see fit, and not to impinge on each other's powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, that is a very good point. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said that he believed in diversity and choice in education. I do not know where he heard those words before—I will leave it to the Committee to speculate on that. I do not believe the allegation that he is merely being sycophantic to the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley is right. Decentralisation in Warwickshire county council has allowed different systems to co-exist. I do not believe in the grammar school system, although I am a product of it. Conservative Members get agitated because those of us who came through the grammar school system do not think that it is the best form of education. My local authority retains grammar schools: that is a separate battle that should be played out in a different education debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the hon. Gentleman that I harbour no resentment, grudging or otherwise, against my colleagues on Warwickshire county council. I have much admiration for what they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) referred to diversity. If the hon. Gentleman and hon. Lady have come round to our view that diversity is of great importance, will they explain why, when the Labour party controlled Warwickshire county council, it tried to abolish grammar schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is a fundamentally flawed system of education which fails the majority of pupils. My children went to primary schools in an authority which maintains selective education. My older children are therefore now at comprehensive schools in the neighbouring borough of Manchester. That is the sort of parental choice that the Minister exhorts parents to exercise. However, when we have a Labour Government, I will press my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) to do something about the schools in my constituency so that my constituents have a better education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That day is far, far away. The hon. Gentleman is a member of the Labour party, and no doubt he supports trade unions. The leader of a great teaching trade union said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children themselves know that they are not all equally clever, or musical or competent on the sports field. They expect to be treated differently."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What has that to do with the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is of great relevance, Mr. Martin. It helps to emphasise diversity and choice, which were mentioned by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd). He recognised those important aspects and sought to pray in aid Warwickshire county council. I am showing that his argument was fallacious and had no substance. To further my argument, I was seeking to introduce the comments of a great trade unionist, who I am sure the hon. Gentleman supports. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Selection lies at the heart of good teaching. The life of a comprehensive is not lived on some strange planet populated by identikit children who are all the same. As with every other kind of school, selection is fundamental to its success. As a school becomes more comprehensive in its intake, increasing attention"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment has absolutely nothing to do with selection. That extract is interesting, but it is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that that was what is known in the trade as a planted intervention and that the hon. Gentleman is being got at by his Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assured that that is impossible. I place it on the record that the hon. Gentleman is beyond redemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Incorrigible" is the word that the hon. Gentleman is looking for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, incorrigible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an area such as Warwickshire, the LEA has to operate with choice and diversity. Choice and diversity are not a prescription for bad experiments to continue. The hon. Gentleman would accept that point, even if he would debate whether selective education is a bad experiment. There is no argument—in logic or in the educational interests of the country—that we should maintain schools and a system that fail. The selective system has failed many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the present LEAs, the structure allows flexibility and diversity. Unlike the urban area where I live, the counties of England such as Lancashire or Norfolk have great geographical separation, with different communities. I know the county of Lancashire better than I know the county of Warwickshire. Towns such as Burnley and those represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) in north-east Lancashire are different from the areas in south Lancashire that border the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall). No rational authority would plan its structure, including the planning and provision of places—which is what the amendment is about—on a county-wide basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking to the chief education officer from the city of Manchester today. We spoke of the way in which the Bill will affect Manchester as an education authority. He said that it is impossible—even in what is a relatively compact urban area—to plan school places on the basis of a whole city. That would be bad planning. There are financial consequences and issues that must be decided as
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
a matter of policy at that strategic level. That supports the argument to maintain the LEA as the funding authority. Decentralisation needs to take account of special differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The centre of Manchester is relatively poor; it is ethnically mixed and it has suffered considerably during the Government's years in office. Unemployment is high, which has direct consequences for young people's performance in schools. That brings us back to the debate about publishing incorrect information, as the Government did recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In outlying areas of Manchester, such as Didsbury, but still within the city, the structure changes dramatically. Unemployment is relatively low, even though it is a Labour seat: no Conservative has represented any part of the city of Manchester for the past six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If two schools in the relatively more affluent parts of Manchester—for example, Parrswood school in the southern part, or Oakwood in Chorlton—choose to opt out, it would trigger the 10 per cent. necessary to bring in the funding authority for the whole of the city. It is an outrageous principle that my constituents, for example, should find themselves operating under the aegis of the funding authority which has a clearly defined city-wide planning remit, when the location of the schools served by the authority was a tight, small geographical part of the LEA's area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises another interesting point on the amendment. I chose earlier to refer to my own county, and I spoke of the way in which the county council had devolved to districts for planning purposes within the authority. My hon. Friend, in the context of Manchester, has raised a point about the difference between constituencies. Has he thought about which part of an LEA area it might be? Might it be a district within the local authority organisation, or a constituency within the local authority area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the purpose of the amendment is to give the Secretary of State discretion, because we felt that that was the necessary price that we must pay. My hon. Friend is aware that the Bill is a centralising one which gives great power to one person—the Secretary of State. We accept that the Secretary of State for Education arrogates unto himself considerable power with an arrogance that would surprise many. Nevertheless, the amendment would give that control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there are social divisions and clear social differences within an LEA, it would make sense for the Secretary of State to recognise them and to plan accordingly. I was about to speak of counties such as Warwickshire. I do not wish to appear preoccupied with the county, but I find it interesting. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has played a significant role in stimulating debate, so it seems only right to give him the opportunity to play a further part by talking about his own LEA, if only because he will have to justify to his electors why he wants to screw up the business of the LEA which services their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We could talk about Derbyshire. I know it reasonably well. I live not far from its northern part. In the south, the community is different, with different structures. The idea that there is an argument for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
any authority—the funding authority or the LEA—planning only at county or authority level is ludicrous. If that point applies to a relatively confined urban area such as Manchester, how much more does it apply in rural counties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester City is a Labour-controlled authority. For the record, it has received praise from outside, not from Ministers—although, if the Minister were fair, he would confirm what I am about to say—but from the National Audit Office, which has lauded the way that Manchester tackled the problem of surplus places in city schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister recently met a delegation from Manchester who came to talk to him specifically about surplus places. I do not expect him to comment on the Government's decisions for the future. However, it is fair to say that members of Manchester authority felt that on that occasion they had been given a sympathetic hearing which showed understanding of what they were trying to achieve. They seek the removal of surplus places which will cost their authority money and divert resources from other parts of the education system. Manchester is intent upon tackling the problems that lie behind the clause. At present, for the most part, planning for school places is often a case of making sense of how to get rid of surplus places within an LEA's ambit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester has tried to take actions of which the Government approve. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that. Although it is a Labour authority, for some time it has been determined to perform a role that made economic sense in running school services. I quote Manchester not because it is one of my local authorities, although I know it well, but because it can hold its head high because of the way it has started to tackle those issues. I could have quoted the position in Wandsworth for similar reasons. The hon. Member for Battersea will realize that, because I am almost a part-time constituent of his—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part-time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My heart is not completely in it. As I spend my time in two constituencies, and I am well represented in my own constituency—by myself—I have not felt the need to be represented, except on one occasion. I shall not embarrass the hon. Member for Battersea by telling the Committee how he failed on that issue. We shall talk about that another time. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is much more assiduous for his other constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wandsworth, there is considerable variation between the parts that are represented by the hon. Member for Battersea and those that are represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Cox). The area in which I spend some of my time has gone through the process of urban gentrification and it differs a little from parts of Tooting which have not gone through such a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned four or five LEAs in England and one very important one in Wales. I could mention many others. The important point behind the amendment, which I hope the Minister will consider sensitively after trying to appreciate its importance, is that it is permissive. It does not require the Secretary of State to act; it merely provides him with an option—to provide a structure whereby the funding authority takes control of only part of the geographical area of a local authority where schools have already opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
I hope that the Minister will accept that, when talking seriously about local knowledge and a flexible structure that can begin to meet the needs of given geographical areas, it is wrong for a funding authority whose primary interest is located in a different area to be able to meddle in and decide matters in other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments, and I accept that they apply to any authority area, but I am not sure whether he has thought through the implications of his arguments. If the funding agency were to cover only part of an area, would it not be difficult to define that area and satisfy everyone who lives on either side of the boundary that the right boundary and been chosen? The local authority boundary is already defined. I put that point in all seriousness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point in all seriousness, but the hon. Gentleman's concern is unnecessary. There is now legal freedom for parents to send their children to schools in or outside their local authority area, so the local authority boundary has already ceased to have great significance. The schools form the unit that defines the authority; an LEA has a collection of schools. The local authority is geographically defined for the provision of other services, not necessarily education. That may make sense in some urban authorities, but not necessarily in authorities where there are vast differences between one end and the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that we should break up Trafford, for example, but there is no need to delineate a geographical area. We no longer have neighbourhood schools—parental choice would make that impossible now, and I think that local authorities are prevented from having such schools. In my constituency, a school established two or three years ago has proved to be successful and very popular. Parents come to me in anguish because they live within hundreds of yards of that school but are told that their children cannot attend because it is full and they applied late. That is a difficult problem. My sympathy is with parents who cannot understand why their children are forced to travel long distances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important point with regard to parental preference, as we now have to call it. The legal judgment—referred to as the Greenwich judgment—allows parents to cross local authority boundaries. It has caused difficulties because it prevents individual schools from adopting an admissions policy that discriminates in favour of local residents. The amendment deals with being part of an LEA. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if the Government were to make clear their view on the Greenwich judgment? Representations have been made by cross-party sources for the Government to consider the practical implications of that legal judgment. To date, they have taken a few steps back and have not clarified the position. We should urge the Government to consider those implications. Conservative LEAs in London have made representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have made brief representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dropping the hint that interventions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has got the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's brief intervention was important, although it puts me in a slightly difficult position. I have already told the Committee that my children cross into a different local authority to go to school. However, I can justify that as they do not do so at the expense of the children resident in that LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right in saying that there are difficulties which afflict all local education authorities as a result of the present law. The planning described in clause 7 would be much more difficult if a school is to be prevented from operating a policy that is in the interests of the people in its catchment area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to return to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, school travel patterns show that people do not travel far beyond their neighbourhoods. They do not want their children to travel much more than a couple of miles. That happens in rural areas, where childen travel considerably further. However, people normally exercise choice based on the geographical location of a school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that issue, the difficulty would arise only in a county area which has not already defined a district structure for its plan. My own county has a well-defined district structure which could easily be used for the purpose of the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Norwich, North will tell us more about the structure in Norfolk, but I foresee a difficulty only when the district structure is not in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, in the final analysis, the peripatetic Minister has said that there will be little difficulty with the role of the funding authority. I am not worried that the Minister is not in his place, as other Conservative Members are listening to the debate. I suspect that one or two of them are reconsidering their attitude to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister insists that the funding authority and the LEA will be able to co-operate. We are talking about opted-out schools in a specific geographical area: we are not asking that some opted-out schools be excluded from the funding authority in that area. But where a funding authority is confined to a reasonably well-defined part of an area, we want the Secretary of State to have the power to consider carving out that area as a unique entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that we propose a permissive rather than a mandatory measure. Ironically, it would be up to the Secretary of State to make up his or her mind about the way in which to use the measure.

I hope that I have done enough—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not sure what Conservative Back-Bench Members are saying. I might have to backtrack to ensure that they have understood me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Minister has resumed interest in the debate, I hope that he will tackle the fundamental issues. The provision proposed in amendment No. 138 would be permissive; it would not require the Secretary of State to do anything. It would simply give him an opportunity to operate in the proposed way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I stop my hon. Friend? After doing such a good job, he might persuade Conservative

Members not to accept the amendment. By emphasising that the amendment would not give the Secretary of State much power, he might discourage Conservative Members from supporting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reassure my hon. Friend. The amendment would give the Secretary of State power. That should present no difficulties for the Gauleiters—I mean Conservative Members. The amendment would grant the Secretary of State maximum discretionary freedom. However, the Secretary of State would not have to use the power set out in the amendment. The amendment would allow the flexibility that the Minister insists is part of his and his team's mental makeup. That flexibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stress that we remain implacably opposed to the concept of the funding agency, which is undemocratic and bureaucratic. However, we must accept that we lost the election and that we do not have a majority in Committee or in the House of Commons. We are forced, reluctantly, to accept that the funding agency will be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is intended to be constructive. It will add an extra power to the 44 powers that the Bill grants the Secretary of State for Education. I am sure that the Secretary of State will exercise his 45th power wisely under the Minister's guidance.

My constituency is covered by Lancashire LEA. It is not the largest LEA in the country—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the worst.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is the worst. That is not true. It is an excellent LEA. I worked for it for five or six years. My wife continues to work day and night as a psychologist for Lancashire LEA. Such is my confidence in the LEA that two of my three children attend Lancashire schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lancashire LEA is large. There are 200,000 school children within its boundaries. Some people would claim that it is far too large to be a local education authority. The boundary commissioners avidly read the record of our proceedings. When they read the record of tonight's proceedings, they should bear in mind that my district council, Hyndburn, hopes that, in the impending review, it will be chosen to be a unitary authority, and thus become a local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is unlikely that an authority of the size and diversity of Lancashire will be broken up into 14 district councils. A more likely scenario is that Lancashire will be left as it is, which is an unhappy amalgam within its current boundaries, or it may—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unhappy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman echos "unhappy", and indeed I am unhappy. The map of Lancashire before 1974 shows that our boundaries have been severely curtailed. The Boundary Commission may leave Lancashire alone as an enormous LEA, or break it up into a small number of fairly large LEAs. In either case, it is possible that all the opted-out schools in the LEA might be geographically concentrated. If they were all centred in Blackburn, for example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely unlikely that any schools in the constituency of my hon. Friend the former shadow Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), will opt out, but, if one accepts the hypothesis that they all opted out, which none has done yet, that would exceed the 10 per cent. trigger and introduce phase 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, who is not in his place, referred to the situation in his county, Mid Glamorgan, where the LEA is split up into diverse and semi-autonomous districts. The situation is the same in Lancashire, where 12 education districts are responsible for administering the education service in the county. The diversity among different parts of an authority—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth should know that it is bad-mannered to speak loudly when another hon. Gentleman is making a contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise unreservedly, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a county such as Lancashire, there is cultural and economic diversity. One need only imagine the differences between mill towns such as Blackburn and Burnley. There is intense rivalry between football teams, and many people in Blackburn have probably never even been to Burnley—who could blame them? Ribble valley, just to the north of my constituency, is largely rural. The LEA has been trying valiantly to reduce surplus places in parts of Ribble valley and it has been endlessly thwarted by representatives of the Conservative party who have a vested interest in keeping their schools open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman was on Blackburn council, can he tell us whether the hon. Member for Blackburn consulted him before coming out in favour of grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn is not in favour of grant-maintained schools and has long been on record for his opposition to them, both in his former position as the shadow Secretary of State for Education and now. There are no grant-maintained schools in Blackburn. The one school that is considering balloting has been strongly advised against seeking grant-maintained status, not only by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn but, as it is a Church of England school, by the Bishop of Blackburn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment provides that an order
	<br><blockquote><p>"may relate to the whole of a local education authority area or part thereof."</p></blockquote>
I have drawn the attention of the hon. Gentleman to that point because it was mentioned in a press release, which is of acute relevance to the amendment, put out by the hon. Member for Blackburn on 10 June 1992. The heading, with which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be familiar, is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Labour publishes new advice on opting-out."</p></blockquote>
The press release states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it must be recognised that local circumstances"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will vary. The community of schools is under threat of being broken up, but parents and governors may feel bound to make decisions about what they think is best for their school. Labour must not appear to be placed in a hostile position of opposition to such parents."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
That is a clear statement in favour of grant-maintained schools, made by the hon. Member for Blackburn. I am reminded that the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) was on the Blackburn local authority when the hon. Member for Blackburn was considering making that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect on both points. My constituency is the neighbouring one of Hyndburn, in which no schools have opted out or have balloted to do so. In Lancashire, opting out has been a fiasco for the Government. In one of the largest local education authorities in the country, the "incredible" success for the Government is 0·8 per cent. of schools being grant-maintained. Six schools, out of a total of 747 in the county, have opted out. That is hardly a success story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue my point about the problem of a geographical cluster of schools going for grant-maintained status. Blackburn is one example. A more interesting one—as I referred to the unhappy boundaries of Lancashire—is in the east of the county. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East is not here as she has a family interest in the example. In the constituency of Pendle, in the east of the county, part of a borough and part of that constituency were in Yorkshire until 1974. It is unlikely event of the schools around Barnoldswick going for grant-maintained status, that would take Lancashire county above the 10 per cent. threshold to introduce phase 2. Such an outcome would have occurred through expatriate Yorkshiremen trying to wreck Lancashire's education—a farcical situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will lead to the LEA sharing its function of providing sufficient school places with a funding agency representing schools in a tiny part of the LEA. We tried to get clarification from the Minister earlier in the week. He spoke of LEAs and the funding authorities "sharing", having "parallel functions", "working in partnership" and having a "joint role" in a co-opeative regime. It is not clear how that would operate in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fairly even split between GM schools and LEA schools in number and geographical spread would be bad enough. One can imagine the bureaucratic problems that that would result if the 10 per cent. threshold had been reached in one tiny part of an authority like Lancashire. It would cause chaos for the county's attempt to plan the number of places it will need in the future. One can imagine, in a county the size of Lancashire, the difficulty of planning future places in Lancaster, Morecambe or the Fylde coast, which have growing school numbers, in conjunction with a funding authority that has schools 30 or 40 miles away in areas that have no relevance to the west of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would like phase 2—the shared responsibility between the funding agency and the LEA—to be a temporary stage before phase 3, but that will not necessarily happen. If Lancashire ever gets to phase 2 after hitting the 10 per cent. trigger, I suspect that it will remain there in a semi-permanent state. In the primary sector, 450 schools would have to opt out for Lancashire to reach phase 3. At present, only one has opted out. It will take a long time to reach the 75 per cent. threshold, in that sector. In the secondary sector, 79 schools would have to be approved for grant-maintained status. The current total is five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
All the disadvantages of shared responsibility will soon become all too apparent. The opting out of a tiny number of schools, perhaps on the periphery of an LEA, would introduce an unwanted level of unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy. It would be ridiculous to bring that about. I know that the Minister is a reasonable man—he has shown that time and again, including earlier this evening when he accepted the spirit of amendment No. 105—so I hope that he will take account of the constructive spirit behind the amendment, which would give one extra power to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait and see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried about speaking in favour of the amendment because it would give the Secretary of State an additional power. He may choose not to exercise that power, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford said, it would enable the Secretary of State to determine that the order is applicable only to part of an LEA area rather than to all of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will regret missing this debate. His previous occupation was as a geography lecturer and we have had a Cook's tour of England and Wales this evening. He would have found interesting the way that we have considered the diverse nature of the counties of England and, to a lesser extent Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A party that proclaims itself to be in favour of choice and diversity would welcome the amendment. It provides that within an LEA area, part of education provision would be subject to the funding agency and another part to the LEA. That would offer real choice and diversity. At the moment, if the trigger of 10 per cent. is reached, and the Secretary of State makes an order under the clause, the funding agency will automatically begin to carry out its duties of the shared and parallel responsibilities that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment should be supported for practical reasons, but I shall try to avoid discussing those that have already been mentioned. One of the most important is that some of the LEAs are smaller than some of the larger towns in a county council area. For example, in LEA areas of the old Inner London education authority, such as Camden, Westminster, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, the school population is probably smaller than that of a large city or town such as Norwich. I cannot remember the precise population of Norwich, but I think that it is approximately 200,000, which would mean that its school population would be higher than that of a borough such as Camden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would permit Norwich to have a funding agency only if the Secretary of State thought it appropriate. The amendment recognises the diversity of LEAs in England and Wales and the fact that some LEAs are extremely large. I believe that Strathclyde is the largest LEA this side of Moscow. The school populations of Essex, Kent and Lancashire are larger than the populations of several small LEAs, a factor that would be recognised under the provisions of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towns and cities, such as Norwich, Bristol, Southampton and Derby, could be treated differently from other county council areas. I understand that there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
support in the Conservative party for making areas such as Derby independent of their county council by granting them unitary status. That has operated in unitary authorities such as those in metropolitan boroughs, which have combined provision of education with housing, social services, libraries and arts. In those boroughs, we can see the merits of unitary authorities rather than the duplication that exists in shire districts and shire county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is support across the party divide for unitary authorities, which are a positive way forward. Indeed, the amendment reflects that. It recognises that, in many unitary authorities, schools have been the vehicle for bringing together different services. Longbenton community college in my constituency has a school population of 11 to 18-year-olds, but, in addition, it provides social service facilities for the mentally ill and handicapped. It has library and sports facilities on site and it caters for adults returning to education. It is a good example of how a school operating in a unitary authority can promote all those services. If schools began to opt out in one part of my constituency, I could see the merit in treating that area differently from other areas in which schools had not opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must acknowledge that, in many LEAs, especially the shire counties, there is a split between rural and urban areas. A map makes it possible to break a county down into clearly identifiable areas. The hon. Member for Norwich, North raised the problem of how to create proper boundaries that people will understand. There is a simple answer to that problem. The boundary should follow the pyramid of any school system. Once the Bill becomes law and schools start to opt out, not only high schools but feeder primary schools will opt out. That is why provision is included in the Bill for primary schools to opt out in clusters. It would then be possible to identify clearly groups in a LEA—the high school and its feeder primary schools—that have achieved grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it would be sensible if the Secretary of State did not insist that the whole LEA should be subject to the funding agency. The Secretary of State should have discretion to confer the responsibility in respect of part of the area. In some local education authority areas there may be pockets of grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example is West Sussex, where there are no grant-maintained schools. If all secondary schools in Chichester, for example, were to achieve grant-maintained status, it would be appropriate to apply an order under clause 7 to Chichester but not to an expanding town such as Crawley. Crawley is also in West Sussex but the needs of its community may be different and if it were necessary to plan new schools because of an expanding school population, a dual and shared responsibility might not be helpful. The amendment would provide the necessary flexibility. It would recognise that no centralised solution exists for all the problems that local education authorities may face if many schools in their areas achieve grant-maintained status. The amendment would provide the Secretary of State with freedom and discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are unhappy about that. The Secretary of State already has 44 powers, if not 45—additional powers may have been given to him as we have gone through the Bill. I understand that the spirit of an amendment was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
accepted during my absence, and perhaps my Whip will allow me to be away more often if that is the effect of my absence from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a serious one, the purpose of which is to deal with the practical difficulties that will occur in some larger counties. Many of those counties are Conservative controlled and I am sure that the amendment would have the support of Conservatives in local government. We shall be interested to know whether it has the support of Conservative Members in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, before the Committee adjourns, the Minister will tell us how many schools have achieved grant-maintained status. Since the Committe has been sitting, the total has risen by only two and it would be interesting to know what the latest total is. That information is important to our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is reasonable and practical. Its purpose is to solve some of the problems that will be created by the Bill and it should command the Committee's support. We hope that the Minister will recognise the power of some of our arguments and that he will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier we heard from the hon. Member for City of Durham about the fruits of his research assistant's labours. My researchers have also been busy, and they say that the amendment would be a recipe for utter chaos. At any time in an LEA, the funding authority alone could be responsible for providing school places in one area, the LEA alone could be responsible for that in another area, and both the LEA and the funding authority could be responsible in yet another area. That could apply to the primary sector, the secondary sector, or both. It would be difficult for either the LEA or the funding authority to play provision effectively in such circumstances. I rest my case and ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to make. First, it is unfair of the Minister to blame his civil servants for the bad advice that he has given to the Committee. If he wants seriously to debate the issue—despite his contemptuous response, it is a serious issue—he should stand up and take responsibility. His response was cavalier because the issue is not tribial. Part of the confusion inherent in the Bill is caused by the fact that there will be no clear boundary between the funding authority and the LEAs. I agree with the Minister's advice from civil servants: the Bill is bound to confuse. I congratulate them on wriggling free from the ideological changes imposed by the Government, coming clean and dropping the Minister into the middle of the problems that the clause will create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to improve a most unsatisfactory clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said that small parts of some LEAs are bigger than the entire LEA in other areas. In Greater Manchester, for example, the existing LEA of Bury has two parliamentary constituencies. That compares with north-east Lancashire, where my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn has his constituency. The cosntituencies of Blackburn, Hyndburn and Pendle could be in the remit of the same funding authority. That funding authority would have an area bigger than the Bury local authority. That might sound confused, but the Bill will create even more confusion. The arrogance of the Minister's response is breathtaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hour is late and we want to make progress. Therefore, I shall not pursue the matter. I warn the
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
Minister that his comments were helpful, but not helpful to him and I am delighted to put that on the record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 137, page 3, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) (a) The Secretary of State must give three months' notice of his intention to make an order made under subsection (1) above; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) such an order may only commence at the start of the financial year.'.</p></blockquote>
I said in the previous debate that I hoped that the common sense of the amendment would appeal to the Minister's better instincts. We failed to provoke an enlightened response and I doubt that I shall do any better this time. The difficulty with the funding authority system is that the authority will have powers over a considerable slice of educational life within a given LEA area. However, there is no mechanism in the Bill that specifies the time scale during which the funding authority will come into operation. There is no reference to a period of notice that the Secretary of State must give to the local education authority to allow the LEA to plan how to phase in its activities with those of the funding authority. There is no mechanism to give the funding authority time 10 establish its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time that elapses between a successful ballot to opt out and the coming into force of the grant-maintained structure varies. In some cases the structure is in operation very quickly, in others there have been long delays. There is a strong suspicion that the timing is rigged for the Government's political purposes. When they wanted a spectacular propaganda success they made every haste to bring in the new grant-maintained structure, but when it suited them to take things a little more slowly, the matter was delayed. The charge is, effectively, that the Secretary of State, unrestrained by anything in the Bill to give him strict rules by which to conduct his operations, will tend to use the system to his policial advantage. I think that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would regard that as unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure an orderly planning structure for the newly-created financial authorities. In particular, it would bring the planning authorities into operation at a time of year appropriate to the planning cycle by which the existing planning authorities already operate. There are three different starting points for any year. We could have gone for the calendar year or the school year, but the one that makes most sense for an authority with a planning function is a year that starts and ends with the local authority year. That begins, effectively with the financial year, because central Government plans around that and so local authorities are driven to plan around it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was discussing with the chief education officer in Manchester the implications of bringing an authority into operation at a different time of year. He said that he was worried—professionally, not in any political sense—about the possibility that were the funding authority to emerge mid-way through the year, planning would be virtually impossible for any local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not intended greatly to tie the Secretary of State's hands, but it would limit his activities. It would prevent his using the funding authority to boost
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
his party politically, but the Committee should accept that it is not unreasonable for us to want to tie the Secretary of State's hands in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the great problems with a fairly radical Bill such as this is that it introduces uncertainty into the education system, at least for the first few years while it beds down? Is not the amendment intended to provide some certainty so that local authorities can plan properly, knowing the Secretary of State's intentions? At the moment they may be left very vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Manchester's chief education officer expressed just those fears to me. What would happen when the funding authority began operating is uncertain. There is a need for the funding authority and the local education authorities to know where they stand in relation to each other. Because the local authority planning cycle is based around a starting point related to the financial year and local elections, it would make most sense for the new funding authority to come into operation at a time that would allow it to use the same financial year as the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the amendment would require the Secretary of State to give three months' notice of his intention to make an order under clause 7(1) to bring the funding authority into being. The three-month notice period achieves two things. It gives time to establish the funding authority, allowing it to begin appointing staff and establishing structure. It also gives the local authority three months to recognise that the funding authority will be a co-planner—a parallel planning authority. In addition, at the start of the new financial year, both funding authority and LEA will have had the opportunity to get together to begin, at least, to establish some lines of communication. None of us know on what basis funding authorities and local authorities will operate with each other. We have discussed the confusion inherent in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want funding authorities to be rushed in on the whim of the Secretary of State. If they must exist, we want an orderly introduction. Nothing in the Bill allows for an orderly approach. The Minister will tell us that the Secretary of State is a man of the highest probity and that he would do nothing to allow confusion to reign, but the clause is confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable for there to be a planning structure for the funding authority-to-be and the local education authority to use. The amendment would put flesh on the structure. I ask the Minister to take the amendment seriously and not be as dismissive of it as he was of amendment No. 138.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford, the Committee must recognise that the Bill will fundamentally change the delivery of education. That is the Government's intention. There will be radical change and a new array of relationships between LEAs and the funding agency. Opposition Members at least are concerned that in the period of change there will be much destruction which will
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
affect the quality of education. Disruption does not help to raise standards. There will be uncertainty about the effects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would introduce clarity and remove vagueness by making the Secretary of State give the LEAs three months' notice of his intention to make an order under the clause. Such an order would commence at the start of the financial year. The certainty that the amendment would provide is important. Currently, there is no qualification of the way the Secretary of State can use the authority that the clause would provide to make an order. The amendment would constrain his power. We do not apologise for that. The Secretary of State will have 44 new powers should the Bill go on the statute book unamended. We want to lay down how his powers under the clause would operate and ensure as little disruption as possible to the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three options for when an order made under the clause should start: the beginning of the calendar year, of the financial year of the school year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for the calendar year are limited and thin. That has little merit because it would cut across the school year and disrupt the necessary financial year planning by schools and local education authorities. The argument is thus between the order starting at the beginning of the school year or of the financial year. There are arguments in favour of the school year, such as that it would minimise the disruption to schools. It makes sense to start at the beginning of the financial year because schools, local education authorities and funding authorities will need to plan their revenue and, in particular, capital spending. The latter often requires a lengthy period in which to develop initiatives and make submissions to the Department of the Environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has spoken of the difference between the school and the financial year. He will be more aware than I that the argument for the school year would hold good if grant-maintained schools were created only at the beginning of the school year. One of the real difficulties is that the Government have chosen to have no pattern for the creation of grant-maintained schools other than the political whim of the Secretary of State. Grant-maintained schools come into existence throughout the year. The amendment concerns the funding authority as planning authority, not as academic government. The arguments for the financial year on which my hon. Friend touched are profound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are useful points. I understand that when the DFE was approving applications for grant-maintained status, one or two applications to start in April were deferred until September. There was then a view that the Department was trying to achieve a common start date for grant-maintained schools. There have, however, been several subsequent approvals that do not bear out that view. My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford is right to say that there is no consistency on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no guarantee that grant-maintained schools will want to follow the traditional school-year pattern. Some city technology colleges have adopted a four-term year and some grant-maintained schools may be considering, in consultation with parents, whether to move to a four or five-term year. I have always favoured a four-term year for education. If grant-maintained schools

	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
are actively considering a four or five-term year, that would be a strong argument against a start date at what has traditionally been the beginning of the school year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that different timetables for schools in the same area would present difficulties for parents? If one school has a three-term year, another a four-term year and another a five-term year, it would be extremely difficult for parents to plan trips away during school holidays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to fall into the trap of saying that the schoool year should be determined according to when parents want to take their holidays. In discussions that I had before I entered the House, we tried to promote the educational benefits of a four-term year. One problem was that peple were concerned about losing their long summer holidays. That is regrettable, but I understand that it is a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the discussions that have taken place in schools that are considering changing their traditional school year to one of four or five terms. Parents, the local community and employers are being consulted to ensure that the holiday period fits in with the work patterns in particular industries. Certain parts of the country, such as Lancashire, still have wakes weeks, which means that school holidays must coincide with the factories closing down for a week, 10 days or even two weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong argument that a clause 7 order at the beginning of a school year will not be helpful. Perhaps the beginning of the financial year is the more appropriate and beneficial time for the Secretary of State to make a clause 7 order. The amendment seeks to bring that about. In terms of revenue and capital spending a degree of planning is essential. The beginning of the financial year has the advantage of fitting in well with the beginning of a school year. If the school year begins in September and the clause 7 order starts at the beginning of the financial year in April, there are several months to plan before the school year begins, thereby reducing the disruption that may be caused to children. That is the philosophy behind the
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
amendment. The Opposition are keen to ensure that, whatever happens to the Bill, there is minimum disruption to our children. There is bound to be some disruption because of the vagueness and uncertainty in the Bill, as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must give notice of his intention to make a clause 7 order. As the Bill stands, there is no time limit or constraint on the way in which the Secretary of State makes such an order. The LEA, which has the legal responsibility at present under the Education Act 1944, must be informed by the Secretary of State that he intends to make an order under clause 7. We think that three months is appropriate, although perhaps more time should be allowed. I think that three months is a very short time in which to plan the education provision and six months might have received more support, but on balance, we think that three months is appropriate. It recognises that, no doubt, the Secretary of State will want to get on with setting up the funding agency. It would allow the LEA to recognise the new relationship that will exist between the LEA and the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LEA and the funding agency may have a shared or parallel responsibility. The Minister said that he hopes that it will exercised in a spirit of co-operation. He said he hoped that there would not be a dog-in-the-manger attitude by the LEAs, but that they would respond positively to the changed circumstances and would co-operate with the funding agency. It is difficult to imagine such co-operation as it is imposed by the Secretary of State, with little notice given to the LEA. For those reasons, it is important that we reflect on the significance of amendment No. 137 and allow the Minister to consider our reasonable proposals. There should be a requirement for three months' notice, which should begin at the start of the financial year. We hope that the amendment has the Minister's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
