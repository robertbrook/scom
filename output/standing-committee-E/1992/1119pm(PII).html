<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
<p><b>[Continuation from col. 96]</b></p>
<p>8.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am told that the acoustics are not good, so I shall raise my voice. One of my hon. Friends asked whether I could begin my remarks again. My hon. Friend will read reports of the debate attentively when <i>Hansard</i> is printed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned reading <i>Hansard</i> carefully. Will he reflect on the care that will now be required to read remarks by the junior Minister, given the newly elevated position of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth?<br><br>
It will not have escaped the notice of members of the Committee that when the Secretary of State could not be found, and so did not appear on Channel 4 News at 7 o'clock, it was not the junior Minister who stood in as the Secretary of State's spokesman but the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The television appearances of the hon. Gentleman have nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never said a word, nor did the junior Minister. We look forward to hearing the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth respond to the debate later.<br><br>
When we adjourned, we were debating the important group of amendments that touch on membership of the funding agency. I had started talking about the type of people who ought to be members. I remarked on the provisions in the Bill through which the Secretary of State makes an explicit requirement for people with a background in primary or secondary education and for those with "industrial, commercial or financial" experience, or
<br><blockquote><p>"the practice of any profession."</p></blockquote>
I was developing the theme that the amendments will widen the scope of the committee and increase its members to allow for a greater range of experience.<br><br>
I mentioned briefly that the amendment would allow to continue the involvement of people from primary and secondary education. I mentioned the need for special education and was preparing to comment on that further education sector. I pointed out the amendments Nos. 22 and 23 would have the effect of requiring the Secretary of State to appoint persons from that background.<br><br>
There is now a plethora of bodies involved in post-16 education. There is the Further Education Funding Council, the schools funding agency, which will have these responsibilities, the LEAs and the technical education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
colleges. A fifth body is also involved in post-16 education: the regional advisory committees that were set in under the Education Act 1944 but are little known outside the south-east because they operate only in that region. I do not know the history behind that, but if the Minister has time, perhaps he will tell the Committee why that is so. It is a historic fact that has applied under Governments of both persuasions. In my region, the north-west, the opportunity to have the services of regional advisory committees was perhaps never offered.<br><br>
The advisory committee in the south-east glories in the unusual title LASERACET—the London and south-east region advisory committee for education and training. While this body has no statutory power, it has an important role because it was set up specifically to be the co-ordinating body for precisely the type of post-16 education to which I referred.<br><br>
LASERACET was recognised as far ago as 1944; its principles were certainly applied in the south-east although not in all parts of the country. The need for co-ordination was recognised even when there were only a limited number of bodies with responsibility for further education. In those days, there were no such things as the Further Education Funding Council, the funding agency or the TECs. However, because local authorities needed some co-ordination to plan for the post-16 sector, a planning mechanism was vital to ensure that there was a framework within which decisions could be taken. <i>[Interruption].</i> I am finding it extremely difficult to hear myself speak, Sir John.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a lot of hubbub in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Sir John. I do not think I<br><br>
am very good after dinner—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I am wonderful. That is kind.<br><br>
LASERACET provides a planning framework for co-ordination. It is important to remember that there will be the same type of decision-making body in the future. There was a need, post-1944, for a co-ordinating structure—how much it was needed depended on the part of the country involved. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education will accept that we must get the planning framework right and ensure that there are places in institutions such as schools and colleges of further education. It is important, too, to consider the provision of industrial and vocationally based training opportunities. The structure of co-ordination is important to such provisions. The funding agency for schools, will have direct responsibility for planning for sixth-form colleges and centres and will, of course, co-ordinate plans with the existing local authorities, where they retain responsibilities. The co-ordinating function is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that some students in sixth forms are resitting their A-levels? They are over 18, in non-advanced education. That might create problems when the funding agency for schools is set up because those pupils will not be covered by the statutory provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, which I had not considered. It amplifies my argument that there is a need for a proper co-ordinating mechanism to consider cases in which people fall outside the remit of the responsible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
agency. There is a clear case for the further education sector to be represented on the funding agency, and it should be stated in the Bill. It would improve the way in which the funding agency operates.<br><br>
The amendments also cover people who have been providers of education. In a nutshell, that refers to the local authorities which, until now, have planned and funded education in England and Wales. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities is not a body that the Minister would embrace politically but it does speak for local government in the metropolitan areas. Some years ago, it was a Conservative-controlled body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister remembers those great days, when he was prepared to listen to the voice of local government. That was before he entered the House and learnt that under no circumstances should local government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may like to know that I played a modest part in local government in the dim and distant past. I had the honour to be a member of the Brentwood urban district council from 1968 to 1972. That shows my age and that I served in local government, with which I have much sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the residents of Brentwood still talk of the Minister's role in local government. I am not sure whether the old Brentwood council was an education authority, nor whether it is now, but local government has been central to the funding and provision of school education. Like the AMA, the Association of County Councils—which represents a significant number of Conservative-controlled county councils—also has worries about the Bill, and I know that there is contention among Conservative Members about the threat to lop off the heads of Conservative party workers in that sector of local government. The AMA said of the White Paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"The FAS for schools will have some powers now exercised by LEAs but without the discipline of local democratic accountability operated in public. The new powers of the FAS and the Secretary of State will be exercised under Parliamentary scrutiny; but the seat of power will be remote from individual parents, schools and communities. The opportunity for parents to seek redress from LEA officers and elected members will be lost".</p></blockquote>
The Minister has already told us about the importance of parental involvement. I hope that he accepts that, even if the Bill is intended to make the LEAs wither on the vine of history, they will remain as important as—or more to—the funding agency for a considerable time. The best possible relationship between the LEAs and the funding agency must be established in that period. The funding agency is already in operation in those few LEAs in which more than 10 per cent. of secondary schools have opted out. I cannot think of any LEA where the 75 per cent. level is imminently in danger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fairly certain that one authority, Hillingdon, has passed the 75 per cent. mark. Others are approaching it rapidly, but the numbers are still low.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that point. The amendment deals with membership of the funding agency. We are going wide of that subject—and at great length.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As to the length of my speech, Sir John, I know that some hon. Members are sufficiently at ease to be succinct. I have to elaborate on the point as I understand it before I can explain it properly to the Committee. I apologise for that.<br><br>
8.45 pm<br><br>
For a long time, local education authorities almost everywhere will be at least joint providers of education. In many places, it may be a long time before LEAs have to share responsibility with the funding agency. Therefore, the funding agency should have a close working relationship with local education authorities.<br><br>
The Minister said earlier that parents should be involved in decision making. The funding agency will be fundamental to the decision-making structure. Whatever an appointed individual's expertise, only LEAs can claim to have a democratic mandate or legitimacy. They represent the community as well as parents. Local education authorities should have a decision-making role. The Opposition have not made any secret that we should prefer a democratic mandate that was exercised locally to the centralising provisions of the Bill. However, we accept that some form of representative democracy, for example, Parliament, exists in Britain. The mandate of local education authorities will not be undermined if they are represented on the funding agency. LEAs should be one of the legs of the funding agency. If LEAs become obsolete, the Secretary of State could amend primary legislation, or the Minister could table an amendment to our amendment that would allow for such a change.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 challenge the Bill's structure. They would make the funding agency more representative of the necessary range and diversity of opinion that exists. I hope that the Minister will accept our arguments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 58 deals specifically with race relations and equal opportunities. It would require the Secretary of State to appoint to the funding agency people who have a background in those sectors. We should take note of a court case between the Equal Opportunities Commission and the city of Birmingham. The commission believed that the city of Birmingham was acting against the letter and spirit of the Sex Discrimination Act 1976 by maintaining single sex schools. The court ruled in favour of the Equal Opportunities Commission. I shall read the concluding comments from the case, which are relevant to our deliberations. The court ruled as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 8 does not impose a duty to provide secondary schools. The duty is to secure that sufficient schools shall be available in the area for providing secondary education. It followed therefore in discharging that 'securing function' the council has to have regard to the availability of educational opportunities provided by all the schools within its area, including relevant places in grant-maintained schools and even relevant places in independent schools.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The council could not ignore the existence and discriminatory effects of some 120 grammar school places being available at Handsworth grammar school for boys merely because the school has changed its status and become a grant-maintained school. Handsworth grammar school remained a part of the pool for public sector grammar school education within the council area."</p></blockquote>
The point is that, whichever the funding authority—the local education authority in that example—it will have to take account of that judgment in its responsibilities for the opening and closing of schools and the provision of school places in the future.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
In its concluding comments, the court made a direct reference to the matter before the Committee. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is noteworthy that in the important paper entitled 'Choice and Diversity: A New Framework for School', which was presented to Parliament by the Secretaries of State for Education and Wales in July 1992, no reference was made to the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act. This Act, and comparable legislation in the field of race relations, requires close examination when the duties and obligations of bodies responsible for the provision of public sector education are being formulated."</p></blockquote>
The court was absolutely clear that the Bill and the preceding White Paper missed an opportunity to take account of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976. I do not know the constitutional position on a court commenting on a White Paper—I suspect there is no difficulty with that. I am not even sure if there would be difficulty if the court commented on a Bill. I have never been aware that a court has commented on proposed legislation going through the House, although it is well within the competence of the court to make such helpful comments. After all, it has just ruled on a subject that predated the Bill but that ruling will certainly have major repercussions on the Bill. The Minister must comment on the ruling in his response tonight.<br><br>
Equal opportunities and good race relations are issues that every Committee member would hold as having great importance. You, Sir John, were a member of the race relations Sub-committee of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, so the issue in not academic for you. You have spent time helping to improve race relations. For those reasons, we think that it is important that some understanding of the needs of equal opportunities and race relations needs to be made explicit within the Bill.<br><br>
The amendments would change the structure of the funding agency, but at no point are we claiming that, simply by altering the structure, we would automatically dictate a framework within which the funding agency would operate. We could not do that anyway because, as I have already said, clause 6 states that the Secretary of State would ultimately have power to cast as nought any decision or any representation made by even the most forthright of the funding agency's members. If the Government want a normally independent funding agency, that funding agency should be comprised of people of the highest calibre, with the widest and most useful background experience. The amendments propose background experience that could only help not necessarily in the funding of schools, but for future planning.<br><br>
I am conscious that we have had to race through the Bill more quickly than we would have wished, but progress has to be made, so I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill works as the Government intend, the funding agency will take over the role of the democratically elected and locally accountable LEAs. The amendments are important because if we are to remove local government control and replace it with central Government control, we need to ensure that the people who serve on the funding agency for schools are up to the task. Amendment No. 23 sets out certain criteria according to which membership of funding agencies will be appointed.<br><br>
We should take great care when deciding how the funding agency should be constituted. The Government could win some friends—they need some friends for this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
Education Bill—without risking what they want to achieve. They should ensure that the people who serve on the funding agency are from the coalition of people interested in education. That is very important.<br><br>
It has been confirmed this evening that the funding agency for schools will be a bureaucratic organisation: in my parlance that is a quango. The Minister produced the guidelines on its financial probity. It will have to ensure sufficient provision for primary and secondary school education. Another important aspect of the funding agency's responsibility is to calculate and make payments of recurrence and capital grant for grant-maintained schools. We need to ensure that members of the funding agency have a broad base. The funding agency may be involved in Hillingdon if more than 75 per cent. of schools apply for grant-maintained status. The other 25 per cent. of schools may come under the direct control of the agency and their interests should be represented.<br><br>
The funding agency is charged with the closure, enlargement or significant change of character of the schools under its control. Those words could describe the introduction of grammar schools and a selective process. We should ensure that the interests of the local community are fully represented when such decisions are made. I would have more confidence—although not much more—if the amendment were accepted. A local input into a local education service is important.<br><br>
The funding agency will be centrally appointed and will probably be centrally located, but it will be involved in the delivery of local education services, even in remote areas. It should have some expertise in the delivery of local education services. The amendment deals specifically with that important point and requires the inclusion of people with experience of local education authorities, which have implemented the majority of the changes to the education system in the past 13 years. The Minister ought not to overlook that fact, although no doubt it has not been absent from his thinking. It is a powerful argument for ensuring that such representation will be part of the funding arrangements.<br><br>
9 pm<br><br>
It is essential that the funding agencies for schools include representatives who are education practitioners. Amendment No. 23 would allow for a place for practitioners of primary and secondary school education. It is important to consider their contribution to the delivery of education, especially during the past 13 years. They introduced the general certificate of secondary education examination, a move that I supported whole-heartedly. The amalgamation of the certificate of secondary education and the GCSE was an important change in education provision, but it was the teachers who enabled it to be implemented, against a difficult backdrop of changes in curriculum and syllabus, and in textbooks. Practitioners have expertise in dealing with changes in education and should be included in the funding arrangements.<br><br>
Schools now test children at age seven, and again at 11, 14 and 16. The education practitioners have practical experience of testing. In my view this entitles them to representation on the funding agency. There has also been the introduction of technical and vocational education initiative—TVEI—and of records of achievement. There
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
has been an improvement in special education for children with special educational needs. Those practitioners would be worthy appointees to the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
I have a great deal of interest in special education, having spent seven years before being elected to Parliament working with children with special educational needs, not all of whom had statements. The Education Act 1981 and the regulations of 1983 that accompanied it brought down some of the barriers to the integration of children with special needs into mainstream schools.<br><br>
The aim of the Bill—we shall come to the specifics later—is to increase integration. The way to do that—the fundamental point for the funding agency—is to provide more resources, and the funding agency will control schools resoures. More educational psychologists will be needed to enhance the statementing procedures. This is subject to further consideration so I shall say no more about it now. More money will also be required for revenue and capital grants for mainstream schools to allow children with special needs to be integrated. Therefore, it is important for people who represent children with special needs to be members of the funding agency. They should be there when decisions are made and discussion takes places.<br><br>
Such people are a potentially powerful body in education. The Warnock report states that there may be 2 per cent. of pupils with statements, but there could also be 18 per cent. of other children with specific special educational needs. That 20 per cent. is a wider percentage of the school population. For that reason, they are entitled to be represented in the funding agency arrangements.<br><br>
I have a document from the Special Educational Consortium, which expresses concern about the disbanding of the LEAs and about the fundamental importance of the body that takes their place. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The diminishing role of the LEA with devolved management and budgets presents a direct threat to the provision of a coherent range of services for children with special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
One way of overcoming that organisation's concern would be for the Minister to accept that representatives of those with special needs should have a direct input to the funding agency. The consortium's document continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no requirement for there to be any member of the Funding Agency with any experience or understanding of special educational needs (Clause 1)."</p></blockquote>
—which is what we are discussing, it continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential for the FA to include members with expertise in SEN if it is to be able to make informed decisions in the best interests of all children."</p></blockquote>
That is a powerful case for the Minister to accept our amendment.<br><br>
I am worried that special needs could be marginalised under the Bill. I am greatly concerned that they may be under-funded and that 18 per cent. of the children with special needs could be left unprovided for. Amendment No. 23 would go some way to allaying those fears.<br><br>
I make two other points. One criticism of the amendment may be that we have prescribed the number of persons or organisations to be represented in the funding agency. We mentioned primary and school experience, further education and special needs expertise, and suggested that LEAs be represented. The Minister may say that our amendment also excludes some categories, but it is not mutually exclusive. It mentions who should be included, and covers representatives of commerce and industry, which is important. If the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
guaranteed representatives of those groups a place in the organisation, they would win many friends and go some way to convincing the wider public that this is a good education measure.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will take note of my second point. The phrase "appears to him"—that is, the Secretary of State—is used in the Bill. Our amendments Nos. 13 and 24 proposes that the the phrase be removed because, in my opinion, it is extremely subjective. I seek your guidance here, Sir John. The phrase refers to the opinion of the Secretary of State. I doubt whether it is good legislative practice to build into law subjective assessments of people's ability. I would far rather the Bill be objective. Our amendment would remove the subjectivity, provide some objectivity, and improve the measure.<br><br>
We know that the funding agency for schools will be a quango. The Government's record on quangos is not good. Government appointees to quangos have reflected the interests of one political party. That cannot be allowed to happen in education because it will be bad for it. The amendments contain good proposals, which the Government could accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to reflect, in the context of that comment, on allegations about single party political appointees being chosen by some local education authorities. I hope that this is not a case of people in glasshouses throwing stones or pots calling kettles black.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's useful intervention—for the simple reason that two wrongs do not make a right. The Minister may laugh, but I condemn any organisation that tries to make representation on any body exclusive, from wherever that representation comes. Will the Minister join me in condemning that practice?<br><br>
The Minister is not prepared to condemn it because he is happy for the Government to pursue it while condemning local authorities for doing so. Two wrongs do not make a right. I believe in a pluralist democracy. There should be broad representation in all such organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has massive experience in local government. Does he agree that one of its great strengths—in Conservative-controlled as well as Labour-controlled authorities—is that it has recognised That service to the community is enhanced by allowing cross-party representation on this type of public body?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Any organisation that brings in a coalition of people to handle problems achieves better results. My authority, Warrington—I am still a member but no longer leader—tried to involve most opposition parties in most of the organisations over which we had some influence because we considered it valuable to take the whole town with us. Warrington and Runcorn development corporation is a Government-appointed quango. The Warrington community health care (NHS) trust has also been announced recently, and it is clear that the approach to the appointments to such bodies has not been pluralistic. The Minister should not condemn Labour authorities when he is responsible for that aberration. I am committed to democracy—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I trust that my remarks are still in order, Sir John. I am aware that I crossed your path a number of times this evening. I am trying my level best to stick to the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, the hon. Gentleman has been perfectly in order throughout his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. The funding agency for schools will cause the demise of LEAS. That is a terrible blow to democracy. The Minister could repair some of that damage by ensuring that the balance of membership of the funding agency for schools reflects the broad coalition in the world of education. If he accepts the amendment, he will receive my praise, but I have an awful, paradoxical feeling that the Government will not accept any Opposition amendments. However, I shall wait and see and hope that I will be proved wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to add a few words in support of the amendment and of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd).<br><br>
There is general agreement that high calibre people should serve on the funding agency. A person's previous experience before appointment to the funding agency will be crucial in determining his or her effectiveness as an agency member. The amendments would structure the experience of funding agency members so that they can make effective decisions. The funding authorities will be at a distinct disadvantage to the LEAs, which in many ways they will supplant. They will not be situated in the local communities. They will not be readily accessible to individuals, pressure groups, providers, suppliers or clients of the education service in a community. In effect, they will be sheltered from local opinion. The access that they give to the opinions of providers and users of the local education service makes LEAs accountable and enables them, for the most part, to make good decisions.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of the funding agency will be that it will not be locally based. I look forward to debating the agency's regional structure. The Minister has not yet made it clear whether the agency would have such a structure, nor how close to the grass roots the decision-making process will be. The disadvantage of not being situated in local communities is that there will be no chance to fine-tune decisions, which can be done only when local people's opinions are taken into account.<br><br>
Most importantly, the funding authorities will not be accountable. They will neither be appointed nor dismissed by the people whom they serve. The funding authorities will not, at the beginning of their existence, enjoy much respect from people in the education world or from education users. That much is clear from the responses that have been made to the White Paper and the Bill. If we are to have a funding agency—which I do not support—it must be structured in such a way as to confer as much legitimacy as possible. At present, people see the funding authorities as creatures of the Secretary of State. He will be able to guide them and to invite them to make certain comments. There has been a similar problem with the National Curriculum Council. People are suspicious of members of the NCC because they believe that that body is too much a creature of the Secretary of State. The Bill gives the Secretary of State considerable powers to appoint and dismiss members of the funding agency. The body to which the Bill will give birth is not highly regarded at its very conception by those who will be affected by its decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that the funding agency is not highly regarded. That is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
necessarily true. The hon. lady represents a Birmingham constituency. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh dear."] The Opposition are very sensitive about Birmingham. <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> recently included an article entitled, "Battlelines Drawn in Bolshy Brum". In the article, a head teacher said:
<br><blockquote><p>"When you are virtually bottom of every funding table, I don't think you can lose. If anything, it will be good for the Funding Agency to play devil's advocate".</p></blockquote>
That is an example of a head teacher who works in the local education system, who welcomes the funding agency because it will act as a spur to a lousy local education authority.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to say this, but the hon. Gentleman has wrung from me an admission that head teachers, even in Birmingham, can be wrong sometimes.<br><br>
I know, from the consultation responses that I read, that the funding agency is not generally welcomed, either as a replacement for local education authorities or in the form set out in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) would be more credible if he talked about the Birmingham school of which he is a governor, which has not asked to discuss opting out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot debate those matters now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the funding agency will be born with distinct disadvantages when compared with a local education authority. Changing membership would lend it more legitimacy, perhaps not for Conservative Members, but in the education world and in the communities where it will operate.<br><br>
The amendments propose representation that should be accepted by all parties. For example, we propose that someone who has experience of further education should be appointed to the funding agency. The links between secondary and further education are crucial. There is a terrible overlap of regulatory bodies for the 16- to 19-year-old group. We should ensure that the funding agency, which serves schools, has close links with the funding council, which covers further education. Otherwise, there will be more of an overlap and less co-ordination.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) spoke eloquently about special educational needs, in which he has a particular interest. I hope that the Committee has learnt how easy it is to forget the requirements of the special needs sector. On Second Reading, Conservative Members who were worried about the Bill were anxious mainly about its provision for special needs pupils who did not have statements. I sensed that Ministers were beginning to take account of those matters. I almost saw the flash of light as the Secretary of State realised that some special needs pupils did not have statements and that their needs had not been sufficiently considered in the Bill. Those special—if I may use the word—people, who need special attention must be at the forefront of everyone's minds when decisions are taken. There is a danger that their interests will be ignored if they are not represented by groups and organisations who can bring their needs to the attention of the opinion makers and decision takers. Those needs were ignored when the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
Bill was drafted and they may be ignored, too, by the funding agency unless there is special provision to prevent it.<br><br>
It is all too evident that equal opportunity needs are ignored. It is essential that the funding agency includes people whose role is to remind the agency of equal opportunities for women and girls, for those with disabilities and for those of different races, creeds and ethnic groups. I do not suggest that the funding agency will deliberately take a course of action that is unfair to those groups but dominant groups in our society tend to forget the interests of others. It is crucial that someone on the funding agency bears responsibility so that, at the appropriate moment, equal opportunity needs are on the agenda and can be discussed. To have to pick up the pieces because the needs of certain groups have been forgotten sends a message to people in our society that the decision-takers do not care. It is as much for their protection that we give the message that we care about all groups and all people. One way to ensure that special interests are taken into account is to ensure that the bodies include people who are responsibile for reminding us about people's needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Education Act 1981 provides that the needs of the pupil are assessed and that the resources should follow. That is another complication about the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is another reason to support the amendment and ensure that the interests of special needs and other groups are protected.<br><br>
We should consider, too, the different needs of rural and urban areas and the issue of surplus places and small schools. Conservative Members who represent rural constituencies know only too well that schools in rural areas are of a different size to those in urban areas. The distances travelled to school differ, depending upon the location of the school. Would hon. Members be happy living in a rural area if no member of a funding agency had the power to deal with surplus places and no account was taken of their needs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Porter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Waveney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may recall that I made the same point on Second Reading. Does she accept that in my county, the LEA headquarters is 40 or more miles away from the constituency? People feel that that is no more locally based than if it were 100 or 200 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, but I do not know where the hon. Gentleman's constituency is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Waveney.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not therefore, understand why, if the hon. Gentleman is not happy with an administrative headquarters 40 miles away, he will be happy with one 200, 300 or 400 miles away from those whom he represents. If the hon. Gentleman does not believe there is any difference, I suggest that he goes to the north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west of England, let alone to Birmingham. He should ask people there if they have more access to decision-takers 40 miles or 400 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The test of whether a local education authority is responsive to the needs of individual schools
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
is how the schools treat the LEA. In Suffolk, not one school has sought grant-maintained status because they are all satisfied with the service that they receive from the Suffolk LEA. Other authorities, which may be closer to individual schools, treat the schools in such a way that they want to escape. The majority of LEAs are supportive. The danger with the Bill is that, because of the wrongdoings or failures of a handful of LEAs, the remaining 116 may be blackened. That would be regrettable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. That is one of the faults of the last three Conservative Governments. In remedying minor errors, they have destroyed many good things.<br><br>
The main reason why I support the amendments is my firm belief that previous experience is crucial in helping people to form opinions and to make decisions. It influences us in our daily lives. It would be wrong if members of the funding agency did not have experience of representing local communities. We must legislate to require that.<br><br>
I sense agreement on the substance of the amendment. Conservative Members have no objection to people with experience of special education needs serving on the funding agency, or to people from rural or urban areas, to those who care about equal opportunity, or to those with links with FE or LEAs. There is essentially no difference of opinion about whether people with such backgrounds would make good members of the funding agency. The difference between us seems to be whether we should legislate to ensure that that happens. Part of our job as legislators is to safeguard minority interests and to protect the interests of people who will be affected by legislation. We cannot leave that to the will or whim of this or any future Secretary of State for Education. The funding agency should represent the people it seeks to serve.<br><br>
That amendment would strengthen the funding agency, which is currently perceived as being weak, the creature of the Secretary of State and removed from those it seeks to serve. The amendment would increase the funding agency's credibility in the public's eyes and allow it to gain the confidence of those in the education world who will have to work closely with it. It would enable Parliament to assist the Secretary of State in shaping the membership of the funding agency. That is right and proper.<br><br>
The amendments will enshrine in law a provision to protect forever and a day the interests of minority and special groups and difficult communities because they will be represented on the funding agency. To offer that protection and to gain credibility for the funding agency, I hope that Conservative Members will see fit to support our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of amendments in this group. It is inevitable—as shown by the hon. Member for Stretford—that the debate will be wide-ranging. Therefore, it will please you, Sir John, to know that I do not intend to say much about the amendments other than those in my name. However, I should like to place on record that lack of mention of a particular amendment should not be interpreted as lack of support.<br><br>
All the amendments are designed to ensure that the agency has the widest possible breadth of experience and understanding of educational issues. That is even more important in view of the intervention of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, who told us that there is yet another
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
function for the funding agency: devil's advocate. I am not sure which clause contains that responsibility. That gives us some idea of the kind of Government amendment that we can expect. An observer of the Government's inaction over recent years would notice that they are attempting to create a new political class. Almost every Government reform, regardless of which Department it comes from, seems to involve the establishment of a new quango, often comprising people who are sympathetic to the current regime, in place of a democratically accountable body. We need only look at the people who now run national health service trusts, which replaced the democratically elected health authorities, to understand the way in which Ministers from various Departments can operate. The hon. Member for Warrington, South has already made a similar point.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
My fear is that the membership of the funding agency for schools will consist of a narrow range of business men and business women and a few sympathetic educationists.<br><br>
The amendment's aim is to give the Secretary of State a statutory duty to ensure that the funding agency has a balanced membership.<br><br>
Amendment No. 35 clearly aims to ensure that most members of the funding agency have educational experience, not, as the the Bill oddly stipulates, that the majority should be people with experience of "any profession".<br><br>
I am the first to accept that it would be beneficial to have non-educationists in the agency. It is vital that the educationists—if they can be called that—have the expertise of the non-educationists to remind them of the outside world, not least the important world of work.<br><br>
As the Bill is drafted, however, it appears to give equal rating to non-educationists and educationists. The agency is supposed to be a body of experts with the relevant knowledge to make decisions on education. Therefore, there should be a majority—not a totality—of people on that body with recent and relevant educational experience.<br><br>
Through amendment No. 14, we try to make the point—for which, I hope, there will be wide acceptance—that there is no such thing as a normal school that can serve as a model for all schools. Schools serving different communities have different tasks and different needs. Sadly, that fact is neither recognised nor reflected by the Government in their approach to education, as can be illustrated by the publication, in the past 24 hours, of examination results.<br><br>
A body that serves a diverse range of grant-maintained schools should comprise people with experience in different schools. They need experience throughout the broad range of educational provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's argument. If one goes back to the local education authorities or to school governor boards, there is no legal stipulation about what kind of experience the membership of such bodies should have. Those people have a broad range of experience and, one hopes, are willing to learn and pick up the expertise needed to assist with the management and running of education.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will note that schedule 1 gives the funding authorities the power to appoint staff within the limits of numbers laid down by the Secretary of State. LEAs appoint experts, if they are needed, and ensure that funding authorities include a wide range of people, many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
of whom have relevant experience. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, acting on the advice of my hon. Friend the Minister, has made sure that there is such a range of people. That does not need to be stipulated in the Bill, when enacted. We need to ensure that there are skilled people who can appoint the experts needed to develop the specialities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, but he implied that the funding agency for schools and the local education authority care comparable. He fails to recognise the fundamental difference between the two: one is a democratically elected body and the other a quango.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little out of touch with best practice in local government, but when I was a member of a local education committee—a Conservative-controlled education committee—it co-opted specialists in further education, special education and in primary and secondary education. We are arguing for the same conditions for the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that comment.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Battersea will take on board the fact that there is genuine concern, certainly among Opposition Members and, I suspect, many people outside the House, that unless the composition and membership of the funding agency are clearly specified, it will merely be a puppet of the Secretary of State, as it was so eloquently put by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not: I am speaking for myself.<br><br>
Many of us heard the hon. Gentleman's argument during the debate on the Education Reform Act 1987, although the argument then related to the governing bodies of schools. The governing bodies of schools function perfectly well and I am at a loss to understand why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the funding councils will not function equally well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being rescued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to be rescued.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman share my confusion that the Government believe that there is no need to stipulate membership of the funding agency, but that clause 1 tries to do that, albeit in a limited way? Clause 1 states that members of the agency should be persons who appear to have,
<br><blockquote><p>"experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters or the practice of any profession."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Member for Bath share my puzzlement as to why the Government are happy to define membership of the funding agency for that group of people, but are reluctant to go beyond them in offering others membership?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's puzzlement. More generally, I am puzzled that Conservative members oppose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
the amendment. I genuinely fail to understand why they oppose a proposition to ensure that the composition of a body that will have wide-ranging powers over a growing number of schools, and that Opposition Members believe to be important, includes a wide range of differing expertise? Why do the Government object to that being ensured in the framework of the legislation?<br><br>
It is important that part of the range of expertise reflects experiences in inner-city and rural schools. That is the purpose of the amendment. We want to ensure that there will be members of the funding agency who have expertise on, for example, rural schools.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter) suggested that because the local education authority was quite a distance from some of the rural schools in his constituency, it did not serve them too well. He would agree, therefore, that it is important to include on the local education authority—or, in this case, the funding agency—someone with specific experience of provision of education in rural schools. Similarly, it is important to include someone with experience of education in inner-city schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 13 makes a simple proposal, with which I am sure there will be no dispute. While the underlying principles of the provision of education may never be lost, the practice of teaching and the problems encountered in schools change. Therefore, we should look for people with recent experience in education. The Government like the phrase, "recent and relevant experience" and they require people who train teachers to have recent and relevant experience of education in the classroom. Presumably, the same principle should apply to members of the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 gives us an opportunity to explore an area on which I seek a response from the Minister. It proposes that experience in inspecting schools should be included in clause 1. Does the Minister consider that that important experience should be reflected in the membership of the funding agency for schools? Since the Education (Schools) Act 1992, people with business experience have been able to inspect schools and vice versa. Such people could be included in paragraph 3(a) or 3(b). Does the Minister think it would be useful to include one person with experience of inspecting educational establishments?<br><br>
Amendment No. 16, like amendments Nos. 56, 23 and 25, refers to expertise in special educational needs. Several hon. Members have already spoken about that and I do not wish to elaborate further. The amendment would include
<br><blockquote><p>"a person who appears to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, the provision of special needs education."</p></blockquote>
The value of such experience is obvious and has been mentioned already by other hon. Members.<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 17 would include people with experience of school financing, whose contribution would benefit the funding agency. Overall, the other amendments would redress the balance of membership. The Government have put too much emphasis in the Bill on people with business rather than educational backgrounds. The amendments do not deny the value of including people with business backgrounds in the membership of the funding agency, but they would put more emphasis on including people who have recent wide-ranging experience in educational provision. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
would also make it a statutory duty to ensure that a wide range of experience is reflected in the membership of the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 14 would omit lines 18 to 25, but there is no mention in the hon. Gentleman's amendments of people with a business background. They are not included in the range of people whom he would contemplate as members of the agency. Is that right?</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. If the hon. Gentleman reads the group of amendments, he will see that the problem does not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to his amendment No. 14, which would omit lines 18 to 25 and insert two paragraphs (a) and (b), in which there is no mention of people with business or financial experience. Such people are specifically excluded by the amendment which he moved on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support this group of amendments and specifically amendment No. 23. I said earlier that the funding agency will be in operation in many areas very soon after the Bill is enacted because some grant-maintained schools have already opted out. As soon as the Bill is enacted, approximately 30 areas will be covered by the funding agency because they will have gone above the 10 per cent. entry point. The Minister said earlier that one local authority—I believe that it was Hillingdon—had gone above 75 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This gives me the opportunity to set the record straight. Hillingdon has reached 60 per cent., but has not yet reached 75 per cent., and over 20 authorities have passed the 10 per cent. mark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for providing the exact figures. I am pleased that the number of areas is only 20, which is fewer than we thought, although one seems to be approaching 75 per cent.<br><br>
The funding agency will have many powers and important duties, regardless of the number of grant-maintained schools in the area covered. Those responsibilities and duties will cover various matters—for example, calculation of the level of capital funding and revenue funding, allocation of capital and revenue, and advising the Secretary of State to help him to deal with parental complaints when grant-maintained schools fail to meet their statutory obligations. The funding agency will have extensive powers—the same powers as local education authorities now have.<br><br>
We must remember that the funding agency will be set up by the Secretary of State with no democratic selection procedure. It will be there because the Secretary of State put it there. If history is anything to go by, the agency will consist of political appointees, as happened with the National Curriculum Council and the School Examinations and Assessment Council. The latter is controlled by a chairman who was Mrs. Thatcher's guru in Downing street. That was a political appointment.<br><br>
The funding agency must not only be publicly accountable, but must include people with experience in education. I believe that the Government's intention is that funding agencies will take over completely from local authorities, which are democratically elected. If that is to be the case and with the Bill as drafted and the proposed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
composition of the funding agency, I do not believe that the agency would be democratically elected or accountable. The proposed funding agency for schools would not be representative, let alone democratic. There is a need to establish balanced representation to include teachers, parents and people with experience of, for example, equal opportunities or special needs work. We do not need puppets appointed by the Tory Government. They have done that in the past by their appointments to Government quangos and agencies. We want people on the funding agency who are experienced and interested in education and who have something to offer specifically to education.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley said, the Government shows no understanding of or interest in equal opportunities. The proposals leave a vacuum in the provision of advice and support for schools on equal opportunity issues. There would be no mechanism adequately to fund equal opportunity initiatives.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I referred to teachers because I was astounded that a Bill which has more than 250 clauses hardly mentions teachers or the teaching profession. I find that unbelievable. There is no inclination towards establishing a serious dialogue with the teaching profession in the attempt to improve schools. I have heard nothing about the statutory role of the teaching profession in the improvement of the quality of education. The absence of a commitment to working in partnership with teachers reveals how little understanding the Government have about how schools are run and how they can be improved.<br><br>
If schoolteachers are to respect the funding agency and to have confidence in it, it is essential that they are effectively represented. Qualified teachers must be appointed to the funding agency. Without in-depth knowledge of the process of teaching and learning, the funding agency could not do its job properly and would get no respect from the teaching profession.<br><br>
I am one of the longest-serving Members in the Committee—which is extraordinary as I have been here only five years—and I am one of the oldest. This Bill reminds me of the Education Reform Act 1987. As I said at the beginning of the week, déjàvu—it is happening all over again. What springs to mind about that Act is the Select Committee meeting a Secretary of State for Education before the Bill was committed to Standing Committee. We asked the Secretary of State who would be considered for an inspector's position. He said that he saw no reason why anyone could not be a school inspector. That was an incredible statement, particularly because it was made by a Secretary of State for Education. I asked him if the local butcher could become a school inspector. Incredibly, he said yes. That was repeated in the Standing Committee. I have nothing against butchers—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—in fact, I am friendly with several butchers, but I do not believe that butchers have an active role to play in our education system. Butchers can take an interest in education, but I do not think that they should participate in education. I should not want to work in the butcher's shop because I have no experience of working in a butcher's shop. I should not expect the butcher to be an inspector or a member of the funding agency. However, according to the Bill and the previous Secretary of State, there is no reason why a butcher—or anybody else—should not be a member of the funding agency.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we should get away from butchers and return to the meat of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have the <i>Official Report</i> of Standing Committee J on the Education Reform Bill, on which the hon. Gentleman, myself and other members of the Committee sat. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, will he say at what column is the reference to butchers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer. If the hon. Gentleman had listened carefully, he would have heard that I did not say that that was in the Committee on the Education Reform Bill, but I was referring to the Education (Schools) Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. The hon. Gentleman is so confused that, occasionally, he almost confuses me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would not be very hard to do.<br><br>
I believe that educationists have an important role to play in our education system, despite what the Government might say. Teachers in opt-out schools will need to have confidence in the funding agency. Perhaps more importantly, parents who have children in schools that have opted out must have confidence in the funding agency.<br><br>
Parents will want to be assured that people with the ultimate responsibility for their children know something about the education system. The Bill would not provide that assurance and the people who it seems will be members of the funding agency certainly will not know anything about education: estate agents, accountants, solicitors and God knows who will have a role to play, but certainly not in the education of our children, and certainly not in the education of my children. I want my children educated by educationists and by people who know what they are talking about. For so long, the teaching profession and teachers have taken tremendous stick—they do a damn good job, without the recognition that they deserve.<br><br>
The funding agency constitution states that it would have to
<br><blockquote><p>"ensure every child of compulsory school age in GM schools is being suitably educated."</p></blockquote>
How can somebody without a background in education know that? I do not think that that is possible—only a professional or an expert would know that. The constitution also states that the funding agency would
<br><blockquote><p>"propose closure, elargement or significant change of the character of … a school."</p></blockquote>
How can anyone who is not an expert in education make such decisions? I could go on and on about the composition and constitution of the funding agency. Every one of the funding agency's responsibilities—</span></p>

<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult to resume after an interruption, especially after the recent chaotic scenes in the Chamber. I should be delighted if someone could tell me what happened, as I do not know.<br><br>
As I was saying before the Division Bells rang, every one of the funding agency's responsibilities will call for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
special expertise, none more so than the duty to have regard to the need for secure and special education provision and to ensure maintenance of places for pupils with statements. Clearly, that will be a highly important function, but I do not see how it can be achieved if the funding agency does not have members with the necessary expertise.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Hillingdon funding authority had taken over nearly 75 per cent. of the local aducation authority's responsibilities. When the 75 per cent. level is reached, the funding authority will have to take over the strategic role of the LEA to ensure that sufficient school places exist. I do not understand how the funding authority can fulfil that role if its membership does not include people with the appropriate expertise. How can people have confidence if the funding agency or the funding authorities do not include people with professional expertise? Teachers and parents in grant-maintained schools must be confident that the funding agency knows what it is doing. That can be ensured only if the membership includes prefessionals and experts.<br><br>
I shall go further, and say that more is required than expertise in education. What, after all, is an education expert? The membership should include experienced teachers from the primary, secondary, special needs and further education sectors. Only yesterday, Lady Warnock told the Select Committee on Education that she became very angry when it was said that parents knew better than teachers. She said that her experience was that teachers know better than parents. I agree with her. Teachers are experts. They are properly trained and know better than most parents, among whom I include myself—although I should add that I include myself as a teacher as well, so I represent the best of both worlds. However, my point is that the funding agency will not be taken seriously unless its membership represents the range of experience that I have described.<br><br>
Early on in our debate, the Minister said that the Bill was drafted in a way that did not rule anyone out. I wrote that phrase down when the Minister used it. My interpretation is different: I believe that the Bill should ensure that certain people are on the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he opposes the inclusion of people with industrial, commercial or professional experience? If he does, will he vote against amendment No. 23?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I apologise if I have not made that clear. I believe that there should be a majority of teachers and educational experts on the funding agency but that there is a minor role for people with business and commercial experience.<br><br>
I shall conclude by quoting from the submission of the Secondary Heads Association, which I consider to be an organisation of educational experts. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is difficult to accept that a new quango, the FAS could expect to attract the trust and respect of the education professional when its membership is to be entirely determined by the current Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
To ensure that the funding agency has the trust and respect of the education profession, it must be assembled in a way that will be acceptable to the educational world and to parents.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Originally, because this matter is at the core of what is wrong with the Bill, I intended to emulate the secretary-general of the Italian Socialist party, whom I once heard speak on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Sicily for six and three quarter hours without repeating himself, and using the most beautiful gestures that I have ever seen. However, my hon. Friends have been so eloquent that I need not speak longer than three hours this evening.<br><br>
Let us turn our attention to numbers. The Minister said that there should be a variety of representation on the funding agency. I do not find that body satisfactory, but the Government are determined to have it and we shall find it difficult to change their mind. That is a shame because it is a disservice to some positive aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
The Government have proposed an oligarchy: in its place, the amendment proposes a pleonarchy, which would be more satisfactory. We could consider the qualifications that are genuinely required if the body is to be effective.<br><br>
I was sorry to hear the hon. Member for Hertsmere speak, in a callow way, as if the whole thing would fail if there were no financial genius on the board of governors. Clearly, it is important that there are representatives of commercial life from the trade unions and the bosses' organisation, the Confederation of British Industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respectfully draw to the hon. Gentleman's attention that the amendment tabled by members of his party suggests that people with experience in financial matters could be on the so-called funding council. Is the hon. Gentleman speaking against that too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. He should pay careful attention. I know that that is difficult, as one has always had pupils whose minds wander and who do not concentrate on the point. I said that that is not the sole criterion. The hon. Gentleman was telling my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham how scandalous it was that it was not at the core of his argument, but it is part of an integrated whole. We should not concentrate on one subject to the exclusion of others. As my remarks made clear, I do not do so. As a firm supporter of Maastricht and of subsidiarity I support consultation with all social spheres, including education. However, the social sector should not be considered to the exclusion of all other bodies and experts. There should be a guarantee that the body will include people with real and recent experience of the various sectors of education. That should not be difficult. It has been done by a succession of local education authorities, of both parties.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wyre Forest used special pleading, but to argue ad hominem and take one authority as an example is not helpful. I know nothing about the authority, so the hon. Gentleman may be right or wrong. However, I could find rotten and splendid Conservative-controlled education authorities if I looked for them. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) was on the Cambridge education authority, which is Conservative. It considered the ratios, showed generosity and sought the views of experts to ensure that its advisory bodies were not staffed by right-wing, left-wing or centre Tories or even by Labour people. Because it had a good mixture and a balance of views, it brought to the people who use the service an important expertise.<br><br>
The old West Riding authority was very remote, as the proposed agency will be, but it took immense care to show
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
that it could take account of specific regions. It did that by appointing a series of divisional executives. When that Conservative authority was, alas, broken up by Peter Walker's reforms into smaller units, and education supposedly came closer to the people, it was perceived as being further away, because the units did not pay attention to schools' and people's needs. It seemed to the Government that Wakefield was close enough, but it was not.<br><br>
10.45 pm<br><br>
My genuine fear is about the way in which the agency and regional authorities will be set up. It is a delicate issue that requires more careful attention than the Government have given it. The Government should concentrate on schools' needs and difficulties. The Minister is too sensible to pretend that grant-maintained schools will suddenly become perfect. We know from experience that that will not happen. The Bill should contain safeguards. We should identify the dangers and guard against them. Expertise on funding bodies is a way to achieve that.<br><br>
How are we to get such expertise? Should we look to the Secretary of State, who will say, "Trust me"? I would not even trust my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury with the plenipotentiary powers that the Bill grants to the Secretary of State. Rab Butler saw such dangers in the 1940s. He said that the new Minister of State for Education
<br><blockquote><p>"would not be a kind of Educational Dictator".</p></blockquote>
He was right. I accept that occasionally directors of education, chairmen—and even chairwomen—of education are too powerful and have to be put down. Such overweening politicians are put down by people with expertise, not by political, commercial, or trade union representatives. They are put down by people who have the direction of education at heart, who have devoted their lives in education. When you talk—I mean, when the Government talk; you would never be so foolish, Sir John—about producer interest, I can only agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said. Producers, educators, those who have grown up in education are interested in the subject because they care for, and worry about, those whom they try to educate. We need such expertise on the funding agency.<br><br>
I disagree slightly with my hon. Friend. At the school where I taught, we consulted parents regularly and in depth and took their views into account. Some of the worst parents were teachers. Teachers are difficult parents. One had to be firm with them. I am sure I was just as much at fault about my four children as other teachers were about theirs. That does not mean that when educators, teachers and specialists examine and provide for individual schools, as is required in the Bill, they do anything but their level best. However, their level best may not always be brilliant; not all teachers are brilliant teachers. I am sure that that is not a blinding revelation. I have discovered from the European Parliament and the House that not all politicians are brilliant, with the exception, of course, of you, Sir John. The others tend to have failings and weaknesses. Your chairmanship is regularly, always and eternally impeccable.<br><br>
I feel strongly about the phrase in the Bill that <br><blockquote><p>"persons who appear to him"—</p></blockquote>
"him" being the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters or the practice of any profession."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
What sort of profession? Is it the profession of the ladies of the night? Must we have ladies of the night on the board of governors to ensure that the whole community is represented? Or is it confined professions? <i>[Interruption.]</i> I would give way to the hon. Member for Battersea but he seems to prefer to remain seated beneath the lights of Battersea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is in danger of losing himself, perhaps I can help him to reorientate himself. His amendment refers to the practice of any profession. Presumably he understands the amendment that he supports, so if he can explain it to himself, he does not need us to explain the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but he will notice that I am not one of the signatories to the amendment. I am able to support that amendment because as long as the vital professions are represented I do not mind what other professions are included. We want a balance. We need more people with professional expertise in education and a few people with expertise in other areas. I would put even the Minister on the board of governors, with some misgivings I admit, but it would be interesting to educate him in that way.<br><br>
We need a local context. The Bill does not provide that. We can and shall do our level best to ensure that it is made less harmful, but we can do no better than that. At the heart, at the core, it is rotten because it takes education away from the people. It gives powers to the Secretary of State for Education; even if they were benign, he should not be allowed such powers. The Government's aim is centralisation of power. Problems would be created if we retrogressed, say, to the system in France where, as a result of centralised control, everyone studies geography at the same time every day.<br><br>
Increasingly, that is the course that the Government are taking. Clause 1 exemplifies that course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware that, over the years, the French system of education has been very centralised, with the French education Minister knowing at 3 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon in Paris that every 14-year-old throughout France would be reading French literature and that, on Monday morning, they would be studying mathematics.<br><br>
Over the past three or four years, however, because of the dead hand of that central control over the French education system, there has been a democratic move to devolve powers away from the centre out to the regions. Is it not interesting that France has learnt the lesson of its mistakes and is devolving power to democratically elected local communities? Does my hon. Friend agree that the Bill, if enacted, would produce the reverse of that proposal? There would be an over-centralisation of power in a sector that previously has played an important part in our democratic structure. The funding agency, an unelected body, would take over those controls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The French eventually looked at the British education system, because they wondered why the French system lacked some of the qualities of the British system. That led the French to move away from their kind of system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to do so.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's courtesy. While we are on the subject of the British education system, we should consider the Scottish education system, which works to one syllabus. It does not have the faults of the French system and I think that most people in the Committee would recognise its superiority over the English system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting a long way from discussing the membership of the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not trespassing on your good will, Sir John, by replying to the hon. Lady's point within the context of the Bill.<br><br>
The Scottish analogy is interesting because the Scots are not included in the Bill, in the same way that they are excluded from much of the centralisation powers. I know that now is certainly not the time to argue about decentralisation or about giving Scotland the powers that it deserves, but I think that we should be aware that the Government dare not do what they are doing to England and Wales. It is not until we in Yorkshire and Wales pick up—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that interventions will only encourage the hon. Gentleman. My concern is for him to return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to do so, but first I shall give way to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point about centralisation and choice, can I remind my hon. Friend and the rest of the Committee that, as one of the few people here who have actually had a Scottish education—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—I did say, "one of the few." I think that even Conservative Members ought to be able to work out that three such people out of the Committee amounts to only a few. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that standard assessment tasks and the other instruments of centralisation used by the Government are a matter of choice for Scottish teachers and parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for reminding me about that. My elder sister is a Scottish teacher. She rang me up and said, "God help you with this Bill and the central direction and the powers it gives. We're having a hard enough time with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The kind of time that you must be having with the Secretary of State for Education in England and Wales goes beyond comprehension." I agree with her and I agree my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that, almost irrespective of the effect of the amendments on the membership of the funding agency, many public schools in England and Wales will be outside its control?</span></p>
<p>11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that has long been my contention. Even before my hon. Friend was involved in education, I made precisely that point during an education debate. The Secretary of State should introduce similar powers over private education, especially in areas such as Surrey. Abuse is widespread and many parents are conned out of money. The Secretary of State should have power to ensure that those prep schools and secondary schools that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
badly serve pupils and parents are put right. That was not even included in the results. It was an optional extra. I look forward to the time when the Secretary of State will ensure that private schools receive the same treatment as public schools.<br><br>
However, I return to the question of qualification; of people knowing what they are doing on the ground—<i>[Laughter.]</i>—not in the sense that the Minister means.<br><br>
Professional expertise is important. We need people who know what goes on in schools, what should not go on in schools, and what goes on in different areas. It is nonsense to suggest that what is appropriate in Worcester is appropriate in Hemsworth. In England, we do not recognise the diversity of traditions and the diversity of cultural heritage. The actions of funding agencies can have a devastating effect on that. The result will be blanket uniformity. The agency will not be able to move up a hear here, turn a tack there. It will treat every school in the same dull, uniform way and it will stifle initiative in education. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
Of course I shall give way to the hon. Member for Battersea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not wish to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since it appears that the hon. Member for Battersea agrees with the dictates of the union to which he and I have allegiance, I shall conclude by reaffirming my commitment to bringing education to the level of teachers and pupils. A body such as the funding agency will be nothing but a hindrance. The best thing that the Minister can do is ensure that there is a majority of expertise on the dowdy body that he proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to follow the illuminating and learned contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth. It is useful for the Committee to have the opportunity to spend at least a few hours, if not days, considering the membership of the funding agency. Under the provisions of the Bill, or the landmark Christmas cake as the Minister has referred to it, the funding agency is an important ingredient. Therefore, we must give proper consideration to its membership.<br><br>
It is clear that, at least to begin with, the funding agency will have a clear and close relationship with schools that have achieved grant-maintained status. On Second Reading on Tuesday last week, we learnt that' 342 schools have achieved grant-maintained status, or at least been given approval to take grant-maintained status in the future. I do not know if there have been any additions since. If not, it has not been a good week for the Minister. The Government want more grant-maintained schools every day. It would be interesting if we had a week with no additions.<br><br>
In north Tyneside, which covers my constituency, the first ballot in the area on opting-out took place in the neighbouring constituency of Tynemouth and the parents voted not to leave the local authority family. That result was declared last Friday.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the 342 schools which have already been given grant-maintained status will work closely with the funding agency. It is relevant that those 342 schools are concentrated in particular parts of the country. One or two members of the Committee have already referred to the fact that the funding agency will come into operation very quickly once it is on the statute book in a handful of local education authority areas, where between 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. of children in the secondary sector are in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
schools that have opted out of local authority control and achieved grant-maintained status. In one authority—I think that it is Hillingdon—the figure is close to 75 per cent. Soon, in at least one local education authority area, the funding agency will take responsibility for strategic planning to take out surplus places and to ensure that enough places are available for children of school age in the secondary sector. Therefore, it is important that we ensure that the funding agency has the appropriate membership. That is the aim of the group of amendments.<br><br>
Earlier, we had a debate about the funding agency's powers in terms of council responsibilities. If grant-maintained status takes off and becomes the norm—I think that that is the expression used by the Secretary of State and other Ministers—the funding agency will be responsible for around 24,000 schools in England, employing about 400,000 teachers and another 400,000 non-teaching staff. We should not forget the non-teaching staff who support the teaching function in schools. We must bear in mind that the caretakers, the cleaners, the school meals staff and the secretaries play an important role in ensuring the quality of our children's education.<br><br>
If the majority of our schools achieve grant-maintained status, the funding agency will be responsible for about 800,000 employees. That is a massive responsibility and that is why we must ensure that the funding agency has the appropriate membership.<br><br>
The functions of the funding agency are such that it will be all-powerful in discharging its duties, although it will operate under the instruction and—I am sure—close guidance of the Secretary of State for Education.<br><br>
The functions of the funding agency are significant for the quality of education offered to our children. The funding agency will be responsible for paying annual maintenance grants to the governing bodies of all grant-maintained schools, the amount of which will be determined by the agency in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State. The agency will operate with an overall remit determined by the Secretary of State, but it will have wide discretion.<br><br>
Secondly, regulations may provide for payment by the funding agency of capital and special purpose grants to the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools. That is a significant power. Capital allocation causes great concern in many schools. I understand that local authorities have made submissions for capital allocations for 1993–94 of approximately £1·5 billion of capital approval for building programmes. The autumn statement provided less than £600 million, so many schools in many local education authority areas will be disappointed by the lack of capital to be made available. That and chronic under-investment for many years have resulted in a £4 billion backlog of outstanding capital works in our schools.<br><br>
Schools that achieve grant-maintained status will want capital support quickly and the funding agency will have responsibility for deciding between the competing bids from grant-maintained schools. The funding agency should reflect the needs of the various schools, but the narrow construction that the Bill gives to the membership of the agency will not achieve that objective.<br><br>
Special purpose grants will also come under the funding agency's responsibility. Local education authorities receive approval to borrow money in the market and council tax payers—or poll tax payers at present—must repay money that is borrowed to support capital applications. Under the Bill, the funding agency will make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
a grant of money to schools and will not have to borrow the money in the market, so it will not have the debt repayments that local authorities have. The funding agency needs representation that reflects its powerful position.<br><br>
The funding agency will also be responsible for paying grants to the governing body of grant-maintained schools for any expenditure incurred before the implementation of the proposals where it is incurred for the purpose of, or in connection with, the transition of the school to grant-maintained status. We are all aware from our experience with schools that have sought grant-maintained status that those additional sums of money have often been a source of conflict between schools. The money seems to be allocated not on a per capita basis, but in an ad hoc way that does not reflect the needs and costs of a school in achieving grant-maintained status.<br><br>
The funding agency will have the power to pay grants to the governing body of any grant-maintained school that is being discontinued where it is for the purpose of discharging any of the liabilities of the governing body or for meeting any of the costs of winding-up that grant-maintained school. That is a sensitive function which would be the responsibility of the funding agency—the power to wind up a governing body and to make the payments necessary to discharge the legal liability of that grant-maintained school.<br><br>
11.15 pm<br><br>
We are all aware that if a grant-maintained school, for whatever reason, needs to be wound up, the primary responsibility for doing that lies with the funding agency, which may, for example, decide to take such action because it wants to remove surplus places. The agency would have to negotiate with the governing body, which would have the legal responsibility for liabilities. There could be a conflict between the governing body and the funding agency about the amount of money available to discharge those liabilities. In such sensitive circumstances, we would need to have a sensitive funding agency.<br><br>
Clause 5(1)(a) states that the funding agency
<br><blockquote><p>"shall provide the Secretary of State with such information or advice in connection with any function of his relating to the provision of education as he may from time to time require".</p></blockquote>
Clause 5(1)(b) states that the agency
<br><blockquote><p>"may provide the Secretary of State with such information or advice relating to such provision as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
That would require a body of people able to provide that information.<br><br>
We are concerned that, as the Bill is drafted, a group of people with narrow interests would be appointed to the funding agency.<br><br>
The Bill would allow the Secretary of State other powers to deal with the grant-maintained sector which, if he wishes, he could transfer to the funding agency.<br><br>
There are further powers that are not given immediately to the funding agency. The Bill does not contain a fixed list of responsibilities for the agency but outlines the bare minimum of powers and responsibilities that the funding agency may be given. The Secretary of State would have the power to transfer—delegate—responsibilities to the funding agency. It would be a growing power with growing responsibilities.<br><br>
It is instructive to consider what those additional powers might be. The Secretary of State could create new and modify instruments of government and articles of government. The governing body of a school is very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
important for the direction and success of that school. The role of a governing body is crucial and the power to establish those governing bodies could be given to the funding agency. The Secretary of State could delegate to the funding agency the function of determining proposals significantly to change the character or enlarge the premises of a grant-maintained school. That is the hidden agenda at the heart of the Bill—the power to change the character of the school. We all know that that is a code for the examination that dare not speak its name, the 11-plus, and the return to selection. The Secretary of State would not determine whether a school could introduce selection; that enormous power could be delegated to the funding agency. If the funding agency is to have that power, it needs to have a broadly based membership that reflects a variety of different views. I hope that the Minister will accept that that is the meaning behind the wording of the Bill. If the Secretary of State so determined, he could empower the funding agency which, at the request of a governing body, could change the character of a school. That is an important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled by the inconsistency between the hon. Gentleman's comments on the funding agency and those of the hon. Member for Hemsworth, who talked about the funding agency leading to drab uniformity. The hon. Member for Wallsend says that the funding agency will introduce selection and specialisation. Opposition Members must decide what they do not like about the funding agency and why. Are they opposed to drab uniformity or to the opportunities for new systems and specialisation? They cannot have it both ways. They have been trying to have it both ways for most of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to highlight the powerful role that the funding agency will play and to stress that, because of those powers, its membership must be broadly representative.<br><br>
We are worried that the Bill provides for a narrow group of people—perhaps no more than 10—in a funding agency that will be responsible for 24,000 schools employing 400,000 teachers and 400,000 non-teaching staff. Our argument is that it is inappropriate for such a small group of people to have overriding power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the introduction of selection here and something else there is scarcely exciting diversity, which is what we wanted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We want a diverse form of education that catches the imagination of all our children and not just of a small minority. Our concern about the powers of the funding agency is that it can, if the Secretary of State so determines, approve a fundamental change of character in a school, which may mean the introduction of selection. The funding agency will have the power to authorise the transfer of a grant-maintained school to a different site. That may not appear terribly significant, but it may mean that the school can no longer serve its community as was originally intended.<br><br>
If the power to move a school is combined with the power to change the articles for governance of a grant-maintained school, the important bonds that tie a school to its local community will be loosened and weakened by the provisions of the Bill, when enacted.<br><br>
The funding agency will have the power to discontinue a grant-maintained school, if there is a direct approach
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
from the governing body. It will have the power in certain circumstances to vary trust deeds for grant-maintained schools and the power, by order, to make such provision as appropriate in connection with the school's transition to grant-maintained status. Such powers, duties and responsibilities are important. The funding council is at the heart of the Bill and must have an appropriate membership.<br><br>
In addition to all those detailed powers, the funding agency's most significant responsibility is for strategic planning in a local education authority area. Later in our proceedings, we shall consider clause 7, which deals with the crossover period between the ending of the local education authority's control and responsibility and the beginning of the responsibilities of the funding agency. During the crossover period, there will be a dual responsibility between the funding agency and the local education authority, if between 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. of school children in an education authority are in schools that have achieved grant-maintained status. No doubt, we shall debate the merit of that provision, but, in order to achieve that dual responsibility, the funding agency must be able to work in partnership with the local education authority.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wyre Forest said that partnership is a two-way thing. We have a responsibility to ensure that the funding agency can work constructively with the local education authority. Therefore, the membership of the funding agency must reflect its powers and responsibilities.<br><br>
The funding agency will have 10 to 15 members. Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 would increase membership to 15 to 20. The White Paper that initiated the Bill was called "Choice and Diversity". We are trying to introduce diversity into membership of the funding agency. Only a membership of 15 to 20 can reflect the responsibilities of the funding agency. A small membership of perhaps as few as 10 will not be able to deal with those responsibilities.<br><br>
The wording of amendment No. 23 is restrictive. The amendment would ensure that members of the funding agency have expertise in specific areas. We make no apology for circumscribing the membership of the agency in that way. Certain interest groups and certain areas of specialism must be represented on the funding agency. The clause is too loosely worded. The agency must include an expert in primary or secondary education. It is important to include people with experience of mainstream schooling. Many people who have served on school governing bodies know the difficulties of, for example, tackling the school budget, for which they have responsibility, or of demographic changes, which alter the number of pupils entering the school from one year to the next. The agency should include an expert in further education. One of the great failures of our education system is the chronically low staying-on rate post-16. We have improved that by establishing clear and constructive links between the schools sector and the further education sector.<br><br>
The funding agency should also include an expert on special educational needs. It is crucial that that all-too-often neglected sector has a voice on the funding agency. No doubt we have all been approached by groups representing the special needs sector, and who wish it to have a voice on the agency. The Opposition endorse such a view. We also need to maintain links with the local education authority. There will be a difficult period where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
there will be a dual relationship between the local education authority and the funding agency. There needs to be someone in the agency with experience and knowledge of how LEAs work.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
Finally, we say that there should be someone in the agency with industrial, commercial or financial experience. We understand the arguments that the funding agency will benefit from members with experience of those skills. However, those members should be a broadly representative group rather than form the over-riding majority of the agency. The purpose of amendment No. 35 is to ensure that the majority of the membership of the funding agency will
<br><blockquote><p>"have experience of the provision of education".</p></blockquote>
There is a danger that, as the Bill stands, the agency could be based on a membership of people who have financial or industrial expertise but who lack experience of the world of education.<br><br>
The Bill gives enormous power to the funding agency. We are concerned that the membership will be too narrowly based. The amendments aim to broaden membership of the agency in a constructive way which will reflect its responsibilities, duties and functions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I underscore the point about special needs education. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend has said, the Opposition have tried to increase the size of the agency so as to encourage more diversity in its membership. We also want to ensure that there are at least two members of the agency with relevant, recent experience in special needs education.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Bill makes improvements in the treatment of statemented children. I am sure that the Government are prepared to consider further improvements. We believe that there are still problems for children without a statement but with learning difficulties that require special support. There are already such children—some with a statement, some without—in grant-maintained schools. The agency will be responsible for planning provision, funding schools and liaising with the relevant LEAs, three sectors that will have a significant impact on children with special educational needs in grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
The funding agency will share responsibility with the local authority for the provision of sufficient places in the local authority area. Once again, that could have a significant impact on provision made for children with special educational needs. The funding agency will distribute maintenance grants, special purpose grants and capital grants, and will need to take account of the impact of the distribution of the money on children with special educational needs.<br><br>
In England and Wales, there are about 170,000 children with a statement and over 1 million without a statement but who require special help—a considerable number of children. The funding agency will need to consider how to make buildings accessible to pupils with physical disabilities. It will be responsible for installing a loop for hearing-impaired children, for providing braille facilities and enlarged photocopying facilities for children with visual problems. The list is endless. It will have an important role in liaising with local authorities in respect of work with children in grant-maintained schools who are in the pre-statutory school-based stages of assessment, who are undergoing full assessment or for whom
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
additional assessment is to be paid as specified in a statement. All such matters must be taken care of at LEA level and at funding agency level with liaison between them. It is essential for at least two members of the funding agency to have expertise in those areas.<br><br>
The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation has told me some of the problems that are already occurring and which the funding agency will have to take into account. For example, a five-year-old wheelchair user in East Anglia has been refused entry to her local mainstream primary school, which her older brother attends, because of the financial implications of adapting the school. Grant-maintained schools will receive little incentive or encouragement to address the broad and complex range of special educational needs.<br><br>
RADAR also provides evidence from East Anglia of the multiple exclusion of children with complex emotional and behavioural difficulties. Such children are not naughty in the usual sense which those of us who have been teachers would understand. The problem is that the schools do not know how to cater for their needs, but such children will have to be catered for and it is essential for the funding agency to have members with expertise in those specific areas.<br><br>
Another example of the sort of problems that will have to be faced concerns a seven-year-old lad called Kevin who suffers from cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and visual impairment. He has been assessed as needing special seating and physiotherapy to allow the fullest possible access to the curriculum. The local health authority has refused to provide it because the provision is needed in school and the authority argues that the local education authority is responsible.<br><br>
Such problems are arising now. The funding agency will face complex problems and will need expertise within the agency. There is no reference in the Bill to the need for knowledge of special education. The case for at least two members of the funding agency to have such expertise is overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with this part of the debate is that Opposition Members are missing the obvious. I must remind the Committee of the obvious—something that I am usually reluctant to do. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wants the funding agency for schools to work effectively. It is in the interests of my right hon. Friend, the Government and of education that the funding agency for schools is effective, respected and trusted by those who seek something from our education system—mainly the parents. It is absurd to suggest that any Secretary of State for Education would deliberately sabotage his own funding agency for schools by appointing to it people who are inappropriate or will not do the best possible job in discharging its responsibilities under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that mainly parents would be interested in the operation of the funding agency for schools. Does not the Minister recognise that the teachers in those grant-maintained schools will have an interest, as will the local communities which those schools serve? The parents are equally important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I do. Everyone in education would be interested in the operation of the funding agency. We turn increasingly to the views of parents, who are consumers, not producers, about what is happening.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
The provisions in the Bill are enabling provisions. They exclude no one. They would allow the Secretary of State to have the widest possible choice of people to serve on the agency. He or she would look for the best people across society to discharge the responsibilities of the agency. The Bill would help the Secretary of State by identifying both
<br><blockquote><p>"persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, the provision of primary and secondary education"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters or the practice of any profession."</p></blockquote>
That would be sensible, practical guidance for the Secretary of State about who should serve on the agency. That is uncontroversial and straightforward. It must be right to allow the Secretary of State to exercice the widest discretion to pick a team of people who would work effectively together, with the common objective of providing the best education that the agency can achieve.<br><br>
The amendments are wrong in principle because they would be over-prescriptive. It is wrong to try to tie the hands of the Secretary of State in the way that the amendments would. Also, the amendments would not add up—rather, they would add up and add up excessively. Not only is there a reduction to absurdity but an expansion to absurdity, which is almost to infinity. The categories mentioned by Opposition hon. Members in the debate include special educational needs, primary and secondary education, further education, LEAs, rural and inner-city areas, provision and responsibility of inspections, race relations, equal opportunities, the financing of schools and people with industrial, commercial, financial and professional experience. Two from each of those categories—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who said two?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It says "persons" in the amendments. I have just counted that there are 13 categories. There would have to be two people from each of those, plus the additional provision that the experience would have to be recent and long-standing. I do not believe that in a funding agency with 10 members—let alone 15 or even 20—it would be possible to achieve a balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister realise that some people do not have a one-track mind or a one-track experience, and that people would have experience of many of those categories?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all familiar with that scenario. It is the disabled lady single parent and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no need for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am making a practical point. If the amendments were accepted, the hon. Gentleman would be looking for people with a peculiar combination of those areas of expertise in order to meet the absurd requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister calms down and asks himself whether he has been a trifle offensive, perhaps he can consider that there might, for example, be a primary teacher who is experienced at teaching a multi-racial class in an inner-city area. Do we want to knock that person and suggest that he or she has no qualities that could be useful to the agency? If the Minister is saying that no such person
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
would apply, that confirms our great concerns about the narrowness of the type of people who would be appointed to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are becoming deliberately obtuse, which is perhaps understandable at this hour. I invited Opposition Members to consider the absurdity of the amendments and suggested that there would be no way in which they could meet their own requirement in the size of agency that we plan or even in the size of agency that their amendments suggest would be needed. The hon. Member for Hemsworth said that there were people who could qualify because they would have multiple experience. Trying to find multiply qualified people who meet several categories so that all the boxes can be ticked off is no way to select members of an agency. It is not serious. It pursues tokenism and representation of the most trivial type.</span></p>
<p>11.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that statement, the Minister confirmed all our worst fears about the Bill. That is a shame, because we are happy to work out a comprehensive list of 20 members with him and the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After consultation, the Secretary of State of the day will select the group of people able to make the best provision for the agency. It is as simple as that. It is not particularly complicated, although, as ever, it will be a difficult and demanding task to select those people. If we set out to constrain the Secretary of State in the Bill, the selection is likely to be made on the wrong basis and for the wrong reasons. That is the difficulty that we shall face if we are tempted by the amendments. I hope that the Committee will not be tempted because it would be a nightmare trying to fulfil unrealistic requirements.<br><br>
Our experience with other bodies is that it is possible to identify people who will be able to take full account of the needs and requirements of the group without sticking labels on them. I am concerned about the labelling fetish—it is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is becoming slightly ridiculous. He is saying that it is possible to achieve all the aims as long as we do not restrain the Secretary of State. If we constrain him to achieve the aims, he cannot do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that any Secretary of State appointing 10 or 15 members of a funding agency will be able to select people who are capable of taking into account all the diverse needs, including ones that go beyond this list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to help the hon. Gentleman, but if he wishes to intervene, I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will be helped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wants my help; good.<br><br>
We must not imagine that the funding agency employs 400,000 teachers or 400,000 other people associated with education. Grant-maintained schools will employ an increasing number of those people and the local education authorities will continue to employ those who are left in schools in the LEA sector. Because the funding agency will not employ those people, some of the arguments of the hon. Member for Wallsend were invalid—he was suggesting that, because the funding council would employ a large army of people, it would have to have certain characteristics.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At no stage did I say that the funding agency would be the employer. That is not the case and if the record shows that I said that, it was a mistake. I was clarifying that the funding agency had the responsibility to fund 400,000 teachers and 400,000 non-teaching staff. It will also have the power to wind schools up. It may not be the employer, but it will have the ultimate sanction because it will be able to stop money going to schools.<br><br>
The Minister may be aware that we are concerned about appointments to bodies such as the National Curriculum Council and the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council, particularly about the appointment of their heads. Will the Minister reflect on the qualifications of those individuals? At one time, they were both members of the No. 10 think tank, but what other qualifications do they have? Does the Minister understand our genuine concern that that is why we need a broadly representative group on the funding agency? Our experience shows that people appointed by the Government come from a narrow background.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share this thought with the hon. Gentleman even if the Committee were misguided enough to accept the amendments and the endless list of people that is proposed, an imaginative Secretary of State could still find people who were reasonably congenial to him and also fitted those descriptions. If Opposition Members think, in their present paranoid state, that they can somehow avoid the making of political appointments—which is what they imagine will happen—by sticking those labels on people, that is not the case. I could readily arrange to produce people who fitted those descriptions perfectly well and who I found politically genial. The immunisation and protection element that Opposition Members have frequently mentioned during the debate does not exist, contrary to what they imagine.<br><br>
Let us leave that matter and get back to the basics of this part of the Bill and the reason why the amendments are misguided and wrong-headed. We want an agency that will effectively discharge its many responsibilities within the statutory constraints. The formulation in the Bill makes satisfactory provision for that. It affords the Secretary of State many options and guides him in a reasonable way to establishing a balance on the agency between those with education experience and others with relevent experience. The agency will be involved in the distribution of ever-larger sums of public money and the effectiveness of the use of those resources. All of that is properly and adequately reflected both in the size of the agency and in the membership suggested.<br><br>
Recent experience shows for all to see that if we leave the Secretary of State of the day with such freedom, it will be discharged properly and responsibly. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments, because they would unnecessarily tie the hands of the Secretary of State and prejudice the effectiveness of the funding agency for schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems scarcely a moment ago that we began to debate the amendments, so gripping has been the general level of our discussion. Several important points have been made and some have even emanated from the Conservative Benches. I came to the Committee thinking that there would be a series of dummies on the Government Benches. I do not intend to be unkind because not all of them have yet proved that they are merely dummies. There have been expressions of genuine
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
concern and I am grateful that Conservative Members have stayed to listen to the debate. Virtually a full complement is assembled.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Waveney intervened to speak about an important issue and gave clear signals to the Minister that he could not go along with him. The hon. Gentleman talked about the occasional feelings of alienation in Suffolk because county hall was sometimes thought to be too far away from local communities. That occured in Suffolk where not one school has opted out, so even in a Tory authority where there is a belief that the opting out status is not necessary, there is a need to push responsibility down to local communities.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has proposed the abolition of the county council, but he may want the unitary authorities to be established at a lower level and education authorities to be nearer to the population.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I have long advocated the abolition of county councils, but the point I was trying to make when I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Yardley was that it makes no difference where the headquarters of an authority are situated; there is still a feeling of remoteness in rural Suffolk. If an authority is doing a good job, it can be 40 miles or 140 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He was saying that it would not matter if the county council covered a larger area. I am sure that he will accept—he has said that he believes in local democracy—that the democratic link is the most important thing. I think that he was signalling to the Minister that the lack of democracy in the funding agency worried him as much as it worries the Opposition. I understand why so many people in Suffolk want to retain the current system.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norwich, North raised the important matter of selection, which provoked an immediate spasm—perhaps an ideological spasm—in the Minister's head. The Minister, from a sedentary position, used the phrase, "the dead hand of comprehensive education."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In the context of the discussion on diversity, in which Opposition Members suggested that some schools would contemplate specialisation or even selection, I said that the dead hand of the comprehensive movement had sought to eliminate diversity. In that context, I am happy to confirm the comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are making progress. The Minister is making the point that comprehensive education is a dead hand—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but within the context of the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to explain away the Minister's comments. Perhaps that is the Minister's view of comprehensive education. We shall certainly bear that in mind in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Be my guest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I must warn the Minister that I live in an authority that has selective education. My children do not attend school in that authority because I have little time for the very poor system provided by Trafford county council. The Minister should be careful because the same process is just as capable of snuffing out the selective system of which he approves.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will remember, I was making the point that Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot allege that a funding agency will lead to drab uniformity and also complain about specialisation. The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of my intervention is wrong. Do the Opposition want a funding agency that will encourage uniformity or one that will encourage variety?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That gives me no great problem. The Opposition do not want a funding agency. We could replay the whoe debate from Second reading to make quite clear that we have opposed the funding agency, but hon. Members can read the record if they are in doubt. At the start of the debate, I invited the Minister to explain how he envisaged the funding agency operating. It provided an opportunity for him to place on record the way in which membership would be decided and how the Secretary of State would represent those diverse views. Nothing in the Minister's response led us to believe that the Secretary of State would want to operate in that way. The Minister said that the provisions would give guidance to the Secretary of State. It is ironic that the present Secretary of State, who, we are led to believe, wrote the Bill, is giving himself guidance on how he should appoint people. That is something of a nonsense. Perhaps the Minister has a view on how long the shelf life of a Secretary of State for Education might be.<br><br>
12 midnight<br><br>
It is not good enough to say that it is acceptable for the Secretary of State to specify certain members of the agency but that it is illegitimate for Opposition Members to suggest that other criteria ought to be used. The whole thing is fraught with difficulty. We are told that the Secretary of State can, if unguided by the Bill, manage to meet the requirements that we have expressed, yet if he is guided by the Bill he would find that terribly difficult. The Minister will understand that we cannot accept his posturing on that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
I believe that many Conservative Members have stayed to vote against the Minister. That has been quite obvious from their reactions and their refusals to intervene. I can see one or two of them girding their loins for that. I am grateful that they have stayed. We are beginning to close the circle. It is obvious that some hon. Members feel the need to demonstrate such political muscle in the Committee. The hon. Member for Battersea is a well-known supporter of special education. We know that he is one of the weaker links.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is after my loins again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going on about his loins. His comments are apropos of nothing. I do not think that I am even tempted, as the hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know. I see that you, Sir John, are not tempted. We can leave the hon. Gentleman's loins for another occasion.<br><br>
It is clear that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to be defeated by the sheer force of discontent among Conservative Members. It would be better if hon. Members, having waited this long, sought to persuade the Minister of the error of his ways. If he were to undertake to think long and hard about the illogicalities of his position, would he consider the possibility of prioritising on the aims contained in the amendments, and would he also particularly examine special needs education? I do not want to single that out, but it greatly agitates parents whose aims the Minister claimed he was interested in promoting.<br><br>
We think that the Minister might be able to come up with a better Bill. Grateful as I am to Conservative Members who have waited to vote in favour of the amendment, it might be helpful if I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
