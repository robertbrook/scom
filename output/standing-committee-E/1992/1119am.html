FUNDING AGENCY FOR SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'After the making of an Order by the Secretary of State'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>' .—(1) The Secretary of State may by order made by Statutory Instrument establish a body corporate to be known as the Schools Funding Council for England; and the Council shall exercise in relation to England such functions as may be conferred on it.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 7, in page 1, line 12, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) No statutory instrument containing an order under subsection (1) above shall be made unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 9, in page 1, line 11, leave out 'Funding Agency for Schools' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'Schools Funding Council for England'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are important because we are seeking to clarify the role of the funding agency for schools by exploring with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools why he has chosen the title of "Agency" rather than "council". We wish to ensure also that there will be further parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals, as we do not believe that the Minister can be trusted to get everything right about this matter.<br><br>
On Tuesday, much was said about the brevity of the consultation period, which has led to many difficulties for everyone, including Ministers. The more parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals that there can be, the better will be the chance that the provisions that are introduced will be practical and workable. They must not create more difficulties for everyone involved, including those schools in the grant-maintained sector.<br><br>
The need for further consideration and parliamentary scrutiny of the matter is made even greater by the fact that clause 1 is being debated in the absence of the consultation document from the Department for Education on the common funding formula. That document is expected to be ready before Christmas, when we shall be able to see the Minister's proposals. However, we must examine the clause today without that information. That makes the provision of proper safeguards and opportunities for future parliamentary scrutiny essential, because we do not know the details of the way in which the new system will work.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee a great deal more about the way in which the funding agency will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
work. The information on that so far has been very limited. The notes on clauses make it clear that that agency will not be a quango but that it will be free-standing and that it will have its own powers. However, there is nothing in the Bill that sets out clearly the funding agency's function. Therefore, our proposal that the body should be a funding council is a means by which we can explore why the Minister has chosen instead to establish an agency and what its role and powers will be. One of the new funding agency's tasks will be to distribute funds to grant-maintained schools. That is a cheque-book function. Ministers will lay down a formula to prescribe how funds are to be distributed to grant-maintained schools. Will the funding agency have much independent power and discretion, or will it simply form another bureaucratic layer to carry out the Secretary of State's intentions? Clause 1 does not specify the funding agency's powers. The authority will be a hived-off division of the Department for Education. The use of the word, "agency" should ring bells, because it often leads to privatisation. The Secretary of State will make decisions that that new funding authority will simply administer. That begs the question of who would wish to serve on such a body.<br><br>
If power is to be centralised and the funding agency is to have a bureaucratic and administrative role, serious problems will arise. In the past 24 hours, we have seen that the Secretary of State cannot even present statistical information that is of any value. If the Secretary of State cannot publish accurate information on examination results, how can he run every school in the country successfully?<br><br>
Centralisation in education will not work. Nothing in the clause persuades us that its provisions will do anything other than create a new bureaucratic organisation by which the Secretary of State can use his power. That raises important questions about the autonomy of the funding agency, and about its role. The Minister should clarify matters as quickly as possible. I hope that he will accept our reasonable request for another opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals in the absence of full information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments, which fall into two categories. Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 would mean that the creation of the funding agency would be subject to an order under the affirmative procedure. Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 would change "agency" to "council".<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 deal with accountability. We shall discuss that issue in more detail later when we consider other clauses and amendments.<br><br>
The Bill challenges the basis of local democratic control over an important public service. We must acknowledge that, whether in London, the metropolitan districts or the county councils, the provision of education is a major function of local authorities. It is an important part of our democratic process that such an essential public service should be under democratic, elected control. Many of us think that that is best achieved through local accountability.<br><br>
Under the Bill, that accountability and democratic control would not even be taken over by national Government, but would be pushed down to individual school governing bodies, by the strange concept of subsidiarity. That is superficially attractive, but the fact that a transitory group of parents should have control over
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0120">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
important public assets—literally billions of pounds of public money—is dangerous. It is far better that such money should be subject to elected, democratic control. A school belongs to the whole community, not just a small group of parents. To give power to one group of parents may be superficially attractive. It is similar to the argument that states that league tables are attractive; they may be attractive to a supporter of Newcastle United—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going wide of the subject of the amendment, which deals with the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the fact that Newcastle United is 12 points ahead in the first division is too tempting to ignore because it is so unusual.<br><br>
Education is an important public service and clause 1 would transfer the responsibility for education from local education authorities to a funding agency. Before that part of the Bill comes into force it must be subject to an affirmative resolution to allow further consideration of the important issues.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) said, we still do not know the full picture. It is like a jigsaw, certain pieces are in place, but we do not know about the most fundamental issue behind the operation of the funding agency and how it will allocate its slice of the cake to individual schools that may have achieved grant-maintained status.<br><br>
We are told that a consultation paper will come out sometime before Christmas, with consultation taking place into the new year. What concerns us is that that consultation may still be going on when the Bill reaches the statute book. Therefore, we think that an affirmative order would be appropriate.<br><br>
There are further dangers in giving the responsibility for such an important service as education to a funding agency. Education has developed in many positive ways over the years because, as a local service, it has responded to local needs and aspirations. The needs and aspirations of people in Wallsend will differ from those of Worcester, which we should acknowledge.<br><br>
The positive initiatives that have been taken in education over the years represent a response to local demands. For example, comprehensive education was not a decision made by central Government, but was decided by Conservative-controlled local authorities, Labour-controlled local authorities recognised the wisdom of that decision. It was wrong to condemn the majority of children aged 11 as failures and the authorities responded to the needs of local people.<br><br>
Provision for special needs has developed because of the way in which local education authorities were able to respond. Many organisations and many members of the Committee are worried that, in terms of special needs provision, a funding agency would not be in such a strong position to respond to local needs and aspirations. A local body has flexibility, but a central funding agency would impose a straitjacket of central control and the positive developments of many years might not continue.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
It is worth contrasting the Government's proposals with what is happening in other European education systems which, traditionally, have had a central funding agency exercising central control. France, Germany and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
Italy have centralised education systems but they are moving away from them because they know of the deficiencies and the rigidity that can occur. They are devolving power to locally elected democratic bodies. We are moving in the opposite direction and that is another example of the way in which the Government fail to learn from their mistakes and fail to appreciate the benefits and advantages of a decentralised education system, as recognised by other European countries. We are worried about the straitjacket of control that would result from a funding agency.<br><br>
The confusion over the financial arrangements under which the agency will operate also worries us. An affirmative order would allow us to consider the consultation documents that the Government are about to publish. One our our problems is the conflicting statements of the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary on Second Reading, which have caused even more confusion. During his opening speech, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I move on to grant-maintained school funding. The total resources available to the funding agency and grant-maintained schools will be determined annually by Government in the normal way."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, <i>c.</i> 634.]</p></blockquote>
No promise there of the additional resources needed for schools in the 64 LEAs which at present spend £524 million above their laid-down standard spending assessment for education.<br><br>
The following day, when winding up, the Under-Secretary stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"There can never be a level playing-field between grant-maintained schools and local education authority maintained schools, because grant-maintained status gives such clear benefits and advantages."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 November 1992; Vol 213, <i>c.</i> 836]</p></blockquote>
That of course begs the question of whether those benefits and advantages will be equivalent to finanacial costs going from year to year, or one-off costs to set up grant-maintained schools—even more confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is again going wide of the amendment, which is narrow and which relates to the name of the agency and the question of Parliamentary control. The other matters that he raises would be more relevant to a clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John, for that interesting information—[HON. MEMBERS: "It is a ruling."]—or perhaps I should say for that instructive instruction. The point that I was trying to make was that an affirmative order would allow us to know what the Government intend, and would clear up the confusion.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 propose changing the title of "agency" to "council". I spent an interesting hour in the Library last evening looking at Stevens and Borrie's "Mercantile Law", 17th edition, which took me back to my student days.
<br><blockquote><p>It is useful because it defines an "agent" as:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"he who is employed to do anything in the place of another".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It also says that one of the duties of an agent or an agency is to obey his "principal's instructions". How informative that is: we now know why the provision of an agency is so important. The funding agency will have to obey its principal—the Secretary of State for Education in England. The provisions for Wales allow the Principality to have a council, which is an interesting distinction.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be most instructive if the Minister replied to that point as soon as possible in the debate? He might even like to make a brief intervention now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the interesting aspects of the Committee is that we shall see the various pieces of the jigsaw being put in place. Clearly that piece will not be put in place now.<br><br>
I have given the legal definition of an agency. The Oxford English Dictionary defines an agency as:
<br><blockquote><p>"an establishment for the purpose of doing business for another—usually at a distance"—</p></blockquote>
that is quite informative—whereas a council is denned as:
<br><blockquote><p>"an assembly or meeting for consultation or advice".</p></blockquote>
That shows the stark contrast between an agency and a council. An agency does its masters' bidding—its master in this case being the Secretary of State—a council consults and reflects the views of the local community. An agency will not do that. It will mean further centralisation and put a straitjacket on the development of our education system. We need a funding council that reflects the educational needs and aspirations of the local community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the end of the sittings motion debate the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools referred to a remark that I had made in my speech, which is relevant to the clause. We discussed in some detail the Education Act 1944 which brought into being the LEAs as we know them today. The purpose of the clause is to undermine the role of LEAs. The Under-Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Members … for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) remembered with nostalgia the coalition Government of the 1940s. They seemed to think that the Committee could learn a lesson from that Administration. No wonder the hon. Members hark back to those days: coalition is probably the only way in which they will see the inside of Government in the foreseeable future."—</p></blockquote>
this is the pertinent point—
<br><blockquote><p>"I can understand their misty-eyed nostalgia, but a progressive, forward looking Conservative Government need not look to the 1940s for guidance on the conduct of business. We know what we want to do and we shall press on and do it."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 17 November 1992; <i>c.</i> 31.]</p></blockquote>
That encapsulates the arrogance of a Government who are not prepared to learn the lessons of history. That attitude misinterprets the point that we were making about the 1944 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This matter cannot possibly be relevant to the amendment. We must not go over the sittings motion debate again this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John, for the guidance.<br><br>
The Education Act 1944 set up LEAs. The clause undermines and seeks to destroy those LEAs. It is important to remember how that process came about and to learn lessons about consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman wants to widen the debate, the appropriate time to do so is on the clause stand part debate, not in the discussion of specific amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make progress and move on to the nature of the partnership between LEAs and central Government, which will disappear if the clause if passed unamended. We oppose the clause because it is a centralising one. It takes the provision of education away from local, democratic control and puts it under the direct
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
control of the Secretary of State for Education. The clause will have a centralising effect, which the amendments would rectify.<br><br>
The establishment of a funding agency for schools will be fragmentary because when the Bill receives royal assent, some funding authorities will be established almost immediately because, in some local education authorities, more than 10 per cent. of schools are grant maintained. The provision and control of education in England and Wales will be fragmentary: some schools will be under the control of the funding agency and others under the control of the LEA. That split will be divisive, as schools will be pitched against each other. The management of our education system will be chaotic, especially when the new system is bedded-in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend read the report in this morning's <i>Western Mail</i> that the longest-serving director of education in the Principality resigned yesterday because of his fears about fragmentation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) will not respond to that intervention, which was out of order, and that he will concentrate his remarks on the amendment rather than the clause as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had the impression that if I wished to amend the clause, I had to advance my reasons for doing so. The reason why we want to amend the clause is that, as drafted, it needs alteration. I seek your guidance, Sir John.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My guidance is that the hon. Gentleman must limit his remarks to the specific amendment before the Committee. We shall come later to the other amendments to clause 1 and have a fuller debate on clause stand part. The present debate is narrow and I should be obliged if the hon. Gentleman would concentrate on matters raised in the amendments that we are discussing now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 establishes the funding agency which, we are told, has specific powers, although they are not contained in the Bill. Those powers are relevant to the amendments.<br><br>
First, the funding agency has to produce sufficient primary and secondary school places within a specific area. That is currently in the control of the LEAs, under the terms of the Education Act 1944. Secondly, the funding agency will be empowered to distribute grants and to calculate recurring and capital grants to grant-maintained schools. Thirdly, it will determine whether grant-maintained schools under its direct control should be closed, enlarged or changed significantly in character.<br><br>
The funding agency will be appointed directly by the Secretary of State for Education. That is political patronage. My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury drew the Committee's attention to the danger of the democratic process if such a proposal were enacted.<br><br>
The establishment of a funding agency will bring to an end the coalition in the provision of education introduced in the Education Act 1944.<br><br>
There is no democratic mandate for clause 1, but it will not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny—a point that was made by my hon. Friends the Members for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor). If the amendments are accepted, any further move towards the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
establishment of a funding agency will be subject to ratification by both Houses of Parliament, making a democratic improvement to clause 1.<br><br>
The amendments would provide for the role of the funding agency to be prescribed by Parliament, not by the Secretary of State for Education. There will thus be further opportunity for consultation on clause 1 and on the operation of the funding agency, which will be subject to parliamentary control. Under the clause as drafted, the funding agency will not be accountable to Parliament, nor subject to public scrutiny or democratic control. That would be a bad day for the provision of education.<br><br>
Clause 1 does not make it clear what will happen to the subsidiary activities of the LEAs—nursery provision, post-16, non-advanced education, the educational psychology services and so on—when the funding agency takes over the role of the LEAs.<br><br>
I am also concerned about discretionary grants in the
youth service—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but he is going wide of the amendments. He can raise these matters, but not at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. I hope that you will guide me again, as this matter has been raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Dewsbury and for Wallsend, who asked about the specific funding arrangements for grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Will the Minister say whether the existing levels of funding for grant-maintained schools will apply to any school that applies for grant-maintained status in the future? In addition, I wish to inquire as to the funding of the funding agency. When the funding authorities take over the role of the LEAs, will they take over the existing education funding provided by LEAs in their areas, which could be either above or below SSA, or will the funding authorities have to spend at SSA levels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has explained some of the problems that will arise and which we shall highlight as we go through the Bill. Does he agree that the fundamental problem with the Bill is that it concentrates power in the hands of the Secretary of State, and that further parliamentary scrutiny must be ensured before the new organisation comes into operation, so that Parliament may exercise some control over the right hon. Gentleman's powers? Those powers are too vast for one person to control. That is the essence of our argument as to why there must be further parliamentary scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Clause 1, if it is left unamended, would place too much power in the hands of one person to control the funding agency and the provision of education throughout England and Wales. The essential element in the amendments that we are discussing is that there should be further parliamentary scrutiny. That would bridge the democratic deficit that would arise if clause 1 were left unamended.<br><br>
The amendments would render the funding agency subject to parliamentary approval and to parliamentary scrutiny of its membership and functions. In addition, the fact that an agency is proposed for England and a council for Wales is anomalous. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend missed an interesting point about the difference
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
between an agency and a council. The amendment would provide for real consultation in the future with interested parties and would preserve the partnership between LEAs and governing bodies.<br><br>
Finally, when the Education Act 1944 was passed, the then Secretary of State for Education, Rab Butler, promised the House that the Secretary of State would not become an educational dictator. Clause 1 would confer on the Secretary of State absolute power, which would be a retrograde step for the provision of education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a phrase that I suspect that the Minister may rue for many days to come, he described the Bill, at our previous sitting, as a "landmark piece of cake". Many hon. Members find that cake indigestible and unpalatable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was one of my rare and vain attempts to be humorous. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not repeat those attempts too often, or I shall give them up altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cake or otherwise, the funding agency is a major ingredient in the Bill. It is vital that we have a widespread debate on the amendments, because they probe the nature of that agency and try to ascertain the Government's intentions. The Government's thinking about the funding agency and how it will operate lacks clarity. We have already asked, why is it to be an agency rather than a council. What do Conservative Members believe to be the difference between the two?<br><br>
Many people are worried that the funding agency will have little independence. It seems to be a fig leaf for the Government. We all recognise that the clause is a centralising provision. It removes many powers from local, democratically accountable bodies. Its powers and functions are ill defined. The amendments reflect anxieties that are shared by the many organisations that responded to the White Paper.<br><br>
The London Boroughs Association said that the provision would lead to
<br><blockquote><p>"a marked loss of democratic accountability".</p></blockquote>
It described the funding agency as,
<br><blockquote><p>"a remote national body".</p></blockquote>
and stated that such a body would find it
<br><blockquote><p>"impossible to respond flexibly to local needs".</p></blockquote>
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities described the funding agency as,
<br><blockquote><p>"a streamlined body with all the powers of a local authority but stripped of democratic accountability".</p></blockquote>
The Association of County Councils said that it was,
<br><blockquote><p>"a creature of the Secretary of State … working under a general power of direction vested in him."</p></blockquote>
From what we understand of its purpose, the funding agency will be a puppet of the Secretary of State. That will worry many people, especially in view of the fiasco of the publication of examination results during the past 24 hours, which calls the Secretary of State's record into question.<br><br>
I oppose the concept and creation of the funding agency. However, if the amendments are defeated, we should try to ensure that the body has some independence, and that its functions are clear. It is another quango, set up by a Government who claimed in 1979 that they would have a drive to get rid of quangos and to get central government off people's backs.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
The Secretary of State proudly claims to be the key author of the White Paper. The White Paper states that the funding agency will have "closely prescribed duties". However, those duties are not closely prescribed in the Bill.<br><br>
I would not usually support granting powers to the Secretary of State through a statutory instrument, but I am so concerned about the lack of accountability in the Bill that I support moves to grant the powers through a statutory instrument. At least that would give us further opportunity to debate the issues. The change of name, which is also referred to in the amendment, may seem to many people to be pedantic. I do not believe that it is because it is important to study a name and its implications about a particular body. An "agency" refers to an executive arm of Government—a Department or part of a Department hived off for administrative convenience. A "council" refers to something rather different; it is more free-standing and has far greater authority and autonomy than would an agency. That is why I am in favour of the name change from "agency" to "council". As other hon. Members have already done, I must ask why there will be an agency for England, but a council for the Principality.<br><br>
There is much lacking within that part of the Bill and I hope that Conservative members will explain the powers and responsibilities of the funding agency so that we can get to grips with the Government's proposals. If the Government are successful in introducing the funding agency in the way in which it is described in the Bill, it will result in total chaos and division within the education service and it will do nothing to improve the quality of educational provision in our schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, for one, shall not attack, or be nasty to, the Government. Keeping strictly to the amendments, I shall use honeyed logic, which the Government will accept and, consequently, improve the Bill. I shall not pursue similes and describe the Minister as nutty as a fruitcake.<br><br>
In clause 1, we wish to change the phrase, "a body corporate"—there is a tautology, if ever we have heard one. The clause continues with the name, "a funding agency". That is a strange "Alice in Wonderland" scenario: a name is given and later that name is defined. That is like Alice who says, "My vocabulary means whatever I want it to mean".<br><br>
A funding agency can only mean one thing; it gives a certain intent, tone, style and lack of spirituality. It is, essentially, monetary materialism. We cannot let that phrase remain to guide our schools. We must first state the aims and spiritual purpose of our schools and then define what we want. Instead, the funding agency will be the controlling body—that cannot be right. As I understand it, a funding agency would merely deal with money matters, so that in future schools would be concerned only about money. That is wrong.<br><br>
I have considerable knowledge from my earliest youth of bookmaking agencies—otherwise known as bookies—where people place bets. The funding agency will be a similar body—people will put their bets on and they may get a return. There is no sign of the morality to which these bodies will be subject. It is a move away from democratic accountability.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The funding agency jeopardises efficient service delivery. The word "funding" implies paying out rather
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
than examining quality and objectives. If the Minister wants it to do that, he should change its name. We would be happy for the name to be changed to "council" because that gives people a better idea of what even the Minister, at the back of his mind, wants.<br><br>
I shall not go too deeply into the question of how, the funding agency will be constituted, but it is important to put down some markers. By calling it a funding agency, the Government are giving the public a signal about the sort of people they want to serve on the agencies. Will there be enough estate agents to go round now that they have all been placed on health authorities and other such quangos?<br><br>
The funding agency will carry out little strategic planning. It will be much like the shadow authorities for the police and fire services in the metropolitan districts. The funding agency will be removed from local democratic control and will not be properly accountable to Parliament. That is undesirable. I recommend to the Minister an excellent book by Steve Leach called
<br><blockquote><p>"Strategic land use/transportation—the post abolition experience".</p></blockquote>
It is well researched and clearly written; an evening spent reading that would put the Minister right on this matter.<br><br>
Calling it a central funding agency and hiding it behind cloaks and wraps will increase public confusion. It does not allow people to get at schools directly nor to plan schools. I ask for this verbal confusion to be removed by the adoption of the wording in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the arguments have been put eloquently by my hon. Friends. However, I should like to put one or two points on the record.<br><br>
The funding agency will be accountable only to the Secretary of State. The clause removes the influence of LEAs. The funding agency will be appointed by the Secretary of State who will annually review its budget and its staff. That represents an unacceptable degree of centralisation.<br><br>
The assumption behind the massive extension of the Secretary of State's Powers under the Bill is that only central Government can be trusted. I do not think that it would be out of order to examine the powers of the Secretary of State under the provisions to centralise our education system. Hon. Members have highlighted this aspect of the Bill, but they have not been specific about his powers. For example, he will appoint the chairman and the first chief executive of the school curriculum and assessment authority, and approve the appointment of subsequent chief executives. He will appoint the chairman, the members and the first chief executive of the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but he is going wide of the amendment. The matter of appointments is dealt with in a later batch of amendments and should not be discussed now. We are talking about the name, and about parliamentary accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Sir John, that is what I was talking about. I was trying to remind the Committee of some of the 44 centralising powers that the Secretary of State is taking. I wanted to highlight the centralisation that the Bill proposes. The funding agency is only one aspect. The Bill takes power from local education authorities and gives it to the Secretary of State. I was trying to prove
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
conclusively that the Bill is purely a centralisation measure that takes away democracy. However, I shall obviously take your guidance, Sir John, and come back to this later so as to put on record the number of new powers being taken. The Secretary of State himself told us of the extent of those powers in an answer to the Select Committee on Education. The list was long. It is terrifying to think of the power that he is taking.<br><br>
I have been active in education for almost the whole of my career. I have always believed that schools were a part of local communities and should be accountable to democratically elected local education authorities, but the appointment of a funding agency disproves that. The agency will take on a central role, local, democratically elected authorities will gradually lose their power, and education will be removed from the control of local people.<br><br>
The formation of the funding agency and the new funding arrangements give rise to a host of unanswered questions and will undermine most if not all local education authorities. Replacement of a national educational system that is administered locally and locally accountable by a fragmented system cannot fail to be a recipe for chaos. My colleagues share that view.<br><br>
If an agency is set up, we must be assured that its members will include parents and qualified teachers. We shall come to this later and no doubt the Minister will tell us how the agency will be composed. The agency will have to be made aware of the interrelationship between equality of opportunity and access and provision, including that for pupils with special educational needs. An agency will be undemocratic because it will not be administered locally. The Secretary of State's powers will be centralised. The only way to bring about some form of democracy and accountability other than through the Secretary of State and Parliament would be to accept our amendments. We must try to prevent the formation of an agency.<br><br>
There are many examples of agencies on the statute book. We need a body such as a council that is more democratic, and accountable to Parliament rather than to the Secretary of State. We shall debate these issues later. The Government should not take the amendments lightly; I hope that they will listen carefully to what we say this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unwittingly, and untypically, the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) put his finger on the spirit of the debate when he spoke about verbal confusion, of which there have been many examples this morning. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) said that there would be little for the agency to do; most of his hon. Friends said that it would be a grotesque centralisation. Opposition Members must make up their minds; it is difficult to reply to such contradictory accusations, but they put me in a strong position. Our deliberations are not helped if Members cannot co-ordinate their concerns and do not have a singleness of purpose.<br><br>
Under the amendment, the establishment of a funding agency for schools—a key issue—would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny after the Bill has been enacted, but it is this Committee that should scrutinise the proposal. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
is unacceptable to ask the Committee to approve a subsequent stage of deliberation, as the amendments propose.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the House gave us the remit to proceed with detailed consideration of the Bill, to which the establishment of a funding agency for schools is crucial. It should not be subject to further scrutiny by the House at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our scrutiny of the Bill is difficult because we do not have the whole picture. One problem is the common funding formula that will apply to grant-maintained schools: it raises many unanswered questions and creates confusion. I understand that the consultation paper and responses to it may not be available until after the Committee stage has been completed. Is the Minister saying that we will have the Government's response to that consultation in time for the Committee to scrutinise the common funding formula?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such interventions make me wish that I had not given way. However, I am in a generous mood so I shall reply to the hon. Gentleman. If Opposition Members had read the Bill they would know that the matter arises in clause 71, when we shall discuss the funding regime. Thanks to the tactics of the Opposition, I doubt that we shall reach that clause this side of next summer.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, my Department will issue a consultation document on the issue in December. It will form the basis for more deliberation on clause 71, but not on clause 1.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) may be surprised to know that, in some respects, I agree with his elegant analysis of the relative roles of agencies and councils. The agency proposed in clause 1 will have a statutory, independent existence. Its functions are clearly defined. For Opposition Members to claim that those functions are hazy suggests that they have not done their homework. The agency's statutory functions are set out clearly in clauses 7, 71 and 73 as well as in schedule 1. That means that there will be ample opportunity to study what the funding agency for schools will do and why it will be an agency rather than a council.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
One of the amendments would delay the establishment of the agency indefinitely, but the funding agency must be enshrined in clause 1 and must not be delayed by any procedural tactic because it will deal with the growing grant-maintained school sector. The Government are confident that there will be 500 grant-maintained schools by next April, and that that number will have grown to 1,500 by April 1994.I hope that Opposition Members are not suggesting that there should be no mechanism for dealing with the grant-maintained schools sector. If Opposition Members want to delay the establishment of the arms-length agency with statutory functions which the Bill sets out, I can conclude only that they are content to let my Department and officials deal directly with the growing grant-maintained sector. I and my officials are flattered by that suggestion, but Opposition Members may be surprised to hear that we do not consider that to be the best way to proceed. We believe that it would be better for that sector to be dealt with by a statutory body such as is described in the Bill and with the powers that are set out in later clauses.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister consider that the funding agency should be accountable to Parliament, or only to the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, the agency will be multi-accountable—to the Public Accounts Committee, to the Comptroller and Auditor General, as well as to the Secretary of State. The agency will be accountable in the variety of ways that one would normally expect of a public body of that sort. The hon. Gentleman should have no fears in that regard.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments because scrutiny is well covered by the proceedings of this Committee and by the remit given on Second Reading by the House. Further delay would damage the procedure set out in the Bill, which is that the growing grant-maintained school sector should be dealt with by an agency rather than by Government. That will be widely accepted in the world of education. An attempt to change the name would give the body the wrong flavour. We may debate the nature of agencies and councils later in our proceedings, but the concept of a council has connotations, such as were hinted at by the hon. Member for Bath, that do not and should not apply to the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments, which run counter to the intentions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's final point illustrates a glaring deficiency in the Government's approach. Speaking about the difference between an agency and a council, the Minister gave the definite impression that a council would not be up to the task of carrying out the functions set out in the Bill and that therefore the name "agency" was to be preferred. However, the Government differentiate between the bodies for England and Wales. England is to have an "agency", while Wales will have a "council". The notes on clause 1 state that the funding agency will be
<br><blockquote><p>"a statutory Non Departmental Body".</p></blockquote>
However, the notes on clause 2, which covers Wales, state simply that a funding council will be set up. They do not say that the funding council will be a statutory, non-Departmental public body. I assume that it will be, but the notes do not make that clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we get bogged down in comparisons, I hope that the hon. Member for Bridgend does not criticise our colleagues in Wales for choosing to tackle the Welsh funding authority differently. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office will cover that point when we consider clause 2. Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that there is nothing inherently wrong in approaching Wales differently, given its different background, traditions and culture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that. The Minister implied in his response that a council was somehow inferior to an agency. I wish to put on record that we in Wales are happy with the concept of a council. Amendments Nos. 1 and 7 would rename the authority that is to cover England, a council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Consultation and consensus will be sought in Wales; we should like that to happen in England. It appears that the funding agency will impose decisions on the English education system, whereas in Wales, the funding council will consult and seek consensus. What is good enough for Wales should be good enough for England.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a desirable point that we can explore in more detail later.<br><br>
Amendment No. 5 would ensure that the funding agency was set up by an order, which would require further debate. In his response, the Minister gave the wrong impression about the amendment's purpose. He said that the amendment was designed to prevent the establishment of the agency or council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Delay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister now claims that he said "delay". I should check the record, because I believe that the Minister hinted strongly that the Opposition did not want the agency to be set up. He said that he and his civil servants were flattered that we wished the Department for Education to continue to carry out the job assigned to the agency. That is not our purpose. If the amendment is accepted, there will be further debate and consultation and the agency might not be set up as quickly as the Government would like. That is self-evident. When the Government introduced reforms such as national curriculum, assessment and testing, they had to make a number of changes as a result of further consultation and responses and protests to the Department.<br><br>
Having debated the principle of a funding agency, it is right for us to establish a means whereby the agency will be set up. If it were created by order at a later stage, people interested in the effective and efficient administration of the grant-maintained arena would be able to comment on the elaboration of its role and its functions. Only 1·5 per cent. of the total number of state schools in England and Wales are now grant-maintained and the agency will operate in only a small percentage of LEAs. A delay of three or even six months is worthwhile for the sake of getting it right.<br><br>
The Minister referred to clause 71 and said that consultation on the common funding formula will give us a clearer idea of how the funding agency will proceed. We are prepared to seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment, mindful of what that consultation process might throw up. We will decide either that the matter is worthy of further consideration, or that the outcome of the consultation is satisfactory and that clause 71 should be amended accordingly.</span></p>
<p><i>beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 1, line 10, after 'established', insert
<br><blockquote><p>', after consultation with such organisations as represent persons and bodies with responsibilities under the Education Acts,'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the crucial and critical question of consultation. We want the Government to consult the bodies and people who have duties under the Education Act 1944. It is apparent from the debate on Second Reading and on the sittings motion and first group of amendments that the funding agency will bring about a fundamental change in the way in which the English and Welsh schools system is administered. There will be an entirely different focus for the funding of schools and the provision of school places. One of the responsibilities of the funding agency that the Minister missed was its responsibility under clause 8. If 75 per cent. of pupils in an area are at grant-maintained schools, or if the LEA has requested it, the funding agency will have the power to place a child in a specified school.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
11.45 am<br><br>
If the Bill were enacted, there would be fundamental changes to the way in which our education system would be administered. Therefore, the Government should take further advice from people and bodies with duties and responsibilities under the 1944 Act. I want to impress on the Committee and—I am sure that the Government will agree—that it would be another innovation. We can argue on another occasion whether it would be for better or for worse. It would have a major impact on the administration and financing of schools and on the provision of school places in England and Wales. It would affect all children entering the education system now and in the next couple of years.<br><br>
Why is consultation important? Children have only one childhood; they go through their infant and junior schools only once. They may be faced with a major innovation in their school's funding, so we should consult much more widely and take pains to get things right to ensure that their education does not suffer. It should be a Government priority to ensure that their proposed changes are achieved by a consensus of all the professionals involved. I hope that nobody would dispute that it is far better to get the best answers and system in the first place, rather than to have an idea, create the skeleton, put it into practice and then, when problems arise, attempt to put them right. While that happens, there could be damaging effects on the education of children if that were to happen.<br><br>
The technical and vocational education initiative has been applauded, and the principle was widely accepted at the beginning. Even the Department of Education would admit, however, that, over a few years, there were significant changes to the working of TVEI, which made it much better. How much more worth while and satisfactory it would have been if there had been wider and longer consultation on its introduction. It might have taken a year longer to bring in, but it would have been as efficient as possible from the start, rather than taking several years to arrive at the same point. Similar things happened in the introduction of the national curriculum, assessment and testing. Important changes were made shortly after their introduction, which, in some cases, led teachers to make changes mid-stream in their own approach to the content of the syllabus and the way in which it is assessed.<br><br>
Consultation with people and bodies with responsibilities under the 1944 Act would be worth while because it would save public money. I hate to think how much we might have saved if there had not been so many corrections and changes in thinking on the national curriculum and assessment and testing over the past few years—in other words, if we had got it more or less right at the beginning through consulting, and sought proper consensus with those directly involved in delivering education services.<br><br>
The Minister may throw up his hands and say that such consensus would have been impossible to find, but I think that the Government barely tried to find it. That is especially evident when one reads the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bonis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has twice referred to the 1944 Act. His amendment relates to education Acts. Will he clarify whether he means all the Acts? He seems to use as a reason for delay the fact that in the past, because of the experience with TVEI and other things, there has been a need for flexibility and a response
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
from the Government. That is correct. But he is not suggesting, is he, that that makes the Committees that considered those measures culpable? All hs is saying is that in practice there should be refinement, so the sooner there is implementation the sooner we can ascertain whether there are any rough edges that need to be ironed out. Is that not so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate why the hon. Gentleman wants to put that gloss on what the Bill does.<br><br>
I mentioned the 1944 Act specifically because, despite the 1988 Act, in a sense there is much in it that is fundamental to what is happening in education currently. I was thinking, however, of any person or body of people who have responsibilities under any of the education Acts relating to provision of education as outlined in the Bill.<br><br>
There are two views on how best to proceed to achieve the most efficient and effective system of education, and I have expressed one. It is an idea for change. The Government propose specific institutions through which they think that change will come about in a way that will result in an improved and more effective delivery of education. Their approach was expressed by the Minister in the sittings motion debate: we know what we want to do and we shall go ahead and do it.<br><br>
Comparisons of the volume of response to consultation on the White Paper on which the 1988 Act was based and that which underlines the Bill show a vast difference. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said that the 1988 White Paper received about 8,000 responses whereas response to the White Paper on which the Bill is based had a much shorter consultation time and elicited not many more than 800, fewer than 1,000 responses. Those figures show that it is worth while for the Government to allow greater consultation. The hon. Gentleman for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) said that there would be further opportunity for consultation while the Bill proceeded. His exact words were:
<br><blockquote><p>"the effective consultation period continues".—[<i>Official Report, 9</i> November 1992; Vol. 213, <i>c.</i> 644]</p></blockquote>
It appears that even Government Back Benchers recognise that further consultation is needed. The amendment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a meal of this. People knew about the Bill for some time. It is unwise of him to suggest that the proposals in the White Paper and the Bill were sprung upon folk; there was plenty of advance notice. Every member of the Committee has received representations from trades unions, from primary and secondary schools and from other interested bodies from AMMA to the Quakers. People have had every opportunity to make representations. The hon. Gentleman makes too much of the consultation issue. The opportunity was there and it is there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman ended his peroration by saying that the opportunity is there. We want to ensure that the opportunity remains. We are aiming our arrow at those bodies within education that the Government have a statutory duty to consult. We want the Bill to include the requirement to further consult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bills may be amended up to and including Report, which is still to come. They then make their passage through another place. The period of consultation is not the narrow searchlight that the hon. Gentleman suggests. There is great opportunity for continued discussion. I do not doubt that amendments will be

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
considered on Report, as the hon. Gentleman knows from his long experience on a previous Committee considering an education Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny what the hon. Gentleman says. However, there is a qualitative difference between what he is saying and what the amendment proposes in respect of the funding agency. There was a short consultation period when the White Paper was published but the hon. Gentleman cannot defend the length of the consultation period by saying that people knew about the White Paper before it was published and could therefore lodge responses to the Government's thinking. People could, of course, say to the Secretary of State, "We are worried about what you said in a speech to the chief education officers," but the Bill is predicated on a particular White Paper and we are talking about the responses to it. In considering the efficacy of those responses and how the Government are treating them, we found few "refinements" of the Bill, to quote the Government press release, as a result of consultation. The provisions of the White Paper, as embodied in the Bill, are being steamrollered through by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the problem with the consultation process is that only the people at the top of an organisation are able to give their reactions? For example, the Pope has not chosen to comment on the arrangements for voluntary aided schools, but the cardinals and bishops have. However, my own parish is very worried about what is happening. Although I have been reassuring about the reasonableness of Ministers, the people in my parish have seen the Secretary of State on television and believe that he is going to force them into a fait accompli. I have assured them that I shall defend them against the Secretary of State in this matter, but the fact that they need that reassurance shows that there has not been real, democratic consultation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a valid point. When a short consultation period takes place largely in the school holidays, it is often difficult for grass roots organisations such as those in my hon. Friend's parish to respond. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend will be able to bring the anxieties in his parish to the Committee's attention, and I look forward to hearing them.<br><br>
Consultation is important. Paragraph 11(1) of the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Children only have the chance of one school career".</p></blockquote>
That school career should not be wasted in the pursuit of policies that lack widespread support among people who are directly involved in the provision of services to children.<br><br>
The 1944 Act has been mentioned several times, and I do not apologise for mentioning it again. It illustrates a major and important difference between the approaches of Rab Butler, the Conservative Minister in 1944, and the present Secretary of State. The Minister was dismissive when the matter was raised in the debate on the sittings motion. He spoke of a nostalgia among Labour Members for the days when we were part of Government. The Minister implied that the present Government knew what they wanted to do, and that they would do it. However, he also implied that one cannot look too closely at what happened in the past because times have changed and things are different. That is true, but the Minister should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
listen to the Secretary of State, whose underlying philosophy of human relationships is based on an assumption that things are much the same for people now as they were in 1944, or 44 BC, or 1944 BC—in other words, that people down the ages have had a similar approach to their moral responsibilities, regardless of their personal historical circumstances. The Government would do well to take on board the lessons of the consultation that was undertaken for the 1944 Act. This has been the shortest consultation period for any major education measure ever. We have no need to apologise for attempting to include in the Bill measures that allow further consultation with bodies that have statutory responsibility for education provision.<br><br>
Some of the responses to the White Paper on the creation of a funding agency show how important it is for the consultation process to continue for a specified period. We are not asking for it to be stretched over years: three to six months would be suitable. Some very responsible bodies directly involved in the provision of education have been consulted. The Secondary Heads Association expressed
<br><blockquote><p>"Alarm at the implications for democracy of the White Paper, at the excessive additional powers proposed for the Secretary of State, at the continued attack on local democracy which the LEAs represent, at the creation of democratically non-accountable quangos, at the appointment of unrepresentative members to influential educational bodies, at the erosion of the influence of parents upon which the Parents' Charter is predicated and at the potential anarchy of the proposals for a SFA".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the consultation process is to allow a cooling off period to enable the Government to take soundings from the education world to avoid the anarchy that not just the SHA but many other bodies believe will happen if the proposals are implemented in their present form.<br><br>
The Conservative Education Association is headed by one of the Prime Minister's closest supporters, Demitri Coryton, who was actively involved in the election campaign—<i>[Laughter.]</i> For the benefit of the Committee I should point out that Conservative Members, even though they are discussing the Education Bill, obviously do not read the excellent journal <i>Education,</i> which contains a piece by Demitri Coryton. In his article, the chairman of the Conservative Education Association, a Conservative party activist in Sussex, described his work as he travelled round the country with the Prime Minister during the election campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must understand that that association, which has tacked the word "Conservative" on to its name, has nothing to do with the Conservative party. If I were to delay the Committee by trying to associate with the hon. Gentleman everyone who tacked the word "socialist" to their pronouncements, he would not be best pleased. Perhaps he is one of the few remaining in the Labour party who still regard themselves as socialists. The gentleman now being discussed by the hon. Gentleman is nothing to do with the Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That gentleman is also nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can do is to ask hon. Members to read the article in <i>Education.</i><br><br>
I return to the matter of consultation—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the matter of the status of the Conservative Education Association, is my hon. Friend aware that there was a reception last Wednesday evening—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled that the matter is nothing to do with the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was aware of that reception, but I shall not go into that matter now. I respect your desire that we keep to the amendment, Sir John.<br><br>
If we consider the consultation that has already taken place, the Conservative Education Association of which Mr. Demitri—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not out of order. The Conservative Education Association—Demitri Coryton is a member of the Conservative party—responded to the White Paper on the issue of the funding agency and the GM schools as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's present emphasis on GM schools, however, is something that we have grave doubts about … in effect, the Government is nationalising the schools of England and Wales … We believe that it represents a massive and dangerous increase in the power given to central government … All that will happen is the replacement of LEAs with a far larger, more bureaucratic and less accountable national education authority".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman goes further, this is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John. Given such a reaction at the first stage of consultation, it is important that the Bill should contain a right of consultation for those bodies that have a statutory responsibility for the provision of education services. I was trying to show that great disquiet has already been expressed about the creation of a funding agency. In such circumstances, it would be worth while for the Bill to include the right of such bodies to be consulted before the funding agency is set up.<br><br>
I hope, Sir John, that you will allow me to mention that effective providers of education, such as teachers who are members of the AMMA and the parents and teachers who are involved in the National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations, expressed their anxiety about what is happening. The Bill has not been amended as a result of those consultations and the concept of the funding agency remains.<br><br>
We must consider not only the issue of democratic accountability and the movement of responsibility away from LEAs to a nationally based funding agency but the important matter of the size of the administration and the bureaucracy that the funding agency will create.<br><br>
The NAS/UWT stated, succinctly, that the creation of a funding agency is
<br><blockquote><p>"the surest recipe for administrative chaos and bureaucratic obfuscation".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p>I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Martin. It is good to see you and we look forward to your fair and firm adjudication of the Committee's proceedings.</p>
<p>I shall not go into great detail about the bureaucracy that the funding agency could spawn, because other amendments deal with that. I shall concentrate on the consultation that has already taken place. The NUT, which represents many teachers, said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Funding Agencies replace locally accountable LEAs with an unwieldy and undemocratic administration which has a vested interest in extending the GM sector".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have fears for our children and their schooling during the period of shared responsibility for strategic planning between FA and LEA once the 10 per cent. GM level is reached. We can foresee only chaos".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>When that sort of response to the White Paper is elicited from organisations across the board, it strengthens the need for our amendment, which would require further consultation.</p>
<p>I shall quote two more sources. The Association of Heads of Grant Maintained Schools stressed:
<br><blockquote><p>"The total inconsistency between the powers proposed for the FAS in 4.7, 4.8 and the earlier assurances of the greater autonomy and accountability of schools".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The Church of England Board of Education said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We note that the Funding Agency will assume responsibilities for strategic planning but feel that the White Paper is somewhat light in indicating how this will work out in practice and, in particular, in explaining how the Funding Agency will relate to the other bodies that will be involved in this activity".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>That comment encapsulates why we have tabled an amendment that would bring about further consultation. The Bill describes a skeleton of a system, but gives it little flesh. We cannot look forward confidently to the way in which the system will work.</p>
<p>When the 10 per cent. threshold has been passed, and the funding agency has further responsibilities, that could cause problems for the circulars that the Department of Education has already issued and that contain guidance for schools in England and Wales. Circular 791 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the effective delivery of special education throughout an LEA depends upon a clear and coherent authority-wide policy. The policy must be made clear to the governing bodies and staff of schools and the other agencies with which the LEA is required to collaborate".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>I can tell you, Mr. Martin, from consultations that took place on the White Paper, that almost every organisation involved in the provision of special education is worried that the existence of the funding agency with its responsibilities and that of the LEA with its responsibilities will lead to confusion in the creation of a local authority-wide provision for children with special educational needs.</p>
<p>In some respects, the Bill would introduce several improvements in the provisions for children who are statemented—we hope that the provisions can be improved during the course of the Bill. There is a great deal of confusion and a likely diminution of service—to some extent that has already happened—for those children who are not statemented but who, nevertheless, need special support because they have learning difficulties. The Special Education Consortium has brought together many bodies concerned with special needs and has questioned how the funding agency, the LEA and the grant-maintained schools will operate in that area. It asks:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will grant maintained schools be required to play their part within such policies?"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The policies referred to are those of the LEAs in providing an all-embracing strategy for children with special educational needs.</p>
<p>Later in the Bill, clause 142 places responsibility on the LEA for children with special educational needs in its own schools and seems to exclude the grant-maintained
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
schools. It is extremely important that that issue is resolved through consultation, at this early stage. We want to ensure that such consultation is included in the Bill.</p>
<p>Will the funding agency require grant-maintained schools to cater for the provision of education suitable for children with those special rules? Will the funding agency have respect for the policies of the LEA in providing such educational needs when the agency carries out its own planning duties? If the LEA's special needs policy and the funding agency's plans are in direct conflict, how will that conflict be resolved? We need to ask those questions and the bodies that have responsibilities in those areas should have been consulted on how it can best be managed.</p>
<p>Let us take one practical example of what might happen, an example that the Special Education Consortium highlighted. Let us presume that an LEA works on the assumption that a school's hearing impaired unit cannot provide education for children who need sign language. The school may decide that it no longer wants to provide sign language and, instead, follows an auralist approach because it thinks that that is a better way of developing communication skills. There is nothing in the Bill to account for such a problem. Proper consultation, through the Bill, could be achieved with people and bodies with particular duties in the provision of education.</p>
<p>Circular 7/91—the current best practice guidelines for local authorities in schools—states that, in reference to their special needs policy, local authorities are required to show the arrangements for monitoring the performance of all schools and support services. Will the LEA be required to conduct the monitoring in grant-maintained schools as well? The Bill does not make it clear that they will be given that duty. Although the funding agency has a role in such arrangements through its duty to provide the area with information under clause 5(4), the duty on the LEA is not openly expressed in the Bill as far as I can see.</p>
<p>What will be Ofsted's role? Will it provide LEAs with relevant information to help develop a coherent, authority-wide plan for special education? The point of our amendment is that we think that the Bill, unfortunately, through its lack of clarity, still provides an opportunity for chaos, conflict and for recourse to the courts. The Government must take a positive attitude towards consultation. They must try to get it right by ensuring consensus, which would avoid children suffering because of piecemeal changes when the funding agency is established, and by admitting that they made a mistake. They should take steps to put matters right by undertaking ad hoc consultation to correct a problem should one suddenly appear. It would be possible, through extensive consultation, to resolve all the problems relating to the funding agency. The Education Act 1944 is an example of this.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In view of the chaos caused by yesterday's announcement of test results, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education has said that he intends to summon the Secretary of State to that Committee to answer the criticism and to explain what went wrong in Government. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Gentleman. I shall decide whether there is a point of order when I have heard him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I assure you that it is a relevant point of order. I understand that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
children who took the tests one year early are not included in the figures, that there has been much criticism of the raw data because it does not take account of other factors and that the Chairman of the Select Committee has said that he disagrees with the use of such statistics. In view of the fact that consultation on tests was ignored, regardless of the arguments made in the Committee stage of the relevant Bill, I propose that this Committee adjourn to allow further consultation about the Bill to take place so that no other cock-ups arise.<br><br>
Most importantly, I know that four members of that Select Committee—two from each side of the House—are sitting here this morning. I believe that the Select Committee may have to sit on Tuesday or Thursday to question the Secretary of State. Bearing in mind that other hon. Members may wish to hear the argument, and in view of the Minister's promise about flexibility when we debated the sittings motion, may I ask the Minister to say, on behalf of the Secretary of State, whether the Committee will be prepared not to meet—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is one of the longest points of order ever, and the matters raised are not for me. The proceedings of a Select Committee are nothing to do with me. This is a properly constituted Standing Committee of the House, so we must get on with the business.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must wait until I have answered the first point. In the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined I would not be prepared to accept a motion for the Adjournment of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Martin. Would it be in order for the Minister to guarantee that if that happens, he will keep his promise and allow the Committee to adjourn so that hon. Members can attend the Select Committee without missing the debate on this part of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, that is not a matter for the Chair. It is up to the hon. Gentleman to discuss that with the Minister—perhaps outside the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will not be prepared to adjourn the Committee. Some of us are involved in the work being done here because we regard this as a measure of considerable importance. We do not wish to go, we want to carry the task through and keep our hands to the task before us. Purely by coincidence, I have here a report from <i>The Times</i> entitled "The Great School Report".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman says that he does not want the Committee to be adjourned. If he had listened to what I said, he would know that I do not intend to adjourn the Committee. Let us get on with the business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given a ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a separate point of order, Mr. Martin. Apparently the Select Committee may be sitting at a similar time to the sitting of our Committee. If that happened, would you be prepared to adjourn the Standing Committee?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0130">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has passed a sittings motion. Hon. Members know the times of Committee sittings. I am sorry if hon. Members of the Select Committee have a problem regarding the times coinciding, but it has nothing to do with me. There is an amendment before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is not the same point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a different matter, Mr. Martin. I seek your advice on a later group of amendments to clause 1. The wording of amendment No. 38 at the beginning of that group is
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be unlawful for the Funding Agency for schools to do any act which constitutes racial discrimination."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the only way to define racial discrimination is through Acts of Parliament, which makes such acts illegal. Therefore, the amendment calls upon the funding agency not to do anything illegal, therefore there is, a tautology, therefore the amendment would seem not to be in order in debates on the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the amendments are selected by the Chairman of the Committee, therefore they are not for challenge; they are before the Committee for debate. We have not yet arrived at that group of amendments. Perhaps the appropriate time to comment or seek guidance would be when we reach it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Martin. Perhaps the Clerk will pass on my remarks to the then Chairman of the Committee because we do not want to spend time preparing to debate a group of amendments if they are to be ruled out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments are on the record. Let us leave it at that.<br><br>
There is an amendment before the Committee. Does anyone wish to speak to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Martin, to your first sitting in the Chair of this Committee. You have obviously had an exciting time with so many points of order so early on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found it difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If you found it difficult, may I say that I was rebuked at the start of my last contribution when I referred to the phrase that the Minister used "a landmark cake" and he told me that that was a joke. I am sure he was not joking when he told us that he was prepared to be flexible.<br><br>
I hope that on this amendment, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will be prepared to be flexible and to take careful note of what the hon. Member for Bridgend has said about the vital importance of consultation.<br><br>
The Secretary of State recently used an interesting phrase when he said that he was widely known for his reasonableness. Were he present today—and many Opposition Members wish that he were—I am sure that he would have listened carefully to the arguments about the need for consultation and may well have succumbed to them. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth referred to the consultation that had already taken place and to the large number of responses—about 1,000—to the White Paper. I hope that the Minister will respond to the request that I made at our previous sitting that he place
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
in the Library a list of all the respondents to the White Paper. Study of those responses occupied less than a month before the publication of the Bill. Very few changes were made between the publication of White Paper and the Bill, which implies that very little notice was taken of those responses.<br><br>
The evidence suggests, therefore, that even if there is more consultation, the Government will not listen. However, we can always live in the hope that, for once, they will listen, if the amendment is accepted and more consultation undertaken. Perhaps we will then find that thinking, consultation and planning will precede action. That is typical of the way in which Opposition Members would prefer to operate, but sadly the Government seem to want the opposite. The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) made it clear that he belongs to the other tendency, which acts first and thinks afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman insists on giving way, I must make it clear that a lot of evidence was received during the considerable consultation that took place in the long run-up to the Bill as well as from the constituency consultations in which I hope that the hon. Gentleman took part. I was responding to the suggestion that, even after all that consultation and scrutiny in Parliament and in this committee, the Government must be flexible enough to iron out any rough edges that may be found. I welcome that flexibility, but some of those rough edges can only be discovered when proposals have been put into practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who said that he hoped that I had been involved in consultation in my constituency about the White Paper. I hope that he will say the same to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who has said that it is wrong to attend meetings to discuss opting out and who has refused to attend a public meeting on the matter in his own constituency of Oxford, West and Abingdon.<br><br>
I want to pick up and expand on the point made by the hon. Member for Battersea, who admitted that the legislation has some rough edges: how right he is. They are very jagged edges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman ponder on two points raised by the intervention of the hon. Member for Battersea? First, it would be useful if Conservative Members were to give details of the consultations that they have had in their constituencies. For example, what public meetings did they attend and how did they respond to the concerns of their constituents? Secondly, it would be very helpful if we could be told which of the rough edges that the hon. Gentleman mentioned have been ironed out. I am not aware of any major changes to the Bill since the publication of the White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes two interesting points. I do not need to ponder on them; I entirely agree with him. I would just like to add that it is a good idea to ask Conservative Members to list the meetings that they have attended, but it would also be helpful if they made available to us the information that they gained from those meetings. That is why I am asking the Minister to make available in the Library a list of the respondents to the White Paper so that Opposition Members will be able to contact them and ask them whether they are willing to give us their views.<br><br>

The issue is clear: consultation is vital at all stages. Consultation before the funding agency is set up is important and consultation with those bodies with the most experience of the provision of education is most important of all. Consultation costs little, but it could save a great deal. We heard in the points of order about the huge mistakes made by the Government because of their lack of willingness to consult and to listen to the responses that they have had.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be flexible. He said that he is speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State, so I hope that he will be willing to listen, as the Secretary of State has claimed he will be. I hope that this vital amendment is accepted. If not, it will show the Government's attitude to talking to other people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am strongly in favour of pre-consultation because I am a socialist. It was suggested earlier that we should be ashamed of socialism. Socialism means joining together with people—<i>[Laughter.]</i> Conservative Members may scoff; they are trying to avoid allying themselves with local communities, and finding out what the people want rather than handing down decrees from on high. The Minister stands in front of the whole of the United Kingdom—sorry, not the whole of the United Kingdom, Mr. Martin; you will be delighted to know that Scotland is exempt from the provisions—he stands before the people of England and Wales and says, "This is our diktat". We shall have a quick response from those at the top. Some of us will read them and try to get rid of the rough edges but not very many because, if we really try, the hon. Member for Rugby amnd Kenilworth will say, "We're not going down that road. We must stay and work towards the glorious fulfilment of the Secretary of State's ideals".<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
That is not what we should be doing. We should be considering the consumers—the parents—and the people who pay for the schools and have an interest in them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman. I would be interested to hear the result of the election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, I cannot provide the hon. Gentleman with advice on that extremely important matter now but I hope to do so as the evening wears on. I am delighted to hear of the hon. Gentleman's somewhat belated conversion to the concept of parental power and responsibility. I assume that he will withdraw his powerful objection to grant-maintained schools. He knows that before a school achieves that status, it must hold a ballot on the subject. That is parental power in operation. Was the hon. Gentleman converted on his way to the Committee? Was he struck by a blinding shaft of light?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have rarely heard a better exposition of the philosophy of naive realism. It is before us, in all its starkness. If I were to talk about ballots in a particular way, I should be called to order. However, consultation is not merely a matter of balloting the parents. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth misunderstands the subtlety of education. For him, it is indoctrination. Education is essentially part of the local community and what counts is how it is worked into that community. That is an earnest of intent. If, later, the hon. Gentleman wants ballots to be held, he might consider holding them under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
the same rules as the Government's ballots for council house tenants. Scarcely a single school would opt out if that precedent were followed. It is only by rigging the ballots that the schools have been removed from their communities—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going rather wide of the amendment, which mentions consultation in relation to the establishment of the bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. I allowed myself to be led away from the paths of virtue by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.<br><br>
I resent being called a late convert to consultation. I have an excellent track record on the subject. I was in exile at the John Fisher school in Purley—dearly beloved Surrey—converting the heathen. I held a position of responsibility at St. Wilfrids in my beloved Yorkshire and was able to work through my philosophy—parents were consulted.<br><br>
Way back in what the Minister calls the trendy 60s, we were consulting parents and giving them information. We considered it important to consult them before we introduced new courses. I need no lessons from the honourable dictator on the Government Front Bench how to do such things. Consultation is important and the problem about the Bill is that no time has been allowed to do more than scratch the surface of consultation. All we ask is that the job is done properly. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has just expressed, in all its glory, the belief that the Conservative party is the party of consultation with the people. If that is so, the Government should accept the amendment. That would be an earnest of their good intent and would show that they believe, genuinely and absolutely, in consultation.<br><br>
Who should be consulted? I have already said that consultation should not be confined to the Pope. It should reach down to the ordinary parishioners who built the voluntary aided schools. Those schools exist as a result of those people's sacrifices. They are an integral part of the community because of those people's desire and philosophy. Our Catholicism and our reasons for being voluntary aided were not adopted to separate us from the community, but to make us part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should appreciate help and clarification from the hon. Gentleman. The wording of the amendment is:
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with such organisations as represent persons and bodies with responsibilities under the Education Acts".</p></blockquote>
That would not include parishioners, but would involve people at a higher level. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will clarify what he has in mind when he interprets the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astounded that the Minister should say that parishes are not representative. They are living units in the community, comprising parish priests, leaders of the laity—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise, Mr. Martin, I thought that my time had come to a halt, but I am delighted that I can continue to instruct the Minister about his duties.<br><br>
How far have the laity who are involved with voluntary aided schools been consulted? The Minister has no reply,

and it is clear that they have not been consulted. There was a quick word from the bishops, who made their opposition to the proposals for voluntary aided schools very clear. They were not consulted: they were told. There is a difference between dictation and consultation, and we should return to consultation. The dreadful funding agency that is to be set up would be made more sensitive if the real people were consulted. Consultation should reach as far as priests and parishes, but it should also include the teachers. Perhaps we could learn from the famous teaching orders, such as the Dominicans. They have a track record on education. They have made unfavourable noises about the Bill, but they should be consulted. The same is true of the Jesuits, who taught the Secretary of State. I asked a Jesuit friend of mine the other day why his order was so opposed to the Bill when it had trained the Secretary of State. His reply was, "We all have our failures."<br><br>
Teachers, too, should be consulted. I am familiar with all the teachers' organisations. I began in the National Union of Teachers, which I found insufficiently militant. I then joined the National Association of Schoolmasters but, after leading a couple of strikes in Surrey, I discovered that that union was anti-women, although that is no longer true. I could not be doing with such inequality, so I joined the only union that allows me to express my idiosyncratic views, the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association to which, I am delighted to say, I still belong. That union says that the Bill is anti-democratic and that it takes education away from the people. It claims that consultation should be thorough and not confined to a shifting population.<br><br>
Parishes and dioceses should be consulted as should teachers' organisations and all the broad organisations that are interested in education in their own areas. They know that education is the engine for change, movement and betterment, that education should not be fleeting, but for life. The Government have not consulted those organisations properly. I hope that the Government will not reject our proposal for the sake of some measly but hopeful words. I am sure that the Minister would have tabled those words if he had thought of them, but he is a busy fellow. I am sure that he will accept the amendment

gladly and thank the Opposition for our constructive and democratic proposals, and that he will also ensure that thorough consultation occurs no matter how long it takes or how much it costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my words of welcome to you, Mr. Martin, to those that my colleagues have already expressed. I look forward to hearing you exercise your excellent judgment.<br><br>
I make my remarks in the context of the shortest consultation period ever on any major education Bill. Consultation took place largely during school holidays. The Bill has come before the Committee with undue haste. After listening to Conservative Members, I have reached the sad conclusion that the Government do not wish to listen to what people say about this important subject. That is difficult to understand. The Bill has been discussed in Government circles, in Conservative education committees and associations. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is too much background noise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
However closely Conservative education committees, associations and Government circles have listened to each other's arguments, it is important that opinions from outside are considered. They should not simply be read and discarded, but noted and discussed with those who made those suggestions. They should be considered constructively.<br><br>
Amendment No. 8 is not a spoiling amendment. If it was, you would have rejected it, Mr. Martin. Teachers, LEAs, governors, the National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations and those who are involved with special needs education will wish to make important points about the operation of funding authorities. The structure of those authorities is important. I hope that the Minister would not be so foolish as to set up a funding authority that consisted of 10 or 12 accountants. Organisations that are interested in education will wish to comment on that.<br><br>
Such organisations will also have important points to make about the membership of funding authorities.</span></p>
