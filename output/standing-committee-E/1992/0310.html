	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PERMISSION BY NOTIFICATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [3 March]:</i> No. 1, in page 2, line 37, at the end to insert the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(d) the hedgerow is required to be maintained under the conditions set down in local acts of enclosure'.—	<i>[Mr Hardy.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering amendment No. 2, in clause 6, page 4, line 35, after 'hedgerow', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'other than a hedgerow required to be maintained under acts of enclosure'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall resume the speech that I started at our previous sitting. I trust that Conservative Members will not say that I have made a speech lasting more than a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not mind which of the amendments the Committee favours as long as Conservative Members have sympathy with one of them, or at least with some of my arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point that I was making last week is that the Bill makes no direct reference to enclosure hedgerows. It can be argued that without such reference it weakens the ancient and historic protection that hedgerows should enjoy. I hope that the Committee understands that thousands of miles of hedgerow are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested last week that because there are 4,000 separate Acts covering commons enclosure, there is vast diversity in the language of those Acts. At the beginning of the week I obtained a copy of an article by Mr Luke Clements in an ecological magazine. It referred to the common nature of a very large proportion of the enclosure Acts and the allotment clause, which often states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Plot [number …] shall be allotted to [name …] who shall make and forever thereafter maintain the hedges [detailing which] and the duty shall pass to his heirs and assign."</p></blockquote>
Many acts of Parliament confirming the enclosure of areas of common land in Britain contain the same terms, so the argument on excessive variety does not apply. In those days Parliament recognised that it was taking land from the community, giving it to a few landowners and farmers, and placing a specific and strict duty that they and anyone who succeeded them in the possession of that land should maintain the hedgerows for ever more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before, but it is worth repeating, that during the 30 or 40 years in which hedgerow destruction
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
proceeded apace in Britain—it is still proceeding—many enclosure hedgerows were destroyed by default. It will be interesting in due course to hear what the Parliamentary Commissioner says about a case that I presented to him a few days ago. Having observed the imagination which villainy often possesses in exploiting loopholes in legislation to conserve our natural and national heritage, I fear that the omission of a reference to enclosure hedgerows in the Bill will result in some judge or magistrate mistakenly or mischievously failing to take the matter seriously and allowing that omission to weaken the historic protection that enclosure legislation should afford. I do not mind which of the two amendments the hon. Member for Surrey East (Mr. Ainsworth) accepts. However, I firmly believe that, to ensure that no loophole or excuse for hedgerow destruction is created, one of the two amendments should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Late yesterday, I passed a copy of Mr Clements' article to the Minister, who perhaps not this morning but on Report, may offer the informed view of himself and his colleagues in the Department of the Environment. They cannot afford recklessly to ignore the legal provision that has been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I said that it was a pity that a test case has not been brought. I am sure that all members of the Committee will hope that the Bill reaches the statute book in reasonable condition, but once it does so the need for a test case will become even stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members often talk about the need to observe the rule of law, although occasionally some of them are prepared to accept commercial interests that do not. We should not enact one law that ignores another. Therefore, if the amendments are resisted, similar amendments will have to be pursued at a subsequent stage, but I hope that that will not be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was suggested that clause 18(3) meets the point that my hon. Friend is making. It provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that any work is permitted under this Act does not affect any prohibition or restriction imposed by or under any other enactment or by any agreement."</p></blockquote>
Why does not my Friend think that that provision meets his case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. I have already said that we must not create loopholes. My hon. Friend is aware that I was involved in the passage of the Badgers Act 1973. At that time, we thought that we had solved the problem. I said that villainy was imaginative—and barbarous and vicious villainy certainly is. Despite the provision of that Act, people still got off when they were prosecuted. We improved protection under the second private Member's Bill that I piloted, which became the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act 1975. However, villainy once again managed to get out and further loopholes were incorporated in that Act, which was consolidated in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We thought that that Act had closed the loopholes but once more the courts dismissed cases brought under it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) introduced a private Member's Bill to improve the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0993">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
law and close the loopholes which still existed in the 1981 Act. I was one of that Bill's sponsors. Loopholes were found in that Bill and it was not until two Acts which have been passed in the past couple of years—one to protect badgers further and one to protect badgers' sets—that we could claim to have closed the loophole. I am anxious that we do not try to get conservation measures on the statute book and feel virtuous and satisfied by them until we have dotted every "i" and crossed every "t" and, if necessary, dotted them twice and crossed them twice to ensure that our natural heritage is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the courts would take the view that my hon. Friend would hope they would take. However, in order that we can be sure, it is essential to refer to the enclosure legislation so that there can be no doubt. I speak as a layman with considerable experience in the protection of our countryside. My anxiety is that some clever lawyer, in defending a villain—it would be villainy—might say that because the Committee did not include a direct reference to those ancient hedgerows, which are already, supposedly, protected, the protection would be diminished. I do not believe that Conservative Members want that to happen, even if they are reluctant to change the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my basic argument and I trust that the Committee will respect my remarks. I do not want to imperil the Bill at a subsequent stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to dwell at length on what the hon. Gentleman said. I said last week that all members of the Committee hold his expertise on this subject in high esteem. I reiterate my welcome of his interest in this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must advise the Committee that the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman are not relevant or necessary to the Bill, whose provisions afford additional protection to enclosure hedges. I hope that he will welcome that and will bear in mind the wider implications of his intention to return to this matter at a later stage. I urge the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to be clear that the assurances we have been given will hold and that my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) will not find that there is a loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that any work is permitted under this Act does not affect any prohibition or restriction imposed by or under any other enactment or by any agreement."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend said that, under the enclosure Acts, there is a positive duty to preserve hedgerows, but the Bill seems to refer only to a prohibition or restriction and imposes no positive duty. Is that a loophole? Is the hon. Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Ainsworth) satisfied that any positive duty which exists under the enclosure Acts is maintained by the two words, "prohibition" and "restriction"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am indeed satisfied on that point. If the Bill does not specifically address the enclosure Acts, as I freely admit does not, it is because they are not relevant to the purposes of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14 in page 3, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) When determining an appeal under subsection (4) above, the Secretary of State shall take into account any proposals by the person who served notice under section 2(2)(a) above to establish a hedgerow or hedgerows and any planting of a hedgerow or hedgerows by that person within the period of five years ending with the day on which notice is served under section 2(2)(a) above.'.</p></blockquote>
One of the shortcomings of the Bill is that in many respects it is negative because it would place a series of prohibitions on farmers and landowners. We have discovered that in all matters to do with the countryside such legislation should encourage give and take. Amendment No. 14 is important because we want farmers and landowners to take a responsible attitude towards conservation. We want to encourage them to become involved in new planting of hedgerows and woodland. The amendment would place a duty on the Secretary of State, when he is considering an appeal, to take into consideration the track record of what new planting or other measures a farmer or landowner may have done to enhance the landscape of a farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment extends that provision so that the Secretary of State would be able to consider what the farmer or landowner intends to do in the next five years. A farmer might have a conservation strategy and a farm management strategy which went hand in hand. In order to realign fields, a hedgerow might need to be removed. If that is included in a rolling programme of replanting—which has been carried out by many farmers recently—the farmer should get credit for that. If the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is a genuine plan for future years and that there is positive evidence of an intention to improve the landscape, which could be determined by grant applications, he should take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the provisions in the amendment will encourage fanners and landowners to take a positive attitude towards conservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) thinks that aspects of the Bill are negative. I regard the Bill as positive, as do the many thousands of people up and down the country who believe that it will provide an overdue set of measures to protect Britain's most valuable hedgerows. I reassure my hon. Friend that the Bill is not intended to be negative. Indeed, I hope that I can further reassure him that there is every intention to enable give and take during the debate and in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 14 would put a duty on my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, when determining an appeal against a local authority's decision, to take into account any proposal to establish hedgerows and any planting of hedgerows carried out in the five years leading up to notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will recall that we discussed that issue last week when we considered an amendment to
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
clause 2, which would have required local authorities to take account of those factors. I must reiterate the points that I put to the Committee then First, that part of the amendment dealing with a proposal to plant hedgerows is unworkable, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has no power to enforce a promise to replant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as I hope I made clear last week, a local authority's evaluation of a hedgerow will need to be made in the context of other hedgerows that contribute to the surroundings. It follows that the hedgrow's value as a wildlife habitat or its contribution to the landscape will be affected by the existence of surrounding hedgerows. It is, therefore, logical to conclude that if a landowner is active in planting new hedgerows, he is creating circumstances in which it is less likely that he will be prevented from removing a hedgerow because of its landscape or wildlife value. Last week, my hon. Friend the Minister reitrated that point and emphasised that his Department's guidance to local authorities would make clear the need for them to take into account the existence of surrounding hedgerows. Since my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State will, on appeal, reconsider the judgements made by a local authority, it follows that he will also consider the existence of other hedgerows, whether planted by the applicant or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the need to encourage the planting of new hedgerows, and to continue to do so. I certainly do not wish my Bill to be seen as discouraging new planting, but I fear it just does not make sense to build in a general consideration of good environmental practice when what is at issue is whether or not a particular hedgerow is worthy of retention. However, I hope that I have reassured members of the Committee that the measures in the Bill are able to take account of planting in a manner which is entirely consistent with the Bill's overriding aim—to ensure that if a hedgerow is of value, it can be retained. I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I think his Bill is extremely positive. That amendment is important. It amends clause 4, which deals with appeals. It is one of the most important parts of the Bill because it provides the final recourse for the owner of a hedgerow who wishes to remove a hedgerow. I remind the Committee that clause 4(4) states that the Secretary of State "may"—take certain factors into account—not that he must; he "may". As soon as forestry was taken out of the tax net, planting in the United Kingdom declined. In parallel with that argument, I am anxious that there should be no disincentive to plant new hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to see new hedgerows. There is a net gain in the number of hedges that I have planted. I have one of the highest ratios of hedges in Norfolk—indeed, in East AngUa—because of the retention of hedgerows. I am not one of those people who, during the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s, ripped cut hedgerows. It would be folly to discourage the many responsible farmers and landowners in this country from planting new hedges. Their record should be taken into account. I accept the assurance of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East about those hedges that have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0995">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
historical, landscape or other values. But, if the owner of a hedgerow has gone so far as to appeal to my right hon. and learned Friend then Secretary of State, it probably means that he believes that he has a very good reason to remove the hedgerow. That is one of the factors that the Secretary of State "may" take into account. I urge the Committee to consider the amendment seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this is an important part of the Bill. I should like to take this opportunity to say how much I respect and admire my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) for the immense amount of work that he has undertaken to preserve his patch of the British countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no intention to prevent people from planting hedgerows, and that will not be an effect of the Bill. A landowner's record of looking after the countryside for which he is responsible will be taken into account under the Bill. I again urge my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still hope that the Committee will support the amendment. I do not agree with my hon. Friend that the track record and plans of fanners are properly reflected in the provisions of the Bill, which is why I think that the amendment is essential. I hope that the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee does not support the amendment, a bad signal will be sent to the agricultural community. A farmer's track record and plans is only one factor that the Secretary of State may take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps stressing the word "may", which is in the clause. Amendment No. 14 says that the Secretary of State "shall take into account any proposals" or any work done in the previous five years. The bureaucracy would be monumental.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4(5) has provoked considerable controversy and a great deal of thought. As members of the Committee are by now aware, the Bill aims to provide controls on hedgerow removal so that the most valuable examples may be retained in the public good. To expect individual farmers or landowners to bear the costs of this in the interests of the wider public good is not a new concept. For farmers in particular, it can be argued that the high level of agricultural subsidy paid from the public purse entitles the public to some protection of the environment in return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill recognises that there may be circumstances in which the cost to the individual concerned may be so great that it outweighs the value of the hedgerow to society. Clearly it is a difficult balancing act. The decision we are left with is how best to achieve this balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the Bill is to encourage landowners to examine hard ways of operating their businesses which make use of the land without removing valuable hedgerows. That contrasts to the present situation in which hedgerow removal may be the first and most obvious measure contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the system to be fair, but it would not be consistent with the aims of the Bill or with general good practice to create a situation in which almost every case of refused hedgerow notification could plausibly go to appeal
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
because some economic consequence could be shown. Clearly, there will be an economic case of some sort for most hedgerow removals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a local authority's decision to refuse a notification leads to an appeal, clause 4(5) empowers the Secretary of State to allow the appeal if he is satisfied that the proposed work is necessary to secure the viability of the business. That test has been regarded as too severe, as it would effectively prevent almost any appeal from being successful. That is certainly not the intention of the Bill, so I have reconsidered the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 38 provides that an appeal may be allowed if
	<br><blockquote><p>"any business … would be seriously impaired if the work in question were not carried out".</p></blockquote>
I shall set out briefly why I prefer that test to the measures in the other amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Cornwall and by my hon. Friend's the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 suggests that an appeal should be allowed where
	<br><blockquote><p>"retention of the hedgerow … would pose a significant threat to"</p></blockquote>
the viability of any business. I accept that that is a less severe test than that contained in the Bill, because there would no longer be a requirement to show that it was necessary for the work to go ahead in order to secure the viability of the business—only a threat to viability would need to be demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 66 and 16 weaken the test to an unacceptable level. Amendment No. 66 does so by including two additional criteria: that the work is necessary
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of good husbandry"</p></blockquote>
of the land, or
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of the sound management of the land". Expressions such as "good husbandry" and "sound management" have an appealing resonance, but those criteria are so wide that they could probably be applied to justify almost any case of hedgerow removal. For example, it could be argued that the removal of all hedges was in the interests of the good husbandry of oilseed rape or wheat.</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 16 substitutes the concept of viability with a test based on efficiency, by providing that an appeal could be allowed if it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"prevent the efficiency of any business … from being substantially impaired".</p></blockquote>
"Efficiency" is capable of wide interpretation—so wide that the amendment would create the risk that a vast majority of cases of refused hedgerow notifications would go to appeal, at the taxpayer's expense. Efficiency implies a ratio of output to input, which can be measured in many different ways. For example, in recent years farming has become highly efficient in terms of labour, but that has been possible only because of the increased use of machinery. In terms of fossil fuel use and the cost of unemployment, the efficiency of agriculture presents a very different picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0997">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
Environmental economists have argued for many years that efficiency calculations that do not include an assessment of environmental impact give a distorted picture. It is relatively easy to be efficient if the cost to the environment is ignored. The concept of efficiency, therefore, is insufficiently clear to appear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 38 attempts to convey the intention that successful appeals should be restricted to cases where the business would be seriously impaired, without unduly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes good sense if the land is in agricultural use. However, it is not clear from the clause or the amendment how other, subsequent uses of the land would be affected. The hedgerows would be protected by the Bill, but if a developer bought the land and obtained planning permission, could he justify overriding the planning committee's views and any conditions that may have been attached to planning consent requiring hedgerows to be retained? Could he appeal successfully to the Secretary of State to have that overturned, on the grounds that such conditions might carbe through the profits that might be made frorn the development of the estate to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the point that my hon. Friend makes and I shall give consideration to that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to sit down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, amendment No. 38 addresses the concerns properly raised, without unduly restricting the test of an assessment of the entire viability of a business. I accept that in its original form that test was unduly onerous. I believe that the amendment presents a fair compromise. I urge hon. Members to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is perhaps a feeling among my hon. Friend's that the amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham are time wasting and frivolous. I assure the Committee that that is not the case. My hon. Friend and I have spent many hours trawling through the Bill to make it fair and. more workable. We do not wish to waste the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to clarify the point raised by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr Bowis). It may be covered under clause 16, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 shall have effect as if this Act were included in Chapter I of part VIII of that Act".</p></blockquote>
The following subsections would cover subsequent development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to clause 4 are important. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East recognised their import by tabling his own amendment, which comes part of the way towards our original amendments. The Bill would impose an almost impossible test on securing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
viability of a business. Subsection (5) provides that the Secretary of State may allow an appeal only if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is satisfied that it is necessary for the work in question to be carried out in order to secure the viability of any business".</p></blockquote>
To secure the viability of a business means that the business must almost be threatened with bankruptcy before that test can be passed. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East recognised the strength of our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth exploring that matter a little further. We have tabled amendments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he supports the broad thrust of the Bill, which is to preserve hedgerows, it is not a question of whether keeping a hedgerow will help a business prosper. The test should be whether to keep something that is historically important, valuable or precious and whether the Secretary of State would overrule an order that something should be kept only if the viability of a business would otherwise be endangered. The hon. Gentleman is speaking as if the only test is whether preserving a hedgerow has a value for a business, or whether it would be more profitable to get rid of it. The onus of the Bill is the other way round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. We want the Secretary of State to have a sensible basis on which to make his decision. A test of whether a business might fail is an impossible hurdle. If it is to be included in the Bill, it should at least be workable, sensible and, above all, fair to the owners of the hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East spoke about the efficiency of agriculture, which has undergone a sea change since most hedges were planted. Many hedges have been removed since the war to achieve that efficiency. It is unrealistic to expect hedges of historic or landscape value to be preserved in aspic for all time—all hedges in all places for ever. No one with a sense of fairness who wants agriculture to succeed would say that. We want a Bill that is workable and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the owners of hedgerows—the farmers who work the land—who will have to live with the Bill. Whether we like it or not, maintenance of hedgerows is a considerable expense to farmers. I accept that it is more mechanised than it used to be, but it still costs a great deal. I commend our amendments to the Committee, especially amendment No. 16, which refers to the efficiency of business. The introduction of the term "efficiency" would still leave intact the words "substantially impaired"; thus, an important test would still have to be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 66 would introduce two concepts that have been well tried and tested by both the Lands Tribunal and the courts under more or less all previous Agricultural Holdings Acts from 1948 to 1986. The concepts are well understood by the agricultural community. The amendment comprises three parts. It refers first to securing the viability of a business. Provided that the other two criteria under the amendment are taken into account,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0998">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and I would be happy to leave the present reference in the clause to securing the viability of a business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment deals with "good husbandry". We are concerned primarily with that; it means maintaining the hedges where they should be maintained. As I have said, circumstances may arise when it is desirable, for several reasons, to remove hedges. Good husbandry would be a worthwhile test and it should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third part of the amendment refers to "sound management". We are asking our farmers to become more professional in the way in which they manage the land and to become, above all, more competitive. We want them to succeed, to try to reduce the £5.5 billion deficit in the food and drink sector. Every day, we are exposing farmers to the marketplace by reducing protectionism at all stages. Given that we are asking farmers to be in a sound and open, but highly commercial and competitive world, they should be treated fairly. The tests of good husbandry and sound management are two tests that the Committee may wish to consider. Furthermore, the reference to the efficiency of the business under amendment No. 16 is an especially good concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recognise that amendment No. 37 is an option to those provisions introduced by the hon. Member for Surrey, East and the hon. Gentlemen who represent the country landowner's cavalry. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is right. We must have legislation that is workable and fair, but it must be clear. My amendment would produce greater clarity than would be produced by the other proposals in relation to the grounds of appeal. I accept that the Secretary of State may take into account certain considerations; nevertheless, for the sake of all the parties to the process, it is important to have as much clarity as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live deep in the heart of the Cornish countryside and I am surrounded by all sorts of hedges. It is not surprising that whenever I meet my neighbours, as I did late on Saturday evening, I am bombarded with questions about the great debate on the future of the British hedgerow. It is clear from the discussions that went on late on Saturday night that, above all, my farming neighbours want clarity. As I am on the wagon for Lent—at least, on all days other than Sundays—the Committee will appreciate that my motives were mixed in trying to maintain that discussion beyond midnight. However, there was no difficulty in so doing because the issue causes great concern. Amendment No. 37 meets precisely the requirements of many farming and environmental organisations, which want a clear definition for the Secretary of State to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the excellent notes on the Bill produced by the Council for the Protection of Rural England. That is not a dangerously radical or revolutionary organisation, but it tries to balance the interests of farmers and of those who visit and enjoy the countryside. Its brief states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Widening the grounds of appeal to take into account questions of efficiency of farm businesses would risk discrediting the legislation by giving too wide a ground for appeal. In many instances removing a
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
hedge might affect the efficiency of the business but would not be significant for the 'viability' of the business. Therefore, if 'efficiency' is introduced as a ground for appeal it seems likely that decisions on registration would go to appeal in too many instances."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the hon. Member for Surrey, East shares that concern. We do not want the Bill to be still-born before it can be put to effective use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 would strike a balance between legitimate farming considerations and the concerns of those of us who want to protect the environmentally important hedgerows. We want to have a workable Bill but, as it stands, the Secretary of State can override environmental considerations and allow an appeal if he believes that the removal of a hedge is necessary to secure the viability of a business. That is a strong test, but we believe that it might cause confusion in many instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why my amendment would return to the original wording that I believe was used when the Bill was foreshadowed by the then Minister of State, the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), in July 1991 when he announced the Government's proposals for hedgerow notification. Those proposals were followed by a long period of discussion when the Department of the Environment consulted widely, for which it is to be congratulated. However, "a significant threat to" the viability of a business, the phrase used in my amendment, is less stringent than the words, "secure the viability", but it recognises the potential conflict of interest that would otherwise occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large cross-section of the agricultural community supports the amendment, which I believe would be strong enough to ensure that the measures of workable. I also believe that the amendment provides the best option for the Committee, which I hope will support it. I especially hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will recognise that it was tabled not, in a spirit of carping criticism but to support the general purpose of his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and myself and to comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East when introducing his amendment. Amendment No. 38 comes some way towards meeting our aims but I was concerned about some of the comments that were made and I hope that I have not misinterpreted them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to point out that, despite the Bill, the future of English hedgerows remains in the hands of farmers because they are responsible for maintaining them, although they are under no obligation to do so. If they think that the Bill is onerous, that it will interfere with their business or that it is merely unclear and bureaucratic, they will cease to maintain hedgerows—maintaining hedgerows involves considerable cost, putting a flail over a hedgerow. If farmers cease to maintain hedgerows, they will begin to die, so I reiterate that unless the measure has the support of farmers, the future of hedgerows will the threatened. We should bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for Hexham and the hon. Member for North Cornwall and I am in broad agreement with almost everything that I heard. The word "balance" was used so frequently in the debate that the double act of my two hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham seemed likely to turn members of the Committee into a trapeze group. However, there are clear differences of view on what constitutes appropriate balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to persuade the Committee that my amendment would strike the right balance. I fear that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, which would retain the word "viability", does not tackle the issue that I have been at pains to resolve—to ensure that the burden placed on the farming community is kept to an absolute minimum. On the other hand, I fear that the case made by my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham in favour of their amendments does not address the point which I made in introducing my amendment. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for North Cornwall not to press their amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, asked what would happen if land that had been formerly in agricultural use came into development use and how the Bill would apply in those circumstances. Once the land had been taken out of agricultural use and put into development, the provisions of the Bill would no longer apply, although some protection would continue to be afforded to hedgerows by planning conditions. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury referred to appeal provisions in the Bill, which would not apply, but there is an appeal procedure under part III of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.1 hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concern is that there can be an obligation to reinstate trees and shrubs which are diseased. Amendment 118 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"uprooting or otherwise destroying, or significantly impairing the quality of, a stretch of hedgerow which contains diseased shrubs or trees for the purpose only of protecting from disease any crops growing on adjacent land."</p></blockquote>
We are anxious to ensure that it is possible to remove hedges in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that under the Bill a farmer must notify the local authority, which must then respond within 28 days. If a farmer or landowner removed a diseased hedge, he would subsequently have to prove to the court that it was diseased. It would, therefore, be prudent for him to obtain evidence that it was diseased before removing it. I urge the Committee to consider amendment No. 118.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there was a noxious disease—for example, rhizomania—in the hedge—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman had said that if the hon. Member for Surrey, East was prepared to move his amendments, he would be prepared to withdraw amendment No. 68.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I am worried that if there was a serious disease in a hedge which could affect the adjoining crop, the farmer would not be able to remove that hedge. It would be for the owner of the hedge to prove conclusively to the court that its removal was necessary. No loophole is intended and amendment No. 68 would simply require the owner of the hedge to prove conclusively to the court that it was necessary to remove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to the need to allow farmers to remove stretches of hedgerow that harbour diseases or pests detrimental to agricultural production on adjacent land. They are symptomatic of the valuable contribution to the Bill of hon. Members who have farming interests and organisations such as the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union. I welcomed my consultations with them and their input to the Bill is likely to be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 68, 69 and 117 would allow farmers to remove a stretch of hedgerow where it was necessary to control plant or animal species detrimental to the agricultural use of the adjacent land. There would be no requirement to notify the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 69 refers to "permanently impairing". We have already discussed the use of "permanent" and rejected it as inappropriate in the context of the Bill. On those grounds alone. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of this group of amendments is admirable. There should be an exemption to allow farmers to remove a hedgerow that harbours disease—for example, fire-blight and plumpo—and threatens adjacent crops. But in including references to animals, the amendments are drawn too widely. They would allow farmers to destroy a hedgerow on the grounds that it was harbouring rabbits or that crows or magpies were using it as a perch. I do not believe that, in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to allow hedgerow removal without prior notification. That is why I have tabled amendment No. 118, which would allow farmers to remove any stretch of hedgerow which contains a disease that might damage crops in adjacent fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give farmers the freedom to take the action necessary to protect their crops from disease. However, it will not provide a loophole to enable farmers to remove hedges that harbour wildlife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reasured my hon. Friend's the Members for Hexham and for Cirencester and
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
Tewkesbury sufficiently for them to withdraw their amendments in favour of amendment No. 118. Amendments Nos 41 and 42 relate to clause 7 and are consequential to amendment No. 118. They create a duty to replace any stretch of diseased hedgerow removed with hedgerow of similar quality. The amendments would bring the removal of diseased hedgerows in line with other permitted removals set out in clause 5. In cases where a farmer or landowner had removed a stretch of diseased hedgerow, the replacement of those shrubs would be consistent with good hedgerow management. Without a duty to replace such hedges, farmers and landowners might be encouraged to exploit a potential loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to probe my hon. Friend's intention in this matter. Does he mean that, in every case where a fanner or owner of a hedge removes a diseased tree or shrub, he should be required to reinstate it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am not I right in thinking that clause 7 requires that in any case? When a hedgerow is impaired—I would have thought that includes a diseased one—there is a requirement on the owner of the land to reinstate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was that an intervention or was the hon. Gentleman contributing to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be helpful if I said that the analysis of my hon. Friend the Member for Batterseas is correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East did not respond to my invitation to clarify this matter. May I suggest to him that if I am correct about clauses 5 and 7, as drafted the Bill provides no incentive for the owner of a hedge to remove dead or diseased shrubs? Imagine a hedge with a line of dead elms, in coppice or tree form. Under the Bill's provisions, if the owner removed the elms he would have to reinstate them but if he did nothing and allowed them to rot and cause an ugly eyesore on the landscape, nothing under the scope of the Bill could be done about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is unnecessary confusion about this matter. When the Bill refers to "impairing the quality" it does not apply to an act of God or nature which causes the hedge to become old or diseased. In such a case the owner would not be under an obligation to restore it. By impairment of quality, we mean as a result of an act carried out by a person. I refer my hon. Friend to clause 1(b). It states that a person is guilty of an offence if he
	<br><blockquote><p>"does anything, or causes or permits another to do anything, whereby the quality of any hedgerow is impaired''.</p></blockquote>
In such circumstances section 7 would apply. The impairment we are referring to is where someone does something physically to ruin or impair the quality of a hedgerow. In such a case that person is under obligation to restore it. Although quality may appear impaired when hedgerow had died naturally of some disease, that does not mean that the owner is obliged to restore it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This interesting amendment demonstrates how clever lawyers get involved in drafting a Bill and use words that do not mean what they say. Clause 6, which deals with unprotected hedgerows, is important. Subsection (1)(b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at one end of the hedgerow the continuity is broken otherwise than by".</p></blockquote>
If members of the Committee read that carefully, they will realise that it could mean two things—that the small part of the hedgerow would be protected, or that is would not. On first reading, I assumed that it meant that they would be protected if they were at a junction of another hedge or a building. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has provided the Committee with drawings to clarify the situation and I shall hold one up to the Committee. It shows a hedgerow, at the junction of another hedge, that historically should be protected. According to the Bill, it would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can use something that cannot be put into 	<i>Hansard.</i> It may help his speech, but not the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for that guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. If the drawings have been provided to all members of the Committee, although I do not have them surely all the hon. Gentleman would have to do would be to refer to diagram A and diagram B.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that would work because the hon. Gentleman was pointing to a piece of paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek your guidance, Mr. Hill? The clause is extremely complicated. It might have been helpful, although it would be too late because we shall have dealt with the clause, if the notes provided by my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I should like to confirm that I understood that the notes had been circulated to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon .Gentleman would want me to quote the exact wording. The ruling is that it is not in order to use an exhibit as evidence, rather than as an illustration of a point made in a speech, or in such a way that reliance upon the exhibit renders a speech incomplete or incomprehensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to you, Mr. Hill, for that guidance, which is much clearer than the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the wording of clause 6(1)(b) is so complicated and unintelligible that it is unworkable and unfair to the people who have to interpret it. The amendment would simply delete the whole of clause 6(1)(b) so that all those hedges of less than 20 m would not be protected. The amendment is most sensible. Would anyone suggest that a hedge that is less than 20 m long—the length of a cricket pitch or, roughly, the length of this Room, a length that has been tried and tested in other schemes—is worth protecting? We are entering the same realm of debate that we entered for a whole morning when we discussed whether bits of urban hedgerow should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit in which we accepted the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East on urban hedgerows, I submit that he should accept the amendment, which would make the Bill considerably more workable for the people who must operate it. If we include small bits of hedgerows throughout the country, local authorities will be inundated with queries and difficulties, just as the amendments on urban hedgerows, which we discussed at such length, would have created difficulties. For clarity, fairness and ease of operation, the amendment is thoroughly worth while and makes the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I1002">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
simpler than would the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have added our support for the amendment in a probing spirit, but we are anxious to hear the response of the hon. Member for Surrey, East. I agree with the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that the phrasing of the clause is, unfortunately, convoluted. The clause begins with a double negative. I take clause 6(1)(b) to mean that a hedgerow is not protected if it is broken in any way other than by a junction with another hedgerow, with a building, or anything else. I should like to know what the clause aims to provide. What are the Government trying to exempt that is broken in different ways? We should like to understand the meaning of the drafting and whether the parliamentary draftsman had a good evening the night before, as I strongly suspect, so that we can decide whether to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the concerns of the hon. Lady. I want to ask about another point, on which I hope the hon. Member for Surrey, East and the Minister may be able to enlighten us. It is of critical importance that the farmer knows that the carrot and the stick of the hedgerow incentive scheme and the Bill march hand in hand. It is a principle of natural justice that if someone qualifies under one set of criteria, that set of criteria should also be appropriate under the other head. We want to avoid farmers entering a hedgerow of confusion over whether a hedge is likely to qualify for support under the incentive scheme or whether they are likely to be clobbered under the protection Bill. I have found the hedge measurement diagrams, and none of them looks remotely like the hedgerows that I am used to in Cornwall. That is because they are all in straight lines in the diagrams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 19 would exclude any hedgerow 20 m or less long. It would leave many short but valuable stretches of hedgerow unprotected. I accept that, in general, short hedgerow remnants are unlikely to be of any value, and the Bill recognises that the removal of such hedgerows should, on the whole, be permitted without the need to notify the local authority. That is why clause 6 makes provision for a de minimis exemption, permitting the removal of certain hedgerows 20 m or less long. However, where, for example, a short hedgerow forms part of a network of hedges, that hedge may have considerable value and should be protected by the Bill. I hope that the Committee agrees with that. I shall resist the temptation to draw the Committee's attention to the diagrams that have been referred to and circulated. I merely endorse the comment of the hon. Member for North Cornwall that they do not look much like hedgerows. The Bill attaches specific conditions to which short remnants may be removed. The crucial condition is that only one end of the hedgerow should be attached to another hedgerow—at least one end should be free-standing. That will ensure that short hedgerows that are part of a continuous network are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern that the attachment of conditions to the exemption may cause complications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a short hedgerow is attached to a continuous network, surely it is part of a long hedgerow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that I am trying to clarify for the Committee. The hon Gentleman's assumption is not correct. The complexity of the wording of the clause, which has been referred to, may in part have prompted my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury to table the amendment. I understand his concern about that and the wider issue. That is why I have tabled amendment No. 110. My amendment would remove the supplementary conditions contained in clause 6(2)(b)(ii). That would mean that hedgerows of 20m or less attached at one end to a building, natural barrier or interesecting fence could be removed without local authority approval. Hedgerow remnants attached in such a way are unlikely to be of any great value. The removal of the additional conditions would simplify and clarify the operation of the exemption and ensure that it was clearly understood by fanners, landowners and local authorities. My amendment would not greatly increase the number of hedgerow remnants that could be removed, nor would it lessen protection for short hedges that form an integral part of a hedgerow network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will be reassured that my amendment No. 110 would provide a definition of unprotected hedgerows that could be understood easily—for which I appreciate the need—both by farmers and local authorities. The definition is essential to protect valuable short stretches of hedge that form part of a continuous network. That is the purpose of my amendment. I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in a mess and I am not convinced by any of the arguments. I do not want to edge towards a clause-stand-part debate but I suspect that it would be better to forget about all the amendments, throw the clause out on clause-stand-part and hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East can produce a new clause that we all understand. There seems to be a good deal of agreement in Committee and great difficulty in interpretting the clause. If the Committee has difficulty interpreting it, what certainly is there for the farmer or landowner, the person in the planning office who has to implement it and the general public who may want it to be enforced? The clause, in any of the combinations that we have been offered, does not provide the necessary clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sympathy with the parliamentary draftsman, who has clearly had a great deal of work to do. If we are to spend another morning on the Bill—regretably, it looks as if we shall—it would be better to throw out the whole clause and replace it with a new clause on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Member for North Cornwall. If a hedge, however small, is at a junction with another hedge, it clearly forms part of the hedge. If it is less than 20 m long andhasagapof more than 10m; it is not covered by the clause either. If we have to debate what the clause means, imagine a poor farmer who does not have the back-up that we have, trying to interpret it. I wholly endorse what the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said. I ask my learned Friend the member for Surrey, East to withdraw the clause and return with a workable one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the explanation, my learned Friends and I wish to withdraw our support for the

	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
amendment. I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. The clause is enormously convoluted. I now understand it well enough to invite the hon. Member for Surrey, East to withdraw the amendment. It would weaken the clause. The clause is badly drafted. It is bad to legislate in this way. All of us have enormous difficulty in understanding what the clause means. I no longer want to give the official Opposition's support to the amendment. I agree with all members of the Committee who say that the clause is not good enough and needs redrafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. Members of the Committee are examining the clause as it stands. I urge my hon. Friends to examine the clause as it would be if the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East were accepted. It would remove clause 6(b)(ii). The clause would then be much simpler and much more easily understood. 16 would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"6.—(1) A hedgerow is not protected if—
	<ol>
	<li>it does not exceed twenty metres in length, and</li>
	<li>at one end of the hedgerow the continuity is broken otherwise than by—</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) a junction with another hedgerow".</p></blockquote>
I accept that it will be assumed that where a short length of hedgerow joins another hedge it is an integral part of it. That is not necessarily so unless the legislation spells that out. Clause 6(1)(b)(i) tries to make that crystal clear. My hon. Friend has made it clear that the wording of clause 6(1)(b)(ii) is complicated and unnecessary. He suggests that it be removed and replaced with simpler language. I say to my hon. Friends that it would be better to accept my hon. Friend's amendment and leave a shorter clause. If the clause were not accepted, there would be full protection for hedgerows of a couple of yards in length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the giveaway in the clause is subsection (2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations may modify subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
When a draftsman is in desperation he uses that device. On this occasion, regulations have some slight attractions. As I understand it, diagrams cannot be put into an Act, whereas they can feature in regulations. If the clause were removed, the exemptions may be made entirely by regulations. The Bill includes regulations and a definition that everyone finds difficult to understand. The Minister should advise his hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East to start again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the Opposition should want to leave it to the Secretary of State to make regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is already in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. It is extraordinary that the Opposition should suggest that my hon. Friend should not include a measure of length in the Bill. He was being helpful by including the measure of 20 m—although it is debatable whether that is the correct length—and setting out the circumstances in which small snippets of hedgerow
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
might not be protected. It is right to list the circumstances where hedgerows should not be protected and then allow them to be modified by regulation. It would be a big step not to indicate any intention but merely to say that the Secretary of State should produce regulations to specify what length of hedgerow, if any, is not protected and what bits adjoining buildings, lakes, ponds or fences—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we have anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is a power to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should not pass blank legislation and simply ask the Secretary of State to make regulations. I am not happy with amendment No. 110, tabled by the hon. Member for Surrey, East. It would weaken the Bill considerably. If paragraph (b)(ii) were removed, a piece of hedgerow broken by a building or a lake would not be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would not support such a weakening of the Bill. On the other hand, the Bill is so complicated and difficult to read that it is unreasonable to expect our fellow citizens to interpret it. We appeal for some cross-party agreement that the matter should be considered again on Report, rather than accepting amendments with which we are not happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us keep this in proportion. There are hundreds of thousands of miles of hedgerow that we want protected. There are many other hundreds of thousands of miles of hedgerow that we would give grants for, so that they can be replanted. We are getting bogged down in arguing about bits of hedgerow of five to 10 yd in length that may be stuck between a cattle barn and a lake or a fence. I say to the hon. Lady that it would not weaken the Bill to remove clause 6(1)(b)(ii) if that helped to produce clarity and understanding. If 100 yd of hedgerow from a total of hundreds of thousand miles is lost, so what? That is not the purpose of the Bill. I accept that there would be a marginal or tiny weakening of the Bill. However, it would be considerably weaker if it contained obscure language that was not understood. If people tried to obtain planning permission for obscure purposes, only to be told that they did not need permission, the Bill would be brought into disrepute. The amendment would substantially improve the Bill by making it more intelligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to amendment No. 19. I remind the Committee that the Bill provides that a hedgerow would not be protected if it did not exceed 20 m in length. That is an extremely simple concept. Everybody knows what we are getting at. We are under an obligation to make the Bill workable. We have accepted the wish of the Committee not to include little bits of urban hedgerow so as to make the Bill workable. The bits of hedgerow under 20 m in length that are worth protecting should not come within the scope of the Bill. Any other proposal would make the Bill bureaucratic and unworkable. I submit that amendment No. 19 should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East the Minister said. The problem is that the clause contains a double negative. I prefer to think that we seek to protect hedgerows that are under 20 m in length if they are linked, by a junction, to another hedgerow. My

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East is right to seek to omit the complication of an attachment to a building or a lake and so on. It would provide endless scope for argument. I am all for encouraging cottage industries, but I do not want to encourage stile making; that may be deemed to provide a way through regulations by creating gaps in hedgerows. I do not believe that it does but for that reason I support the proposal that regulations can be introduced by the Secretary of State at a later stage. That takes up what the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) said about legislation to protect badgers. I was involved with two similar Bills more recently and I know that sometimes we need to tighten regulations in the light of practical experience of the implementation of an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support both the clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, albeit with its double negative, and his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea because he was right in his analysis of what the clause would achieve. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury would severely impede the Bill's ability to deal with short stretches of valuable hedgerows where they are attached to others. I hope that Opposition Members understand that point and accept that my amendment would significantly simplify the clause, make it easier to operate and would not unduly weaken the purpose of the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the number of valuable hedgerows attached to buildings and so on will be very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 15 contains a definition of what constitutes a single hedgerow for the purposes of measurement and it may help members of the Committee to read it. That definition has been carefully thought out and will provide a system of measurement that can be applied with the minimum of subjectivity to all hedgerows. It is essential to allow the consistent implementation of the de minimis length of exemption. As a result of that, the number of hedgerows in any hedge network can be easily calculated to enable local authorities to bring multiple prosecutions, if necessary, against farmers and landowners who undertake large-scale, illegal hedgerow removal. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree with those aims in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill's provisions are practically considered by those to whom they apply, they will read clause 6(1)(b)(i) or (ii) but the guidance notes that are produced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I am confident that they will be far clearer and easier to understand than what is, of necessity, a legal document. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that my confidence is rewarded.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Hill. Are we now dealing with a Bill that will protect all hedges, irrespective of length? If so, we must bear that in mind as we proceed. Am I right in saying that there is no other provision that restricts the Bill to covering hedges of more than 20 m?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be legally correct, but does the hon. Member for Battersea understand the spirit in which the Committee divided. No one is saying that the Bill covers all hedgerows and that there should not be some exemption for short hedgerows. We must not become foolish in our interpretation of the Bill. We know that it will be amended later to make it more clear, and to ensure that it reflects the original intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. Would it be in order to table a new clause at our next sitting, which would make the position more clear to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any Member can table a new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. It may help the Committee if I say that it is not proposed to move amendment No. 20 and the others that are grouped
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
with it. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and I support amendment No. 73.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7 deals with the duty to reinstate the hedgerow that has been improperly damaged or removed. The purpose of amendment No. 73 is to question whose duty it would be reinstate the hedge. It asks whether the landowner or the person who damages the hedge should be held responsible. A simple example would be a road accident in which a lorry drove into a hedge, causing considerable damage. It seems grossly unfair that after such damage the landowner should be required to reinstate the hedgerow. We want hedgerows to be reinstated, but we tabled the amendment because we are worried that landowners might be improperly burdened when someone else was at fault and should be liable for putting right the damage done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard the example of a vehicle ploughing into a hedge and causing a long stretch of the hedge to be burnt. To anyone who does not live in the countryside and says that that cannot happen, let me say that it certainly can. When the undergrowth is dry, one spark can ignite a long stretch of hedgerow that is well outside the scope of the exemption that we have discussed and within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that, under the amendment, the person who commits the offence should be responsible for the reinstatement. If that person cannot be found and if the local authority requires that, for the public good, the hedge should be reinstated, the cost of reinstatement should be borne not by the landowner, who had nothing to do with the offence, but by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several discussion points that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East may be able to clarify. Let me give him another example—a picnicker who sets fire to a hedge or leaves in a hedge a bottle that subsequently ignites. If the picnicker can be found, he should be prosecuted by the local authority and required to reinstate the hedge. It is iniquitous that the landowner or the owner of the hedge should be responsible for the cost and trouble of reinstating it after an event with which he was entirely unconnected. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and I strongly support amendment No. 73 and hope that the Committee will also support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the amendment. If any other property were under discussion, we would be talking about a civil, not a criminal, case brought by the owner of the property against the perpetrator of the damage to that property. If a car runs into my house and sets it ablaze, the cost of reinstatement of the property is a matter between me, my insurers and the person who is guilty of the offence. The courts would not allocate the costs to that person. We must be careful about precedents in law. I am not a lawyer, but I should think that the case under discussion is a civil matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury supported the amendment, he seemed to be arguing that if the person who was guilty of the act could not be found, it should be for the local authority or some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I1006">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
other body, not the owner or occupier, to reinstate the hedge. However, that is not in the amendment that my hon. Friend was supporting, so I do not follow his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor do I follow the wording of the amendment, which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"in which case the duty shall fall automatically to the owner or occupier".</p></blockquote>
The word "or" implies that that could mean two people, whereas the Bill refers to the responsibility of the owner. The amendment would thus introduce into the law an element of uncertainty. I am sure that that is not the intention, but it is the effect of the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from my hon. Friend on agricultural tenants and the duty to restore. Under clause 3(1)(a) an agricultural tenant as defined by the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 can apply to a local authority for permission to remove a hedge. If he did that and it was required that that hedge be reinstated and he refused, the burden would fall on the landowner. I should be grateful for clarification from my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East about whether it would be possible to ensure that the person who applied for permission was finally responsible for restoration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should declare an interest in that my family owns a small, sadly diminished, amount of land in Lancashire which has some attractive hedgerows on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strengths of the amendment, which my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East might like to bear in mind, is that it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the owner or occupier of the land",</p></blockquote>
whereas clause 7 refers in line 6 to only the "owner of the land". That might pose problems given the different uses of agricultural land. Dealing with a full agricultural tenant is one matter, but will a person who occupies land on the basis of a grazing licence and whose stock damages a hedge be liable for the reinstatement of that hedge? Perhaps my hon. Friend could bear that in mind and provide clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it seems harsh to impose a duty on landowners to reinstate hedges when the offence has been committed by another person. The problem, as in so much else, is to provide a balance by way of alternative enforcement for provisions which are fair and which local authorities can effectively enforce. That is the reason for amendment No. 113.1 am not sure, given hon. Members' comments, that they have had a chance to study the amendment thoroughly. I believe that the amendment provides a simple solution by providing that references to the owner of the land for the purposes of enforcement include the tenant of an agricultural holding. I hope that that answers the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson), a tenant with grazing rights would not be held responsible for reinstatement. In those circumstances, his interest in the land would be deemed to be of such a short-term nature that it would not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
appropriate to hold him responsible. Were such a tenant found guilty of damaging a hedgerow against the provisions of the Bill, he would be liable to prosecution in common with anybody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that amendment No. 113 provides a suitable degree of flexibility. I appreciate that amendment No. 73 attempts to close a potential loophole by stating that if the person who committed an offence cannot be identified, the duty transfers to the owner or occupier. Identifying the person—or the picnicker, to pick up the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury—who committed the offence would still be difficult and would place an onerous burden on local authorities. How would one judge whether the person who committed the offence could not be found? Serving a hedgerow enforcement notice on an owner could result in a dispute about whether the local authority had made sufficient efforts to find the offender. The Bill requires that an enforcement notice be served within four years, but we shall, I hope, consider an amendment later which proposes reducing that to two years. Furthermore, a third party who committed the offence would have no powers to enter the land to reinstate the hedgerow in accordance with a hedgerow enforcement notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These difficulties have been recognised in other legislation. For example, the duty to replant a tree which is protected by a tree preservation order and which has been felled without consent, falls fairly and squarely on the landowner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will recognise and welcome that the provision that would be made by my amendment marks a break with the precedence set by tree preservation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where neither the owner nor the tenant of an agricultural holding is responsible for the offence, there are, of course, checks in the system which take account of that and which are designed to avoid any undue cases of unfairness. Clause 7(6) specifically provides for a landowner to apply to the local authority requesting it to dispense with the duty. The local authority would need to look closely at the circumstances of each particular case. It may decide to dispense with the duty or it may decide not to and serve a hedgerow enforcement notice on the landowner requiring him to reinstate the hedgerow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second check in the system would then come into play. The landowner may appeal to the Secretary of State against the enforcement notice. A specific ground of appeal is that in all such circumstances, including those involving wayward picknickers, the duty to reinstate should be dispensed with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham decided to withdraw their amendments, and I urge the hon. Member for Ladywood to do likewise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That response was a little unsatisfactory. We understand that, regarding picnickers, in 99 per cent, of cases it would be impossible to know who the individuals were, so the law would be unenforceable. However, the hon. Member for Surrey, East did not respond to our point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I1007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
about serious road accidents. From the point of view of equity and justice, it seems wrong that if a known individual has caused destruction which has to be put right by a landowner, that individual gets away with it completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is within the power of the landowner concerned to pursue the individual reponsible to obtain a refund of the cost incurred in reinstatement. That right exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I am a little old fashioned and have sympathy for farmers living close to cities, who often find that their lives are made wretched and miserable. Some of their farming activities are impossible to carry out properly. I am sure that the National Farmers Union could advise the hon. Gentleman about such problems. There is much crime and lawlessness that is never reported. I feel sympathy for farmers in that category, but their plight is ignored and burdens are placed on them. I am surprised that the Minister has not drawn this to the attention of the hon. Member for Surrey, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food will have had first-hand experience of the complaints of farmers in such circumstances. In one case, someone drove a van in a hedge merely because he wanted to take a shortcut. The Government virtually encouraged joyriding when, a few years ago, they reduced the sanctions that it attracted. Some youngsters who drive stolen cars recklessly to the common danger may have driven through hedgerows on numerous occasions. I think that it is reasonable for my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood to have tabled an amendment that would place the responsibility where it belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We find, however, this Conservative Government are aiming to acquit people who have committed grievous crimes and to place responsibility on farmers whom the Government are supposed to befriend. I find it incredible that the hon. Member for Surrey, East is not eager to accept amendment No. 73.I hope only that he and anyone who supports him on this matter will not talk about the Opposition being soft on crime. The evidence is contrary to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman does not acept our point. If a listed building is damaged, the owner has the responsibility of putting it back into good order and has a case against the person who damaged the property. I should expect that, as with a building, insurance would cover damage to a "listed" hedge. Fanners and landowners would be protected by their insurance if it proved impossible to pin the blame on an individual or if the individual is unknown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point made by the hon .Gentleman is fairly attractive, but a hedge is more fragile than a building. If a young criminal drove a motor car into a building, he would probably do more damage to himself than to the building. If he drove into a hedge, he would probably do no more than badly scratch the vehicle—which would not be his because it would probably have
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
been stolen—but he would badly damage the hedge. It is not the same thing. The landowner or farmer might find it extremely difficult to fight a case with the resources available to him. The farmer would probably not want the offender anywhere near his land, not even to rectify the damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit embodied in the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood is entirely responsible. It would reflect the position that has to be taken by society if it is to stand firmly for law and order in which the Opposition strongly believe. However, some Conservative Members take a light view of it. I trust that my hon. Friend will press the amendment because it is logical and appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The argument is that the farmer would be compensated by the person who caused the damage if the person is known. There would be a problem if the individual was nothing more than a man of straw. I suspect that on many occasions the individual might not be worth suing through the courts to get the money to reinstate the hedge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the onus were placed on the individual, replacing a hedge would involve considerable hard work but would be something that those vandals could do. There would be advantages in making the person who causes the damage reinstate the hedge. The more that criminals would have to replant trees or hedgerows, the quicker they would understand how much hard work is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in some urban and semi-countryside areas too much damage to the environment occurs by people acting stupidly and thoughtlessly, such as disposing of sump oil in a hedgerow ditch, which not only pollutes the ditch but damages the hedge. If people who were caught doing that had to experience the physical work of clearing up the mess, it would, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) said, be a good contribution towards law and order. There are merits in the amendment's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the Committee. We understand that the hon. Member for Surrey, East wants certainty. The owner would be known and strict enforcement would be possible. We want that, but we also want equity and justice. There will be a deep sense of grievance if high expense is incurred when the damage has been caused by someone else. That person might be known but might not be wealthy and, therefore, the possibility of a civil action would be weak. Under those circumstances, there would be a grave sense of injustice and disgruntled feelings about the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Surrey, East, with the advice of the Department, would agree to consider the matter, we would not press the amendment to a Division. Within the provisions for enforcement, it might be possible for the local authority to make good and to bill someone who fails to put back a hedgerow. That might be an appropriate measure. Instead of the poor old landowner having to go to court to sue someone who may not have the resources to pay compensation, the local authority could bill the offender.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I1008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's desire to ensure that the blame and burden falls on the person who commits the offence. If he could be pushed down a rabbit hole in the bottom of a hedge at the same time, fine. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Wentworth that many farmers would not want such people planting hedges anywhere near their land because they might fall down a week later. I accept the hon. Lady's suggestion that we should consider whether there is a way forward. But I reiterate my anxiety, which applies also to the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, that putting an option into the Bill—the responsibility may be on the owner or the occupier—opens a can of worms. Surely it is better to put the onus on the owner, who can then, if necessary, join the tenant in the action if he was partly responsible, perhaps through negligence. It is necessary to specify who is responsible and to avoid options in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that was an intervention. I shall not speak for long because I know that other hon. Members want to speak. The hon. Gentleman's last point is covered by amendment No. 113, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Surrey, East and which would put a duty on the tenant rather than the owner. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North also raised that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to help the Committee and not clash with it. If the hon. Member for Surrey, East were to agree to reconsider the matter and to introduce a fairer measure which does not penalise owners, we would not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Lady and the Labour party are so enthusiastically supporting law and order and the landed interest. I support the hon. Lady because the last thing we want to do is burden farmers unnecessarily with extra responsibilities arid costs in difficult times. If my hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East will reconsider the matter, many of us will be reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My party has always stood for justice for everyone. Those with less power and wealth tend to need more justice, but we support justice for the wealthy also.

I hope that there is consensus in the Committee and that the Minister and the hon. Member for Surrey, East will be able to introduce an amendment on Report to cover the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make three brief points. I agree with the hon. Member for Ladywood that there seems to be consensus that the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham and I and our amendment, which prompted other amendments, has achieved something positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if a hedge was destroyed, an owner or tenant who failed to reinstate the hedge, even if he had not committed the offence, could be taken to court and might acquire a criminal record. That is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there should be a time limit, otherwise the matter could be spun out indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
Thirdly, I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will reconsider his position. I am not entirely happy that the wording of amendment No. 113 is tight enough. If an agricultural tenant, as defined by law, is responsible for occupying and managing land, he should be responsible for the hedges. I should like the wording of amendment No. 113 to be tightened. Given what has been said, particularly about an occupier of land having a criminal record, I hope that the Minister will be redrafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not come as a surprise that, in view of the clear concerns raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, I am willing to give the matter further consideration. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, who spoke most eloquently, might be able to assist in producing an acceptable form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am minded of the possibility that not all farmers are as benign as my hon. Friend. Some farmers might collude with a third party, for example, to remove a hedgerow, and then the third party might disappear, along with the hedge, so that no redress would be available. I am anxious to confront that issue and also to take into account cases of new-age travellers and others, in which people invade property, cause damage and then disappear. Such cases should be taken into account in the interests of equity and justice. I am willing to give the matter further consideration with a view to making proposals to deal with the justified concerns raised by hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 21 would require the owner of the land, where an offence has been committed by the destruction or impairment of the quality of the hedgerow, to replace that hedgerow with one that would, in time, correspond to it in all significant featuers. The amendment has much to commend it. Clearly, in most instances, it is impossible to plant a new hedge that will immediately have the same qualities as the one that has been destroyed. I do not want to place an unduly onerous burden on farmers and landowners. Equally, it would be inappropriate to allow the replacement of a multi-species hedge with a thin line of Cupressus, for example. If a valuable ancient hedgerow has been illegally destroyed, it is right that the offender should be required to plant a replacement that, at least, has the obvious potential to grow to match the quality of the original.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 21 and 24 could provide a loophole in the system, which would not be welcome, as it could be argued that any newly-planted, single-species hedge will, given sufficient time, be infiltrated by other species and become a diverse hedgerow. It was on that very process of species infiltration that Hooper based his celebrated hypothesis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who was that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that Hooper was a swan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must not lose our concentration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed not, Mr. Hill. I referred to Mr. Hooper of hypothesis fame and to no other Hoopers of any kind. If I may briefly enlighten the Committee, Hooper formulated a theory that if one took 30 yards of any hedgerow and examined the number of species in it, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
number would correspond in hundreds to the years that the hedgerow had been there. The theory has caused immense interest and controversy in the environmental and agricultural world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one trouble with the theory was that it assumed that single species hedges had been planted? I have seen no reputable evidence that, when enclosures were planted, people planted hawthorn or blackthorn alone—I suspect that they planted whatever they could get hold of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention but I do not intend to allow the Committee to be led into a discussion of Mr. Hooper's theory, if I can avoid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 111 and 112 would require that the replanted hedge consist
	<br><blockquote><p>"of shrubs and trees of an appropriate size and species that will correspond"</p></blockquote>
to the previous hedge. That will provide the necessary flexibility and, given that the original hedge may have been decades or even centuries old, by specifying that the hedge must comprise of comparable species to the original, it will, at the same time, ensure that the replacement hedge has the potential to grow to match the quality of the original. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friends the Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham will be prepared to withdraw their amendments in favour of amendments Nos. 111 and 112, which are designed fully to meet their concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would agree entirely with my hon. Friend if I thought that his amendments say on paper what he says that they say, if that is not a Hooper's hypothesis. The difficulty is that the amendments, as I read them, propose that the species that should be planted to replace those that have been lost should be of an appropriate size, which is impossible. We are talking about replacing a hedge that has been dead for some time with a younger hedge that needs to grow to that size. The advantage of our amendments is that that is made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no way in which amendments Nos. 21 and 24 could be interpreted as saying that an historic hedge could be replaced with a row of leylandii. The new hedge should correspond, but in time. The wording of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East is confusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that my hon. Friend is misleading himself. The reference to size is simply to ensure that an ancient valuable hedgerow is not replaced by a row of bonsai plants. Size is also lateral, so the width of the replacement is also of concern. My hon. Friend is raising problems which I do not think should concern the Committee, although we are all anxious that the legislation will be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument about the amendment stems from a misunderstanding of how plants grow and hedges work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does "appropriate" mean in amendments Nos. 111 and 112? The courts might require that, if a 10 ft hedge
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I1010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
were removed, container-grown, 10 ft plants should be planted. That would be ridiculous. Amendments Nos 21 and 24 do not imply in any way that an historic hedge could be replaced by a leylandii. They aim to bring into account the time concept. A hedge that is 200 or 300 years old cannot be replaced overnight or, even, in one or two years. Given five or 10 years, however, it probably will be able to provide good habitat for wildlife and will look attractive. Amendments Nos. 21 and 24 are considerably easier to understand for the owners and farming community, and I ask the Committee to consider them seriously rather than amendments Nos .111 and 112, which are complicated and confusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly support the hon. Gentleman. If a hedge has not been well maintained over the years, has grown out at the top and is then damaged, it seems daft to expect someone to replace it with new trees which are too large for the hedge. In much of the country, hedges are allowed to grow up. They are then layered, brought back to a low height and allowed to grow up again. That cycle repeats itself, if the hedge is well maintained, for between 20 and 30 years. If a hedge is damaged, it seems reasonable to replace the damaged section with a new planting which, on the whole, would comprise low, short plants which would give a good bottom to the hedge and would probably be stock proof. That would be better than planting tall shrubs with no bottom in them, which might continue the facade of the hedge but have little chance of taking successfully. Short plants, properly planted, which go through the proper cycle of hedge maintenance, would be a logical choice. It does not seem to make much difference what size the plants are when they are put in, but it is important that they include a reasonable mix of species and that they have a chance of growing back into a properly maintained hedge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say. He is absolutely right. From my experience of having planted many different sizes of plants and shrubs, I think that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, smaller, bare-rooted shrubs can achieve as great a height and width, if not greater, than a container-grown plant of six or 10 feet which may not take. It may have a severe check when it is put in and, therefore, may do no better than a small, bare-rooted plant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to remember why we want to protect hedgerows. A small part of the reason is the visual aspect. However, most of the reason for protection concerns maintaining a habitat for a variety of animals—the rest of the species. That habitat depends on having hedges in the countryside in a variety of conditions. Some of them will be hedges which are well laid back and short, which will encourage new growth and strength in the bottom. Some will be more substantial. They will have been cut each year and brushed back. Sadly, there are far too many hedges in the countryside that have virtually grown out. Instead of being stock-proof hedges, they become isolated clumps of trees. They may have some aesthetic value, but they have very little habitat value. New clause 1, on which I had hoped to speak, demonstrates that part of the problem is not that hedges are being deliberately torn out, but that they are dying from neglect. If hedges are to be replaced when they have been torn out, it is important that they are replaced with
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
strong, stock-proof hedges which grow from the bottom and acquire substance so that they provide a good habitat for creatures and have plenty of light so that they become a haven for wild flowers. It is important to ensure that there is balance in hedgerows and that the Bill does not simply protect a few trees that may currently form a hedge line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon.

Friend can respond to it when he returns, although he does not yet know what it is. I want the hon. Member for Surrey, East to allay a suspicion. During a debate in the House on foxhunting about a year ago I said that I was not keen on legal prohibition but that I was keen on substantial hedgerows in every foxhunting shire in England and that I would not mind if most of them were 8 ft high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Crawley (Mr Soames)—the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—said that I was being cruel to horses. I replied that he should not accuse anyone of being cruel to horses given the size of horse that would be needed to carry him. I am worried that the clause may be a contribution to my suspicion. The amendment refers properly to corresponding plants, but the amendment may be a devious way of ensuring that hedges do not present a large obstacle to those who want to jump over them in pursuit of foxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to the Committee for trying to be in two places at once.

I do not want to prolong the argument or to be led into an argument on foxhunting. I stress to the hon. Member for Surrey, East that he must ensure that the Bill encourages a variety of hedges. We lack well-layered and newly-planted hedges to provide a variety of habitat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I assure the Committee that the Bill and the amendment do not contradict the aspirations that have been so well articulated by members of the Committee. The words that we are discussing are well established and appear in Part VIII of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and they have not caused problems in that context. In the case of tree preservation orders, there is the requirement to plant another tree of an appropriate size and species. That system appears to be working. That is one reason why I suggested that my hon. Friends are raising phantom
