	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 8, in page 1, line 10, after 'established', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>', after consultation with such organisations as represent persons and bodies with responsibilities under the Education Acts,".—	<i>[Mr. Win Griffiths.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we embark on this afternoon's proceedings, members of the Committee may like to know that it is my intention to break for dinner at 7 pm and to return at 8.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, I was talking about the consultation needed before the funding authorities are set up and about nomination rights. The Minister said that he would be responsible for selecting members of the funding authority, but I am sure that he would wish to take suggestions from other authorities. People need to discuss with him the regulations that might make that process a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious from the Bill that, at some stage, local education authorities and funding authorities will work closely together. Therefore, it is important that LEAs have the chance to make advance representations about how the funding authorities will be structured, and about their membership and their nomination rights. Does the Minister really believe that nothing useful can result from these consultations? The funding authorities will be non-accountable, consisting mainly of non-elected members. Therefore, it is important that we get their constitution right at the outset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consultation, as set out in the amendment, is important. The Bill proposes a change in how education is provided. The 1832 education provisions introduced the bare minimum requirements and we have now come almost full circle to the complete centralisation of the control of education. Before such changes are on the statute book, further consultation is necessary with the organisations and authorities that play a part in delivering education. The amendment recognises that necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was tabled because we were aware of the benefits of consultation in previous education legislation. There was genuine, open consultation before the Education Act 1944 which brought with it a consensus about the way forward in the provision of education. The Government must want as wide a coalition as possible on the future provision of education; the amendment would achieve that goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
The amendment would give the coalition of organisations involved in providing education another opportunity to make known their views on the creation of the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the White Paper in 1943, Rab Butler said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In all these education .questions, history has shown that there is a combination of the wisdom of administrators, who have always played a great part in formulating the plans". 	<i>—[Official Report,</i> 13 July 1943; Vol. 391, 	<i>c.</i> 1826.]</p></blockquote>
The amendment would allow that approach to the provision of education to continue. I am encouraged in my hope that the Government will accept the amendment because they repeated today the assertion made on Second Reading that the consultation process remains open. The amendment would make that promise real, as it would incorporate into clause 1 a commitment to further consultation before the funding agency for schools is introduced. The Minister need not worry about the amendment because there is no rush to bring in the funding agency. In the light of the statistics that the Minister gave the Committee this morning, there is time for detached consideration of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People involved in the provision of special educational needs are very worried that the 18 per cent. of pupils who are not entitled to statements, but who at some period in their school careers will have specific special educational needs, will find that they are outside the scope of the funding agency's activities. Further consultation would allow those people to tackle those matters in the Bill that concern them. We are likely to return to that point in more detail later on in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading of GERBIL, the great Education Reform Bill, the then Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) said that Lord Callaghan, in his time as Prime Minister, embarked upon a great education debate, in 1978. The former Secretary of State used that precedent as a justification for what the Education Reform Act contained. That precedent also shows that there should be further consultation about the contents of this Bill, as would be appropriate, given the promises made on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have no reason to fear the amendment, but I suspect that they will vote against it. The Under-Secretary of State for Schools said on Tuesday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can understand their misty-eyed nostalgia, but a progressive, forward looking Conservative Government need not look to the 1940s for guidance on the conduct of business. We know what we want to do and we shall press on and do it."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 17 November 1992; 	<i>c.</i> 31.]</p></blockquote>
I take that to mean that the Minister is not interested in consultation, although other Conservative Members have said that they are. However, the Minister can prove his genuine concern about consultation by accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a revealing little debate. At long last, we are beginning to get a glimpse of the origins of and background to, the Labour party's education policy. We have discovered that it goes back further than 1944, about which the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) has just spoken. It goes back to 1944 BC, as the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) disclosed earlier. That is worth bearing in mind as our deliberations proceed. I should be interested to hear the development of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
the Labour party's thoughts, and I am especially keen to hear the hon. Member for Bridgend develop his theory of education, which covers but does not extend beyond the period from 1944 BC to 1944 AD.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep within the scope of the amendment, but the point that I was trying to make was that the Minister, in opposing further consultation along the lines of what happened in 1944, claimed that the past had to be put behind us. I was referring to the fact that the Secretary of State—the Minister's boss—often spoke about the human condition and the fundamental moral issues affecting people throughout the ages. My point was that, even if it were true that the human condition had changed little between 1944 BC and 1944 AD, consultation was still important in the educational context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, discuss the fundamental human condition with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, I owe the Committee, which has been very patient so far, an explanation as to why the amendment is not only redundant but probably mischievous. Time and again, Opposition Members have confessed that one of their motivations in tabling the amendment is to secure further delay in the implementation of the Bill's provisions. They dress it up by referring to consultations, which is one of those comforting motherhood words, but what should we consult on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for Opposition Members to suggest that a small delay will do no harm; it could do considerable harm. Matters are made worse by the confusion among Opposition Members as to exactly which organisations should be consulted. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) was a little confused about how far the consultation procedure should go. I invite him to examine the working of the amendment because I do not think that it would allow consultation either with his holiness or with parishioners and the parish council. That is not how I read the amendment and I do not think that is what was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to suggest that the additional consultation period would be brief and limited. The tenor of the Opposition's argument was that it would be leisurely, extended, open-ended and involve any number of people; so it could be extremely lengthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being mischievous. If he checks the record tomorrow he will see that I specifically suggested that three months—certainly no more than six—would be plenty of time to carry out the consultation required by our amendment. There was no question of a leisurely process or a long delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is intriguing. The period that the hon. Gentleman is proposing is not a million miles from the period of consultation that we allowed after we published the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for missing his opening remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not miss much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those words from the Minister will be recorded in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
In answer to my point about the amount of consultation that has taken place, will the Minister place in the Library a list of all of the respondents to the consultation on the White Paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to table a parliamentary question on that matter, he would probably get an answer, although he is making heavy weather of the issue. I should be quite happy to do that. Ask and it shall be given is all I can say to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly I am asking, so I am delighted to hear that on asking I shall be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that has dealt with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has shown that Opposition Members are driven by producer interests—I suspect that that will be reflected throughout our proceedings, although I do not want to prejudge the issue. It is for Opposition Members to decide whether they want to be seen as representing parents—who we think are the main players in this drama—or the narrow producer interests. It is interesting that Opposition Members have put on record the representations that they have had from producer interests—I suspect we shall get a lot more of that, too. In a sense, they are engaging in the sort of consultation process that they are asking for in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), who has just entered the Committee, alluded to that point. His prescience is typical of him. He suggested the during our proceedings we shall be able to have a much more meaningful and direct consultation process. Members of the Committee will be approached by outside interests, they will ask for points to be clarified—not, I hope, at great length—and they will receive answers. My hon. Friend had that point in mind when he made his reference. It is exactly what the Committee is here to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Committee will not be seduced by the arguments of Opposition Members. The suggestion of further consultation is designed to delay, if not to undermine, the intentions of the Bill. The Second Reading gave us the green light to continue with the Bill's intentions. If the Committee agreed to the amendment, it would undermine the intentions of the Bill. I want to ensure that there is a proper framework to deal with grant-maintained schools in place as soon as possible. Any delay would be unacceptable and unconscionable; I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government, through the Minister, have made it plain that they want no further statutory consultation. We regret that because it is a question not of the so-called producer interest, but of parents who have contacted us about further consultation and of other groups who are—in the terminology of the Government—consumers of services in education. We think that there are matters relating to previous Education Acts about consultation that we can study and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 1, line 12, at end insert—

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 59, in page 1, line 25, at end insert—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendments inspire common support. It is in the interests of all of us to ensure that public money is used efficiently and effectively and that there is accountability in the use of public funds. Amendments Nos. 53 and 59 are aimed specifically at obtaining that assurance. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendments, I hope that they will have a reasoned argument why they are inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister agrees. I shall argue in favour of the insertion of a clear remit that the funding agency should operate with those particular and specific objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had 10 or 12 years in which the spending on education has not increased in terms of the percentage of the national wealth of the country; it has decreased, which is unfortunate. Nevertheless, large sums of public money—about £8 billion of taxpayers' money—are being spent on the education service. The remainder of the money is raised through local taxpayers. If we are reaching nearly £10 billion of public money that is being spent on the school sector, there is a powerful argument for ensuring that the money is spent efficiently and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By submitting the amendments, we are trying to smoke out the Government's thinking behind the real powers of the funding agency. What will be the role of the funding agency? If its sole role is to act as a bank manager sending out cheques to grant-maintained schools, there may be a strong argument for saying that it should not have a monitory obligation. If the funding agency is to have a more powerful role and is to monitor how schools are conducting their business, it should have some stated objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty clause give power to the funding agency, yet no clause sets out its objectives. If we give powers to the funding agency, we should also give it a clear remit. We are considering billions of pounds of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one of the funding agency's important objectives should be to spend that money efficiently and effectively. The amendments would place the burden of achieving that objective on the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all be committed to the efficient use of resources. The Bill contains obstacles to that objective. We need to discuss clause 7, which is relevant to the amendments because it refers to the dual responsibility of the funding agency and the local education authority for the period of time when between 10 and 75 per cent. of pupils in the primary or secondary sector attend schools that have achieved grant-maintained status. Such a dual responsibility is inefficient. It will merely duplicate responsibilities and obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
Amendment No. 53 would require the funding agency to operate efficiently and effectively. If it is accepted, we can table amendments to clause 7 that would reflect the new requirement. Clause 7 contains a time bomb, which will prevent the funding agency from operating efficiently because it will have to share responsibilities and obligations with the local education authority. The lines of responsibility will be blurred. That will make accountability to the public difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, especially on accountability. The Select Committee on Education has been unhappy about education funding under the present system. The money that is provided for education through local authorities is not ring-fenced. I support the provision for a funding agency because it is more accountable than the current system. The hon. Gentleman would have to say a lot more to convince me that I was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those parents who live in the 64 local education authorities that exceed their standard spending assessment are probably thankful that money for education is not ring-fenced. If it were ring-fenced, there would be budget cuts in real terms in the money that is spent on education in those areas. Two thirds of local education authorities ignore the Government's education spending targets and say that they are prepared to commit themselves to the educational needs of their areas. There is therefore an overspend—the Government's definition—of more than £500 million. Ring-fencing education spending would drive down standards in those areas where local education authorities overspend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may know that my local education authority overspends. A recent survey showed that that money did not reach the schools. Surely that is the issue. We need to ensure that the money gets to the schools. A funding agency will do that. It certainly has not been done by over-spending local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's concern, but on occasions such as this we should be conscious of the facts. When the figures were first published for LEAs that had delegated budgets to schools, a parliamentary answer from the then Under-Secretary, Michael Fallon, listed those authorities and the percentages that had been held back for central administration. The authority with the largest holdback for central administration was Westminster. Those initial figures were published by the Government about 12 months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Lady's concern and I agree that the money should find its way into schools. That is why, when I was involved in a local authority, we supported the delegation of budgets to individual schools. I remind hon. Members that prior to the Education Reform Act 1988, local authorities delegated budgets to schools throughout the country. Unfortunately, the practice became distorted because of the strict formula of the local management of schools. It operated much more effectively when local authorities were allowed to delegate the actual cost of teachers' salaries, which they are no longer allowed to do because of the rigid formula under which they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important element is that there must be local accountability. Let us imagine the difficulty of a group of parents, with all the responsibilities that we accept they have, being also responsible for the use of public money.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
I would much prefer that a democratically elected body representing the interests of the whole community had that obligation to discharge. Our worry is that if the funding agency is established, local education authorities will be replaced by a body that would no longer be under statutory obligation to operate efficiently and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should reflect on two provisions in legislation. Section 7 of the Education Act 1944 provides an obligation on LEAs that
	<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient education … shall be made available to meet the needs of the population of their area."</p></blockquote>
That provision would be lost under the funding agency. The most important aspect is that currently LEAs have to operate under the guidance and jurisdiction of the Audit Commission and the local district auditors. Those bodies are in a very powerful position. Their responsibilities and obligations differ from those of the National Audit Office, which will have some responsibility over how the funding agency uses public money.

The Audit Commission and the auditors have a different role. The commission is charged with the responsibility to ensure that local education authorities operate in an efficient and effective manner. Indeed, it can go further. It can require—and itself undertake—that an exercise be carried out to identify whether an LEA is getting value for money in the provision of its services. Many useful and constructive reports from the Audit Commission have helped LEAs to discharge those responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made the case for efficiency in the funding agency and for good co-operation between the agency and the local authority. He will realise that co-operation runs two ways. My hope is that when the funding agency is up and running he will encourage his local authority to co-operate with it precisely as he describes. To that end, he should have a word with his colleagues in Birmingham. The headmaster of Small Heath school, which has opted out, says
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wanted a new relationship, a partnership with the LEA based on autonomy and mutual respect, which would be for the benefit of our pupils and our local community."</p></blockquote>
Far from helping to achieve that, the local authority, for vindictive and ideological reasons, turned its back on the opted-out schools and the communities that they serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that we could not get through a day without the subject of Birmingham being raised. I hope that similar consideration can be given to the other 115 LEAs in England and Wales. That would be helpful. The Bill does not cover only the city of Birmingham, but all 116 LEAs. The amendment would require the funding agency to operate in an efficient and effective manner and be accountable for the use of public resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking about the valuable role played by the Audit Commission in assisting LEAs to discharge their duties. All hon. Members would agree that the Audit Commission's work on special needs, in conjunction with Her Majesty's Inspectorate with "Getting on with the Act", has been very useful. A report came out in the summer and an Adjournment debate on the subject was initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), in which a number of Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
Members spoke. That debate concentrated on many of the suggestions and views contained in the Audit Commission report. I am pleased to say that the Audit Commission did not leave the matter there. It recently issued what amounts almost to an agenda for action, dealing with ways in which the good practice outlined in the report could be implemented in a local authority area. That is a good example of the way in which the Audit Commission discharges its responsibilities towards LEAs by showing the way forward. Many LEAs have accepted and endorsed many of the report's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission recently published a detailed analysis of the way in which local authorities operate home-to-school transport. Many savings were identified and many LEAs have accepted the recommendations contained in those practical and positive reports. As a result, hundreds of thousands of pounds a year are being saved in LEA budgets by the more efficient use of resources for home-to-school transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission has been extremely helpful in two other ways. It produced a detailed survey of the way in which capital has been used by local authorities to reduce the revenue spending on school building maintenance. It was also one of the first bodies to draw attention to the question of surplus places. I know that the Government and the LEAs are concentrating on that now, but it was the Audit Commission that first highlighted the importance of tackling the issue of taking out surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those four examples show how useful it is to have a body overseeing the work of LEAs and ensuring that public money is spent efficiently and effectively. The present position with regard to grant-maintained schools is instructive. The funding agency will operate closely with the grant-maintained schools sector, which is not subject to the Audit Commission. The Bill does nothing to change that. A grant-maintained school appoints its own auditors. The Audit Commission does not appoint auditors to oversee the operation of grant-maintained schools, nor can it appoint its own auditors to audit the accounts of a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such schools are quite separate when it comes to accountability for the use of public resources. That has caused great concern for the Audit Commission, which has requested the Government several times to allow it to appoint auditors to oversee the way in which public money is being spent in grant-maintained schools. It is a matter for deep regret that the Government have continually refused its request. Tens of millions of pounds of public money are spent each year in the grant-maintained sector, but that is not subject to public scrutiny by the Audit Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Audit Office is to publish a report just before Christmas on the accountancy practices and procedures adopted in the grant-maintained sector. We all await its comments with interest. It would be useful if the Minister would give us a guarantee that any recommendations contained in that report will be incorporated into the Bill, perhaps by Government amendment. The National Audit Office is deeply concerned about the practices in some of the grant-maintained schools that it surveyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safeguards are required because there is no obligation on the funding agency to work efficiently and effectively. There is a vacuum in the Bill. If we have the common goal of ensuring that public money is spent in the best possible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
way, what is wrong with amending the Bill to require public accountability to ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the legislation that sets up a separate further education sector from April 1993, a clear obligation is placed on the Further Education Funding Council to make the most efficient use of resources. If it is correct to require that council to take account of the most efficient use of resources, why should that not be the case for the funding agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be difficulties with the funding agency. If, as the Government say, the grant-maintained sector will be continually expanding, we will not know from one year to the next how many schools will be funded. That will have to be guessed. A sum will have to be allocated on the basis of the best possible projection. During the year it may become clear that not all the schools will achieve grant-maintained status. Will that money be held by grant-maintained schools, will it go back to a central pot of money or will it be allocated to the local education authority? That is a difficult issue and it would help if the funding agency were required to discharge its responsibilities efficiently and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to safeguard the use of public resources. We shall all listen with interest to the Government's response to this reasoned and reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 18. I hope that we shall have a separate vote on that amendment. It is a probing amendment to examine the status and functions of the funding agency. Earlier, the Minister was warm in his praise for my analysis of the distinction between an "agency" and a "council". He preferred the term "agency", based on the definition of an agency as an executive arm of Government, part of a Department hived off for convenience—whereas a council is a free-standing body with more autonomy and freedom from Government. The Minister said that of the two, we were talking about an agency. I question whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By my definition, an agency refers to something akin to the sort of organisations referred to in the efficiency unit's report to the Prime Minister entitled, "Improving Management in Government: the Next Steps". We would, therefore, be talking about a "next steps" agency. We would expect such an agency to have a chief executive. I hope that the Minister will clarify the mechanism by which the chief executive of the agency will be appointed and assure us that the post will be open to public competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that the proposed agency will have a chairman and board members. That leaves me somewhat confused. If it is not a "next steps" agency, because it has a chairman and board members, neither is it a council, which is a free-standing, more independent body, like the Further Education Funding Council. It is difficult to understand the precise nature of the body. The amendment, therefore, seeks greater clarity of its nature—it appears to be a hybrid. Does the Minister accept that it is a hybrid? If not, which of the two bodies is it? Is it partly a quango, with appointed members, or an executive agency performing a grant-paying function similar to the role of the Department for Education school branch 4? Does the Minister anticipate that the role of the agency will change in time if he is lucky and the number of grant-maintained schools increases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
The amendment is vital because it refers to consultation with various bodies when the proposals are in operation. The minister is concerned only with ensuring that the establishment of the agency is not delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a "next steps" body, will it, as one would expect, have performance targets and a clear management plan? If so, will the Minister explain what they will entail? We are anxious because clause 6(1) gives sweeping powers of direction to the Secretary of State, which almost implies the opportunity for day-to-day interference by Ministers. It is vital that the role and function of the agency are clarified. If there are not, the grant-maintained schools that will be looked after by the funding agency will themselves be anxious and may prefer to continue to deal with school branch 4 rather than with a new body whose role and function is imprecise and unclear. If the funding agency is merely a hived-off Department, do the Government intend to staff it with personnel transferred from school branch 4? What targets and expectations does the Minister have for such staff?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been said many times that it would have been far better to have a body established and explained clearly in the Bill, with published responsibilities and a clear relationship with all the other involved bodies—not least with the customers, consumers and grant-maintained schools, over which it will have so much power and responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also be clear about the relationship between the Department for Education, the LEAs, the schools concerned and the funding agency. After all, it is not a new sector into which the funding agency suddenly finds itself; it is a sector in which there is great expertise. The funding agency should not miss out on that expertise. It is vital that there should be detailed consultation, not only with the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools, but with the key providers of education—the LEAs. It is another opportunity in which the Minister can exercise that flexibility of which he is so proud—and rightly so—and accept the amendments. If he is not prepared to do so, I hope that he will clearly answer my various questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask right hon. and hon. Members to support the amendments because I cannot believe that anyone would wish the funding authorities not to operate effectively and vigilantly. It is important that that is set out clearly in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak first on the issue of accountability and cite an example of an incident at the former Anglia polytechnic—now a university—which is in my constituency. It has a similar status to that that the grant-maintained schools will have under the new funding authority. The example shows why funding authorities should be accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two years ago, a consultant was appointed by the then polytechnic to advise on its contracting-out procedures—a grant-maintained school might well be involved in that. Subsequently, the consultant submitted a bid for the contract and it was awarded to him. As a result, many of my constituents lost their jobs through redundancy. I am not saying that the polytechnic behaved improperly, but I think that an investigation is needed. For some weeks, I have been trying to get a proper investigation and to find out to whom the board of directors of the polytechnic is accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
I wrote to the Audit Commission, which told me that it was no longer responsible for the polytechnic because it dealt with local authorities only. I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading and was told that it was no longer its responsibility, either. I wrote to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy—CIPFA—and received a letter stating that as the writer was a member of the board of directors of Anglia polytechnic, he felt that it was not right to comment. I also wrote to the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Is the hon. Lady in order talking about polytechnics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same point was crosssing my mind. I was about to ask the hon. Lady to relate her remarks directly to the amendment. I hope that she will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that reminder, Sir John. An approach was made to the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council several weeks ago, but I have not yet had a reply. I am unsure about that council's accountability. I fear that the same problem could apply to the funding agency for schools unless proper protective measures are included to make that body as accountable as local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady not realise that much of this debate would not be taking place were it not for the fact that her friends in education authorities failed miserably in their provision of education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard that as a matter of opinion, which I do not necessarily share. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that my LEA is Conservative controlled, however, so the polytechnic is not accountable to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present arrangements, LEAs are accountable through the democratic procedure of four-yearly elections, and if the public dislike what they are doing, there is a good remedy. Funding authorities will not be similarly accountable, and, in view of the events at the polytechnic, I am worried that the same situation could arise in schools, and on a much greater scale, especially if the Government are successful in persuading yet more schools to take grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost reluctant to rise to speak because I feel that I shall be helpful to the Government. I feel sure that when the sitting is over the Whips will take me aside and castigate me severely for supporting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with some insider knowledge of these matters. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, whose knowledge of working in schools stretches back some way, I have had recent experience of working in a large comprehensive school that, like many others, considered opting out and making a new relationship that potentially would develop, not with the LEA, but with a new public agency, whatever it might be. We must remember that schools do not exist in a vacuum, in isolation. They rely heavily on advice, help and guidance from local authorities. As I said on Second Reading, primary and secondary schools would not have
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
successfully implemented the national curriculum had it not been for the work of LEAs; nor would we have implemented the GCSE as successfully as we have. It was the relationship with LEAs, which helped, guided and advised the schools, which made the implementation successful. Local management of schools in my constituency could not have occurred without the LEA, which drew up the software, advised the schools and, more importantly, provided ongoing assistance to schools. That is the answer to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) who asked why some schools do not want to opt out. The hon. Gentleman said that Small Heath school felt ostracised and certainly, one cannot leave a club yet expect to continue using its facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the LEA system, cross-fertilisation of ideas occurs between schools. Good ideas are thus shared. I have attended discussions about opting out. I have listened to many people in Devon, who are not old socialists such as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth. They are bank managers, colonels and the forces of county stability. With my limitless impartiality, I was able to advise them. I hesitate to support the amendment, although I shall do that if my arm is twisted, because it goes only some way towards giving schools the confidence to opt out. Schools fear losing the LEA framework. The amendment would give the funding agency more responsibility than simply handing out a cheque. If the relationship between the funding agency and the school is simply financial, schools will not become grant-maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may introduce a further point that will persuade the hon. Gentleman not to support the amendment. Does he recall that, some years ago, many direct-grant schools existed? Direct-grant schools operated efficiently by obtaining central funding. They were innovative schools, which achieved much that was worthwhile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not completely accurate. Direct-grant schools were not centres of innovation. They existed in areas where many schools were still in the local education system, which acted as a support network for the direct-grant schools. They could not have been successful without LEAs. That is also true of independent schools in many areas. Some LEAs, including that in my constituency, liaise with the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reluctantly support the amendment because schools that are considering GM status want more advice, assistance with the use of resources and to believe that their actions are publicly accountable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an ancient socialist who has discussed this topic often with Kier Hardy, I should like to declare a producer interest, which is something that the Minister seems to abhor. I have produced four children, all of whom went through the comprehensive school that I helped to set up. I am nothing if not content with their progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it odd for a Conservative Minister to imply that there is something awful about producer interests. In every other case—including that of the production and advertisement of cigarettes—the producer comes first. It is only in schools that producers are somehow taboo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that the Minister examines history properly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) suggested. At our previous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
sitting, I asked the Minister to meditate occasionally. I should like him to meditate on what Solon said about education and the philosophy of meeden agan. That is clearly at the root of the matter. The Minister need not respond until he has had time to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) spoke about direct-grant schools, of which I have personal experience, having been educated at one in Leeds. Direct-grant schools exist because orders such as the Jesuits provided a specialist education for Catholic children who otherwise would have gone to the board schools that had existed for many years. Those direct-grant schools were only available to a minority of children. Their relationship with the funding authority simply involved getting grants. In an attempt to get away from that system, every direct-grant school has given up that status and adopted voluntary aided status, as that gives them a direct relationship with the local authority and not with the materialistic funding authority proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I taught for a number of years at a direct-grant school in Manchester. That school ceased to be a direct-grant school because such schools were abolished by the Labour Government of the time. Many of those schools became independent—unwillingly, because they would have preferred to remain funded by the state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. One school in Batley took the route described by the hon. Gentleman. It is a shame that they do not play better rugby league there, but that is by the by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's own definition of the functions of the funding agency is worrying. In a parliamentary answer he said that that agency
	<br><blockquote><p>"is to have power to pay grants to the governing body of any GM school which is being discontinued where it is for the purpose of discharging any of the liabilities".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that the funding agency can allow a school such as Eton to extend its territory and take over such premises? Can it allow Eton to take up a residual interest in those children? Would the funding authority pay for it? Or do certain restrictions and strictures already exist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially worried by what the Minister said in that answer about
	<br><blockquote><p>"the function of determining proposals by a governing body significantly to change the character or enlarge the premises of a GM school."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 17 November 1992; Vol. 214, 	<i>c.</i> 174.]</p></blockquote>
That is extremely worrying, because it implies that what happened with the so-called public schools will happen again. They were set up for charitable purposes, but those schools cost the people who attend them a great deal of money. Relatively few pupils receive charitable assistance. They certainly are not generally for the poor. Is that what lies behind the proposal? Will it ensure that a certain number of schools are for people like us, who are upper-middle class by virtue of being Members of Parliament, and not for the poor? That would be tragic, and if it is not what the Minister intends he should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a reference in a moment that might short-cut the debate. Meanwhile, to help hon. Members I direct them to schedule 1. Under the heading "Accounts" in paragraph 15(3) it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Comptroller and Auditor General shall examine, certify and report on each statement received by him in pursuance of this paragraph and shall lay copies of each statement and of his report before each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
That paragraph states the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which will be crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2, paragraph 3(4), which is also crucial and has a bearing on the amendments, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this paragraph requires a funding authority to take any action where to do so would not be an effective use of their resources."</p></blockquote>
Those paragraphs encapsulate what is in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go further in setting hon. Members' minds at rest and commend to the Committee an illuminating document, "Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments", which is in the Library. It will be the bible for the establishment and running of the funding agency for schools. I encourage hon. Members to peruse the document and hope to persuade them that because it will guide the FAS, the amendments are redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not delay the Committee—we on the Government side want to move on—but the contents contain items such as "cost-effectiveness". Chapter 5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the main aim of all NDPBs is to carry out their duties as efficiently and effectively as possible, within available resources, for the benefit of taxpayers, customers and staff."</p></blockquote>
It continues that each NDPB should have a strategic planning system geared to its particular needs to include a corporate plan and an annual business, or operating, plan. I shall not go into details referring to budgets and operating plans, the delegation of financial responsibilities and so on. I hope that I have given a sufficient guide to Opposition Members who raised those matters in the context of the amendment. Most of what the amendment seeks is adequately covered by the document, the guide under which the funding agency for schools will be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can go further and reassure hon. Members that the funding agency for schools will be accountable, in a financial and operational sense, through the accounting officer of the Department for Education. The accounting officer is a formidable and fearsome individual who also masquerades under the title of permanent secretary. He is responsible for the financial affairs and conduct of the Department and for bodies set up under the aegis of the Department, including, for the purposes of our discussion, the funding agency for schools. Through him, there will be accountability to the Public Accounts Committee and to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will agree that the Public Accounts Committee acts in an historical context, and considers errors or financial problems that already have taken place. If what the Minister says is correct, he has nothing to fear from the amendments, which will give the funding agency for schools the same status as the LEAs with which it will co-operate. The Minister should therefore accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention gives me an opportunity to say something about this sort of amendment, which I hope will help members of the Committee. There is a long-standing tradition in the House that if amendments were designed simply to restate in the Bill something that would happen anyway, that would result in redundant and bad law, however comforting it might be to some hon. Members. I am advised by Parliamentary Counsel and others that it is not advisable to overload a Bill that will become a statute with worthy statements that would simply replicate what exists elsewhere. The amendment comes into that category. There is no virtue in re-emphasising something that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
already exists by putting it in a Bill. The document so comprehensively covers the intentions of the amendments that they would be redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the guide that the Minister referred to has been available for some time and that it is not a recent publication. If so, and given that the guide is an important document, why was it necessary to include in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, section 2(5), which refers to an explicit obligation on the further education funding council to discharge its functions in connection with the administration of funds so as to make the most efficient use of resources, when it is apparently not necessary to include it in this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question and there is an even better answer. The Further Education Funding Council is a very different body from the funding agency for schools for a variety of reasons. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is the expert on these matters might, if pressed, feel moved to expatiate at some length on those reasons. However, I shall discourage him for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, this is, in a sense, a new document. It is a revision and update of one that has been in operation for some time. The guide replaces the 1985 edition of the same title and reflects many helpful suggestions made by users of the earlier version. It appears in this form because if may need to be revised shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the current version, which will be updated as necessary to make it fully effective in the light of changing events. Therefore, it is far to say, whatever may have been the case when the statute that the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) mentioned came into effect—which was quite recently—it would not have been covered by this version of the guide, which will cover the funding agency for schools when it comes into being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is March 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask this question because I am not sure of the exact position regarding funding agencies. Are we talking about one funding agency or several funding agencies? My understanding is that when the Bill becomes law, 30 or 32 areas will immediately qualify for a funding agency. Will there be one funding agency in each area, or will one funding agency cover all the areas? Will there be one office for all areas, or one in every area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be one funding agency for schools. It will be free to develop in response to the rate at which the grant-maintained school sector grows which will, in all likelihood, be different up and down the country. That is why we shall, at some point, be debating an amendment dealing with regional organisation and we can cover the matter more comprehensively then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The direct answer to the question of the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) is that there will be one funding agency for schools, but it will have the flexibility to respond to the way in which and the rate at which the grant-maintained sector grows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) asked about staffing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister on the question of guidance, raised by my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
Friend the Member for Wallsend. The hon. Gentleman said that the guide was drawn up in March this year. He will recall that the Standing Committee that considered the Further and Higher Education Bill, on which I served, met at about that time. Were members of that Committee not aware of the preparation of the document? Had they been made aware of that, would the Further and Higher Education Act have turned out differently?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot possibly speak on the deliberations of another Standing Committee on another Bill. Versions of this document have been around since 1985, so there have obviously been versions of it for public view, and no doubt one was in the Library when the Committee was sitting. The version to which I am referring and which I have commended to the Committee, came out in March 1992 and therefore, it is the one that we should consider as being the guide for our FAS, not for their FEFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the central point. The Minister has already said in response to my hon. Friends that the amendments are irrelevant because there already exists something that performs the task that the amendments propose. That same guidance would have applied to the Further and Higher Education Act. The Minister cannot dismiss the point by saying that it is irrelevant here and that he cannot go into the details of a previous case, although his hon. Friend might, if we press him. We need to know why the guidance was necessary in the formative stages of the Further and Higher Education Act, and why it is unnecessary here. The Minister cannot escape the fact that the parallel is exact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer for the deliberations of another Committee in another Bill, nor can I speak on behalf of the FEFC. I believe that the objectives of the amendments are covered by the guide, which is in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, although I think that it is becoming slightly tedious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. Were the clauses that he mentioned as justification for rejection of the amendments new in the revised version of the information that has quoted, or did they exist before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained that the information is an up-dated revision of a document that appeared in 1985. It will continue to be updated to take account of changing circumstances—it is no more mysterious than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Might it be helpful if we adjourn so that the Minister can consult with his hon. Friend who is responsible? There is some confusion within the education ministerial team. In the interests of progress, the Minister should seek the guidance—dare I say consultation—that might lead to clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree to an Adjournment at this stage. If there is confusion, I am sure that it will be resolved in the course of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath raised an important question. The initial staffing of the FAS would come principally from officials in the Department for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
Education—those people whose duties are similar to those that would be performed by the FAS. Once the FAS was established, it would decide on the suitability and recruitment of staff. That is covered in the guide, which lays out the responsibilities and powers of such a body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was another part of the question, which referred to the appointment of the chief executive. Would that be an open appointment, to which anyone could apply or would it also be a transferred post from wthin the existing departmental structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not decided that yet. It is somewhat premature, since we have not yet finished the Committee stage of the Bill, but it will be made known in the usual way in the fullness of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of the amendments is contained in the clauses and schedules 1 and 2, but also in the guide to non-departmental public bodies. The combination of the provisions in the Bill and in the guide more than amply meets the objective that was not unreasonably set out in the amendments. I ask the Committee to reject them because they are otiose. That is the most excellent reason for rejecting amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two points that have not been clarified sufficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to schedule 2, paragraph 3(4) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this paragraph requires a funding authority to take any action where to do so would not be an effective use of their resources."</p></blockquote>
He claimed that as a reason for not including the amendments in the Bill, because he said that that covered their objective. If the Government were to realise their ambition for the grant-maintained sector—probably sometime in the 22nd or 23rd century—schedule 2, paragraph 2 would not apply. Once 75 per cent. of pupils in local authority schools are in the grant-maintained sector, the funding agency takes over complete responsibility for the provision of school places. However, the schedule applies only to that period of joint responsibility with the LEA. The implication is that once that joint responsibility exists, it is necessary to insert into the schedule that the funding agency could not be forced to use its resources in an efficient manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggests that the guidance in the document to which the Minister referred—I was grateful that he did—is not strong enough to cover the issue of joint responsibility with the LEA for school places. I wonder how strong, effective and clear the guidelines are for the operation of the funding authority. If they were fully effective all the time, there would be no need to include that paragraph in schedule 2. Exactly the same argument applies to the efficient use of resources, as outlined in the schedule, as applies to the acceptance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the efficient use of resources is also important in terms of the Bill's financial memorandum and the financial effects outlined on page xvi, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is expected that the costs of the funding authorities will be offset over time by savings in the running costs of the Department for Education and the Welsh Office and the central administration costs of Local Education Authorities, as well as the removal of surplus places at their instigation."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, the financial effects suggest that the Government are paying high regard to the efficient use of resources, but, at the same time, they suggest that the guidelines in the document to which the Minister referred are powerful enough for us not to add anything to the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
despite the fact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend pointed out, that that specific provision is included in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there were fundamental differences between the two bodies, but when we examine the essentials of both cases they are similar. Perhaps the Minister can say whether the Further Education Funding Council is covered by the guidelines or whether it is not a non-departmental body. Identifying the guidelines may be going a little beyond the remit of the amendment. Nevertheless, it appears that the council is not covered by the guidelines from which the Minister read. If it were, the clause would be unnecessary. Therefore our amendments remain justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 relates to performance targets. The Minister read from the guidelines, which no doubt we shall want to read in the Library during our dinner break. I did not ascertain whether the need for performance targets was in the planning requirements. We have had some difficulty with the Government's handling of performance targets of different sorts, which perhaps is why the Minister did not elaborate on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard nothing about the other demand in the amendment that the functions of the funding agency being exercised
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the management plan and performance targets approved by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
should be determined in consultation with the grant-maintained sector, which will be directly affected by the funding available to the agency, does the Minister intend consultation to take place, and with LEAs? Where joint responsibility exists, as it will under the Bill until the 75 per cent. opt out is attained, the LEAs, too, must have an interest in the way in which the funding agency carries out its responsibility. Can the Minister elaborate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about schedule 2, it is best to explain as follows. The provision is required to cover the somewhat unusual circumstances of the parallel regime that would run between the FAS and the local education authorities. In other words, the duty of the FAS to secure sufficient school places need not, and should not, operate where it is economically more sensible for an LEA to make provision in that way. That is a particular circumstance to the type of regime that the Bill covers which requires the special provisions of schedule 2 but, beyond that, the more general provisions that I mentioned in the now increasingly famous document would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document also covers the matter of output and performance targets and measures—the sub-heading of paragraph 5.13. That paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All NDPBs should seek to develop output and performance targets and measures. These should be incorporated in the overall planning process and in budgeting and management information systems. Particular points which all sponsor departments and NDPBs should consider are:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>coverage … comprehensiveness … analysis."</p></blockquote>
When the hon. Gentleman takes time during his dinner break to read the document, he will find it both comprehensive and reassuring. It covers all those issues, so, in that respect, he can be reassured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unable to reassure the hon. Gentleman that when we set up the FAS and it begins to operate under this guide in order to determine its objectives and to plan, that it will consult all and sundry about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just two specific bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member asks for just two specific bodies. I do not think that there are two specific bodies that represent either all grant-maintained schools or LEAs. They, notoriously, are represented by more than one body for most purposes. In all conscience, I cannot promise that there will be extensive, open-ended and endless consultations by the FAS when it sets out its plans and objectives, in spite of the detailed guidance in the document. Consultation will be undertaken in the way that is normal for such a body. I ask the Committee to accept that it will be more than adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister spoke about public accountability, he referred to the accounting officer at the Department of Education. The amendment would not just guarantee that public money would be properly spent—that has to happen. We are also concerned about public accountability and the manner in which money would be spent. The Government notice the cost of everything and the value of nothing. There should not be just an accounting exercise. What that money brings has to be examined if there is to be public accountability for using public resources. There should not be just a book-keeping exercise. We would examine the service being delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments about the guide to non-departmental public bodies and how it will affect the operation of the Bill. Nothing was different under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which provides that the funding agency use resources in an efficient manner. The Minister's argument did not make the distinction between the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency not being subject to a body such as the Audit Commission will be a great problem. I sought to show when moving the amendment that, given its brief to achieve value for money and the efficient and effective use of public money, the Audit Commission helps agencies such as local education authorities achieve their objectives. I understand that the Audit Commission does not have the power that would cover a body such as the funding agency in its terms of reference. That is why we are concerned and believe that there has to be a requirement to ensure the efficient and effective use of public money. That is particularly important as an ever-decreasing amount of public money is dedicated to the education service. Between 1990 and 1991, it has lost 4,287 qualified teachers. That has affected class size and pupil-teacher ratios have worsened. Our view is that it would be detrimental to children's education if money were used inefficiently or ineffectively. That is why we shall put the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the amendments in this large group cover many different issues, we must examine the structure of the funding agency as well as its purpose. It is a shame that the Minister is in the middle of negotiations; it may be helpful for me to use these few moments to set the scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the part of the clause that deals with the work of the funding agency. It is fundamental to get right the structure of the agency at the outset. There seems to be some intellectual confusion on the part of the Minister. I shall return to that at a more convenient moment. Although the members of the agency are independent under clause 1, their scope for independent action is severely limited under clause 6, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) In exercising their functions each funding authority shall comply with any directions contained in an order made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It is obvious from the outset that the agency operates within a restricted brief. At any time the Secretary of State can override the agency or at least demand absolute adherence to his views. I am sure that the Committee will agree that if the Secretary of State is to be all-important, it is vital that the members of the funding agency should be of the highest quality so that they can offer the best possible advice to the Secretary of State who may, however, not always be around to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case members of the Committee think that that is merely fanciful meanderings, let me point out that although the Secretary of State was very visible at the beginning of the day, he disappeared almost completely from sight just when progress could have been made. I understand that he was due to attend a meeting, arranged some time ago, with the European Trade Union Committee for Education, whose members were absolutely astonished to discover a few hours before that meeting was due to begin that he had simply disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a Secretary of State whose whereabouts are difficult to determine, it is fundamental that the members of the funding agency are of the calibre to make decisions of the highest quality. Having established that, it is not necessary to dwell on the disappearing Secretary of State, except to point out that we are still looking for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may recall our discussions about flexibility to allow the Secretary of State to be present. Presumably, he could not be here today because he had some function to fulfil. I wonder whether he has been struck down with a serious illness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, I place on the record the Opposition's condolences to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have gone far enough on that. May we now return to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir John, because I feared that I was straining my own patience, never mind yours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was necessary to give the Minister opportunities for his own consulations. I do not say that with any malice. In the Secretary of State's absence, he has to liaise with the Whips to find out what is going on. The Minister challenged the Opposition to say whether we wanted to speak on behalf of parents or to represent narrow producer interests. He said that the amendments sought to involve in the consultation process people with experience in education. The words "narrow producer interests" have a perjorative ring and were not intended as a compliment to people with experience and knowledge of education. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Paragraph 3.7 of the White Paper deals with the changing nature of schools and refers to the Government's hope for an increased number of opted-out schools. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Against this background, the Government will legislate to set in place a new and evolutionary framework for the organisation of schools in England. The framework will be designed:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>to develop flexibility, area by area, in response to local circumstances and parental demand:</li>
	<li>to permit powers and responsibilities to be devolved to individual schools to the maximum extent practicable;</li>
	<li>to vest in a statutory national body responsibility for distributing grant to GM schools and for financial monitoring; and</li>
	<li>to provide for that body to take on wider planning responsibilities, as the proportion of pupils in GM schools in a given area increases." </li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to that first aspect:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to develop flexibility, area by area, in response to local circumstances and parental demand;"</p></blockquote>
The White Paper emphasises the need for flexibility and for the funding agency to be responsive to local circumstances. Paragraph 3·8 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To meet these objectives, the Government proposes to establish a new statutory body to be known as the Funding Agency for Schools. It will have 10–15 members appointed by the Secretary of State, drawn from various backgrounds to reflect a broad mix of educational and other experience. A substantial number of the members will come from outside education, including key appointments from the industrial and commercial worlds. It will be important that some members should have experience of maintained, including voluntary, schools."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to outline the role of the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper considers only briefly how the membership of the funding agency should be constituted. The White Paper and the Bill tell us little about what is in the minds of the Secretary of State and the Minister about the funding agency. The purpose of the amendments is to allow the Minister to place on record his views about how the funding agency will reflect the different inputs. Whatever arguments the Minister may advance against the amendments, the way in which the agency operates is essential to the future of primary and secondary education, although it is broader than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is offensive for the Minister to talk about "narrow producer interests". It is offensive even to the Secretary of State, who accepts the need for the agency's membership to reflect broad educational and other experience. Even the Secretary of State believes that the so-called "narrow producer interests" should be represented. For those reasons, the Minister should admit that his views were over the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shows a lack of grasp of the purpose of the Bill when he claims that it puts parents in positions of power. In the Government's view, the role of parents in the opting-out process has already been enshrined. Parents of a particular generation have a right to take part in the initial ballot. Parents are represented on the governing body of any school. The Bill does not, therefore, give more power to parents. It seeks to establish a control mechanism through the funding agency, which will correct the big dificiencies in the Education Reform Act 1988. That has nothing to do with parent power. How can the Committee ensure that the measure, which effectively nationalises the education system, provides for a national body that reflects the diversity of the community and the education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
world? If we achieved that, the funding agency could do a proper job as a funding mechanism and, as time goes by, it could accept the wider planning responsibilities that the White Paper mentions and which are implicit in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that he wanted to make progress. The constitution of the funding agency is central to the Bill's impact on education. The Minister rightly urged us on to discuss the amendments, which are important to the future of the funding agency. I understand that the Government Whip will allow us to discuss the amendments at length. The Opposition welcome that and we want to use the time wisely. The Minister should not be reluctant to answer fully the important questions raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54, together with amendment No. 55, would increase the size of the funding agency. There is no right or wrong size. If we are seriously attempting to represent the broad range of views held by people in the world of education and outside it—the White Paper talks about other experience and key appointments from the industrial and commercial world—the committee must be large enough to accept contributions from people with expertise in differing subjects. I hope that the Minister will accept that the attempt to enlarge the committee is not an Opposition device. The size of a Committee that will represent the existing range of opinion that the Secretary of State believes should be available to the funding agency is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State used a form of words that implies that he wants to draw from a broad range of expertise, but the construction of the Bill narrows that range. How is suitability for membership of the funding agency denned in the Bill? Clause 1(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In opposing the members of the agency the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of including—
	<ol>
	<li>persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, the provision of primary or secondary education or to have held, and to have shown capacity in, any position carrying responsibility for the provision of such education, and</li>
	<li>persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters or the practice of any profession."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The real difficulty with an agency constructed on that basis is that the resources from which membership can be drawn are severely limited. The clause allows people with backgrounds in primary or secondary education to be recruited, but excludes people with any other background. It does not appear to give the Secretary of State any great flexibility, although it does mean that people with industrial, commercial or financial backgrounds will be eligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the hon. Gentleman. The aim of the clause is to rule nobody out. It suggests people who may have desirable experience, but it does not preclude or exclude the appointment of others. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me assure the Minister that I am aware that he has tried to be helpful on some occasions. I accept that this is one of those occasions, and I am pleased that that is how the Secretary of State intends the clause to be understood. I hope that the Minister will accept that by specifying in the Bill that some people will be included, the Government run the risk of implying that other people are
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
not deemed to be important. The purpose of the amendments is to establish that there are other groups of people whose backgrounds could be helpful to the funding agency. The Minister implied that he accepts the overall logic in including in the Bill the groups of people specified in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make the point that this anxiety is not felt only by Opposition Members. I imagine that the Minister is one of those who thinks that the Church of England is rather liberal and trendy, and that he may not take its opinion too seriously. That is a matter for him, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth belongs to a much more direct tradition. Whether I can get the Minister and my hon. Friend to being a dialogue between the faiths remains to be seen, but the Church of England, in its comments on the White Paper, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the FAS increasingly takes on responsibility for strategic planning it will need to know local views and some structure will be needed through which these can be expressed."</p></blockquote>
If we are to consider structures through which local views can be expressed, it is important to have mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that we shall discuss regional structures—something that was explicit in the White Paper, though it is not explicit in the Bill. There is concern about the composition of the funding agency and about whether it can represent the diversity of views that we want to build into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church of England is not, of course, the only body to have such worries. Others, include the National Curriculum Council, which has made its own comments about the way in which matters will be dealt with either through the grant-maintained structure or the funding agency. The NCC makes a serious criticism of the Bill, but it is one that could be dealt with through the membership of the funding agency. The document, dated 5 November, refers to the council's publications and points out that when "Choice and Diversity" was published, the NCC welcomed the Government's commitment to
	<br><blockquote><p>"keep under review parents' channels of complaint and rights of redress if they are dissatisfied".</p></blockquote>
It continues to say that in September the NCC published "When Things Go Wrong at School", a review of redress procedures, which made several suggestions about how the Government could make it easier for parents and young people to complain. It then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We regret that, in a Bill establishing a new framework for the organisation and funding of schools, the government has missed the opportunity to build in from the start measures extending the right of parents and pupils to complain about problems with schooling."</p></blockquote>
I am not quoting at full length. It might be instructive for the Committee if I were to do so in future, but I do not have time this evening. The NCC make the point that the complaint procedure for grant-maintained schools is defective because the link with the local authority is missing. There is no mechanism involving the democratically elected representatives on the council. All that will be left will be what the NCC regards as the inadequate recourse to sections 68 and 99 of the Education Act 1944. The NCC says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill creates a Funding Agency for Schools whose task is to service grant-maintained schools. We suggest that the Funding Agency for Schools should be given responsibility for handling the complaints of parents and others dissatisfied with the way their case has been dealt with by the governing body of a grant-maintained school."</p></blockquote>
It continues, under the heading "Complaining about the Funding Agency for Schools":
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are disappointed that people who want to complain about the Funding Agency for Schools will have to use sections 68 and 99 of the 1944 Act. For the reasons given above, the effect of the Bill will be to make it almost impossible for consumers to hold the Funding Agency to account."</p></blockquote>
The NCC sees the approach to complaints set out in sections 68 and 99 as deficient in that it means direct recourse to the Secretary of State. I am not sure whether the NCC is concerned that the Secretary of State is simply not around and that he will not therefore be in a position to deal with their complaints or whether they simply do not have confidence that the Secretary of State will be in a position to deal with the full range of complaints. They are very keen that the funding agency for schools should perform the task of receiving and determining complaints about opted out schools. I think that there is merit in the idea. We need a clear and well-understood line of communication for a complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the amendments build in a complaints procedure—that comes in a different part of the Bill—but the membership of the agency is fundamental to the people's confidence that it can operate properly as a complaints mechanism. That is not implicit in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, the Minister gave the game away about the agency and spoke with what seemed to be genuine passion. It is rare for me to accuse the Minister of passion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was venom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have never experienced it, my hon. Friends say that they are more used to the Minister's venom. I have always regarded him as a man who is easily aroused to passion. I dealt with him on several previous occasions when he was a Minister at the Department of Employment. It is nice to see his passion coming to the surface and it is good to see a Minister who cares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does he care about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks what he cares about. I am not able to answer that question. The Minister is adamant that the agency will be accountable—he stressed that word. I was tempted, in the debate on the previous amendment to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend that the Minister had convinced me of his good intentions and that I would have to vote against the amendment. That was until the Minister said rather less passionately that the agency would be accountable only in a financial and operational sense. Sadly, that is when the game was blown. The agency is solely about financial and operational matters, not about the broader issues of representation and accountability in a broad and diverse society. It is important to tempt the Minister to express his well-known leanings towards a passionate approach to politics. He sees himself as a conviction politician, like Baroness Thatcher—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that he is of that school and does not hold the more laid-back views of some on the Committee such as the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education, who is not a conviction politician, thoroughly decent man though he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is statesmanlike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he is. If I can persuade the Under-Secretary to answer my questions in a little more detail, I shall be extremely grateful. I may speak to him about it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Nigel Forman)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tell the hon. Gentleman, in a spirit of reconciliation, that even laid-back Ministers have convictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced of the Minister's convictions. If he can also convince me that he will answer my questions, I will be assured of his convictions and do little else in the Committee than proclaim his merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government see the agency as being about the delivery of finance and are convinced that it will be efficient and well structured. It is important, however, for the agency to develop a flexible response to local circumstances, which will be important when it is involved in the wider planning responsibilities foreseen by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established that we seek to broaden access to the agency because amendment Nos. 54 and 55 allow for slightly broader membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go out of sequences and deal with amendments Nos. 24 and 26 because they are of considerable importance. They refer to the words in the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons who appear to him"—</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have experience of</p></blockquote>
various matters. The problem is the fact the appointment depends on how the person appears to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee wish to ensure genuine representation on the agency. The Minister of State, Welsh Office is paying particular attention because in Wales a different line was taken. A much more conciliatory approach was adopted to construct a council that will be drawn geographically broadly and will attempt to be a little more representative. My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) may have specific comments on that, and I do not wish to be drawn into Welsh politics or the needs of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency is to be genuinely credible and is to consist of people with the experience that the Bill claims, we must not allow the Secretary of State to operate in that highly subjective fashion. We have become used to quangos being appointed by Secretaries of State who, through different Acts of Parliament, can choose people from certain backgrounds and capacities. On almost every occasion those people also happen to be members of the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says "shame". In a pluralist and democratic society, it is not automatically a shame to be a member of the Conservative party, but it would be for me if I or members of my family were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one asked the hon. Gentleman to join.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says there has been no invitation. I have been told that I may be blackballed. I shall ponder possibility for a moment. However, if an invitation were to arrive, I would not want to join even if that were a necessary qualification for me to be offered a place on the funding agency for schools, on my local health authority or on one of the Tory party front organisations that, sadly, litter our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
Our experience of Government-appointed bodies in health, industry or education that are under the direct influence of a Secretary of State is that the decaying hand of over-ideological Secretaries of State seeks to deaden any dissent. They simply wish to appoint place men and women who will do their bidding. That is why it is important to strike from the Bill the words, "appear to him", meaning to the Secretary of State. That would force the Secretary of State to account for those that he appoints so that it is not just by appearance but by common understanding that the appointees have adequate educational or industrial experience. It think that the former Secretary of State for Wales has been appointed to the National Rivers Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not good enough. My hon. Friend knows far more about the Water Act 1989 than I do, but that appointment says something about the qualifications of those who hold important positions with the National Rivers Authority. I fear that the words "appear to the Secretary of State" must have been in that Act. A former Secretary of State for Wales was appointed by another Secretary of State in the same Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point, but it is an important issue, and not just to us as a politicised Opposition. I freely admit that that is what we are. Many people feel that decisions made by bodies corrupted by this process are not to be trusted. I shall give an example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) recently met with North Western regional health authority to discuss a hospital closure. He was told that the only decision that the health authority had to make was whether the hospital had to close on accounting grounds. My hon. Friend tried to make the point to the regional health authority chairman that that was unreasonable. He could not persuade the Secretary of State-appointed chairman because, I fear, the chairman saw his role as servicing the needs of the Secretary of State rather than those of my region. We cannot allow that to happen with the funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FAS will be involved with funding and with schools closing or remaining open, it would be outrageous if decisions were made because an under-funding agency saw its role as mechanically implementing the needs of the Secretary of State rather than the scholastic needs of communities. Under clause 6 the Secretary of State has absolute power and the reach, on every occasion, to squash dissent from the agency. In a healthy democratic society it should be accepted that appointing people with independence of view is not a matter of Committee rhetoric but fundamental to the future behaviour of the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not exclusive and I hope that the Minister recognises the merit in that approach. Over the years, those Conservative Members who believe that they cannot lose have become arrogant. There may be a day when there is a Secretary of State from another party who can appoint placemen and placewomen. Conservative Members would do us all a favour if they would accept the logic of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) of all people would not be tempted to appoint
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
placemen, but Conservative Members should not trust her with the power to do so, just as I do not trust the Secretary of State—much as I respect him—with his awesome responsibilities. Specifically, I do not trust him with appointments to the funding agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he is still Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, we are not certain whether we still have a Secretary of State, because it may be that he will befall a terrible accident. I do not trust the Secretary of State, and would not trust even the Minister, if he were called upon to replace him, to do the job without giving in to the temptations which afflict some of us. It is important that we limit the power of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 would delete clause 1(3). Our replacement subsection would not restrict the Secretary of State to appointing people with expertise in primary and secondary education. It would allow him to appoint people with primary and secondary education experience, people with expertise in further education, special needs education and the provision of education and those who have experience of industry, commerce and financial matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that those people who have experience in industry, commerce and finance have been included because the Secretary of State and the Minister are insistent that there should be people from a trade union background. It is their way of ensuring that there would be active trade unions on the funding agency. It is a ploy—almost a ministerial jest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording says, "shown capacity in", which might rule out most of those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is worried, I know of several trade unionists who have considerable capacity in certain areas of life. If the Minister wants a list of relevant people, I shall be happy to furnish with him names of those who would be capable of serving on the funding agency. Even wearing the Minister's former Department of Employment hat, he must have met many such people over the years who abused him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had many submissions from people involved in special needs education. I shall restrict myself to quoting from a couple of them. Members on both sides of the Committee may wish to raise the point of special needs education; on Second Reading it was raised by several Conservative members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the area of special needs have written to all Committee members on the importance of including their area explicitly in the Bill. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen to include the point about special needs education. As members will know, Deaf Accord is a consortium of charities, including the National Deaf Children's Society and Sense, the National Deaf-Blind and Rubella Association—the leading UK organisations for deaf and deaf-blind children and their families. Those organisations do not merely represent narrow, producer interests, but are organisations concerned about parents because they directly represent them—perhaps more directly than other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deaf Accord has gone through a list of concerns that it has about the effect of the Bill on special needs education. It raises questions about the Bill, such as who would be responsible for ensuring that there is local provision? Deaf Accord states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the considerable strides that have been made in terms of the education of deal children over recent years have been due to the driving force and dynamism of Support Service for Hearing Impaired Children. Recent research by the National Deaf Children's Society indicates that there is a direct correlation between parental satisfaction and strong responsive support services."</p></blockquote>
The Minister placed importance on the fact that the Bill is about parents and about children in schools. I emphasise the point made by the parent-driven group of the correlation between parental satisfaction and stong responsive support services. It continues to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current proposals contained in this Bill will make it impossible for these Support Services"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a great deal of conversation occurring. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can be heard in silence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My throat was getting a little dry: I have remedied that. Deaf Accord correlates parental satisfaction and strong responsive support services and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current proposals contained in this Bill will make it impossible for these Support Services to continue to play their essential role in ensuring good special educational provision for deaf children."</p></blockquote>
The Minister dealt with that point cursorily on Second Reading. In replying to the debate, the Minister should respond to the specific anxieties of Deaf Accord and other organisations that represent people who work with those who have special educational needs. He should reassure them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may not be able to do that. The funding agency will not be directly responsible for the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. Local education authorities will continue to be responsible. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman imports such issues into our debate. That is a matter for you, Sir John. I shall not respond to his point, because it is not germane to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me show you, Sir John, that you are right. I always support your decisions fully. I shall try to explain to the Minister what you and I know, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deaf Accord may not have mentioned the membership of the funding agency directly, but what about the Spastics Society? Does the Minister believe that it is an illegitimate voice of parents? A close relative was involved with the forerunner of the Spastics Society through his child. I do not accept that the Spastics Society does not represent the interests of parents and children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that organisations such as Deaf Accord, the Spastics Society, Mencap and other voluntary and charitable bodies, which work to ensure that children with disabilities that they need to overcome are properly cared for, fear that, while statemented children will come within the orbit of local authority responsibility, many children who do not have statements, and may be in grant-maintained schools, may not get the help and support that they need. The Bill does not provide for that. That is why amendment No. 54 is so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He sums up the anxieties of many organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Minister's arguments against the amendments, I am genuinely surprised that he does not understand that it is not the Opposition who have initiated the demand for a role for special needs education on the funding agency, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly says that the consumers initiated the demand. Does the Minister believe that the Spastics Society does not represent consumers? Perhaps he believes that such an organisation is another narrow, producer interest. If he pursues that argument, some Conservative Members many not support him, and he will totally alienate the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Spastics Society's submission to the Committee includes a section that is entitled "Membership of the FAS and SFC":
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Spastics Society urges that the welfare of children with special educational needs necessitates at the very least the inclusion of members with expertise in the special education field."</p></blockquote>
The representatives of children with special needs appeal to the Minister. The least he can do is to include people with expertise in special educational need in the membership of the agency. This is not a trivial point. It is of great concern to those involved in special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) made considerable play of this matter on Second Reading. I heard and read later what he said with considerable interest; it was a sensitive speech. I am not saying that just because I want to persuade him to vote with us—which I do. He must accept that there was logic in his submissions to the Minister on Second Reading about special needs. When groups representing children with special needs are so adamant about representational rights in the funding agency, their points have to be answered satisfactorily and not dismissed as being of no importance. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 seek to extend the agency explicitly to include people with experience of special needs education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another part of amendment No. 23 requires the inclusion of one or more people with a background in further education. It is good that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education is present. The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 is now in effect. Many people fear chaos in post-16 education. Ministers may dismiss that and say that they do not see matters developing in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a massive explosion of groups involved in the post-16 structure. There are at least five different statutory bodies. Even the most casual view of that area of education would reveal that it is vital to the future of the nation. Whatever views separate hon. Members on different sides of the Committee, both the major political parties and, in fairness to them, the minor parties, too, have laid emphasis on the importance of post-16 education and training. The Government are spending considerable amounts of taxpayers' money on training—as Baroness Thatcher used to remind us—although I think that they are spending it badly. They are also spending considerable amounts of taxpayers' money on further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last week's autumn statement the Government announced what they claimed to be a major new central Government initiative. It was a major new initiative only in the sense that it displaced what local authorities had previously done. What is of interest to me is whether the Minister can convince me that more is being spent by central Government than was previously spent by local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the plans set out in the autumn statement show the possibility of a 25 per cent. increase in funding for further education in the next three years matched by a 25 per cent. increase in student numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to the debate on further education on another occasion, but I think that it would strain your patience, Sir John, if I discussed that subject now. I invite the Minister to ensure that we have a proper debate on further education because it is fundamental to the future of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not certain from the answers that I received to my parliamentary questions whether the Government know what was spent in the past. It is incredible that they have not made efforts to find out what local authorities were spending. Perhaps the Minister and I can take that up on a different occasion. I think that he would agree—conviction politician that he is—that it is important that our convictions are informed by reliable and adequate information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
There is a plethora of statutory bodies for post-16 education. The Further Education Funding Council has been established and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and I have just discussed its role. The funding agency will have responsibility for post-16 education at schools, sixth-form colleges and sixth-form centres. The local education authorities will maintain their role in that for a long time. The TECs were established for vocational education, but they are major players in post-16 education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
