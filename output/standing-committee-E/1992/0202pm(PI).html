	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 852, in page 117, line 37, leave out from beginning to 'after' in line 26 on page 118 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'In section 12 of the Education Act 1980 (establishment and alteration of county schools)'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 853 to 890.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that there are a large number of Government amendments and I apologise to the Committee for that. However, their essence can be stated fairly simply and straightforwardly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments reflect the further consideration that we have given to the proposals in the White Paper to give local education authorities the power to bring forward proposals to make a significant change of character or significant enlargement of voluntary schools. On Second Reading, we said that we were always prepared to listen carefully to representations. I am sure that all members of the Committee welcome that as they have constantly urged it on my hon. Friends and me since we started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that concerns have been expressed to us about that radical departure from what has been the previously established policy, so we decided to table the amendments. Their effect will be to remove the provision from clause 205 that local education authorities should be able to propose the significant change of character or significant enlargement of the premises of a voluntary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As amended, the provisions give the Secretary of State new powers, were school places in the area are excessive, to direct the governing body of a voluntary school to make proposals for the significant change of character or significant enlargement of the school under section 13 of the Education Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will also have the power to direct the governing body of a voluntary school to bring forward proposals for the alteration of the school at stage 3 where the provision of places in an area is not sufficient. Our commitment to the removal of surplus places remains unchanged, but there are varying views about the best way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1272</span>
to achieve this. The clause as amended will ensure that the voluntary sector does not stand in the way of sensible reorganisation proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the local education authority will be free to bring any desirable changes to the Secretary of State's attention, and he will be able to consider the overall situation in the area before deciding whether or not it is necessary to direct a voluntary school to bring forward proposals. If the Secretary of State decides that the governing body of a voluntary school should be directed to bring forward proposals under section 13 of the 1980 Act for a change of character—but not religious character—or enlargement, the proposals will require the approval of the Secretary of State, who may reject them, approve them without modification or, after consultation with the persons by whom they were made, and the LEA, approve them with modifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with a direction under clause 207 to the LEA or the funding agency for schools, if the time allowed under the order expires and no proposals have been made by the governing body of the school, the Secretary of State may make his own proposals for the change of character or enlargement of the school. If any objections to the Secretary of State's proposals are made by those who are listed as statutory objectors, including the local education authority concerned, the governing body of the school and those responsible for the appointment of the foundation governors, the proposals will be subject to the public inquiry procedure outlined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments balance the competing claims of those who would seek to give LEAs complete control over voluntary schools and those who would give voluntary schools complete autonomy regardless of the overall situation in the area. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am still somewhat puzzled by the amendments. I am not even sure that clause 205 is necessary. What difference would it make if the clause were omitted? It seems to me that it would make none at all. I am also unhappy with what the Minister said about the change in emphasis—that voluntary-aided schools will now be accountable directly to the Secretary of State. Like the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), I have always been in favour of subsidiarity, which is good Catholic doctrine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am no theologian, but I thought that good Catholic doctrine was based on the infallibility of the person at the top.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Minister thoroughly misunderstands the doctrine of infallibility. The present Secretary of State claims more infallibility than Popes have for centuries. The doctrine of infallibility, is limited precisely by subsidiarity, as the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will explain to him. A correct interpretation of infallibility shows that subsidiarity would mean that the local church and local bishops should hold sway, along with the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particularly disturbing aspect of the Bill can be found in schedule 14, which deals with the appointment of governors of voluntary-aided schools. Schedule 14 for the first time will cause governors appointed by the LEA and the Secretary of State to outweigh the foundation body's governors. That will set a very dangerous precedent, no matter how saintly the Secretary of State or the LEA may be. A principle is at stake, and the problem that it represents will be difficult to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1273</span>
Strangely, it seems that LEAs will still have to contribute their governors' share to capital schemes. If that is so—and I trust that the Minister will correct me if it is not—it seems all the stranger that such schemes should be directed by the Secretary of State. I should add that the biggest problem facing Anglican and Catholic voluntary-aided schools is that there is too much, rather than too little, demand for them. There is therefore not much of a practical problem and the Secretary of State will not get involved. Again, however, an important principle is at stake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That latter comment is absolutely correct. The whole thrust of this part of the Bill is that we would normally expect the bodies responsible for the provision of places to produce appropriate proposals. Those bodies would be the LEAs, where they continue to have a role, the funding agency for schools, where it begins to have a role, and—crucially for this debate—the governing bodies of the voluntary-aided schools. However, we believe that the Secretary of State should have an important reserve power. If appropriate actions are not taken, especially when tackling surplus places provision, he should be able to step in and make suitable arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) that experience shows that voluntary sector provision is oversubscribed and suffers from overdemand. However, surplus capacity in voluntary schools is not unknown. Voluntary schools may contribute to a problem of surplus places in an area. It is, therefore, appropriate to allow the governing bodies to present proposals. If they do not, the Secretary of State must step in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister knows that some schools within the Catholic sector that are threatened with reorganisation to remove surplus capacity, have .said to Bishops, "If you do that, we'll go grant maintained." That has been said—let us be honest about it. I do not say that simply because I oppose grant-maintained schools. I hope that the Secretary of State will take account of my point when he considers under-provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but let us keep this in proportion. A school cannot simply declare that it will become grant maintained. It can say that it will persuade the governors that grant-maintained status is a good idea. The governors will then allow parents to ballot so that they can decide whether it is a good idea. The application for grant maintained status will ultimately be presented to the Secretary of State who will decide, given all the local circumstances, whether to accept the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind that the threat, "Do that and we'll go grant maintained" is empty and irresponsible. I hope that the hon. Gentleman takes it with a pinch of salt. Becoming grant maintained is one of the most important steps that a school can take. Such a decision can be made only after the carefully-modulated series of steps that I described have been taken. Approval will be given only if the local educational circumstances are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the matter in context and try to reassure the hon. Member for Hemsworth. We recognise the understandable anxieties of the Church. We try to preserve the balance that the Church acknowledges has been in place since the Education Act 1944. The relationship
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1274</span>
between LEAs and churches has worked fairly satisfactorily. The amendments would maintain the balance and not disturb it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as originally drafted, would have changed considerably the relationship between authorities and the churches. The amendments will restore that balance, while retaining an important reserve role for the Secretary of State if diocesan schools, the funding agency for schools or LEAs cannot or will not make proper provision of places. That includes dealing with surplus places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On numerous occasions the Committee has discussed the additional and centralising powers that will be given to the Secretary of State as a result of the Bill's provisions. For many of us, the power that will be given to him by clause 207 is probably the best illustration of the enormous extension of the Secretary of State's powers that will result from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is stark in its provisions. It says plainly that the Secretary of State will have the power by order to direct the local education authority or the funding agency to issue proposals to remove excess capacity in the school sector in a particular local authority area. The clause states that, in making such an order, the Secretary of State can lay down the principles that should be applied when the local authority or the funding agency presents proposals in response to that order. It would be helpful for the Committee to hear from the Minister examples of the considerations that will be covered by those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the clause gives the Secretary of State power by way of order. The order does not have to come back to Parliament, but can simply direct the local authority or the funding agency to make reorganisation proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 207 is carefully worded—the Secretary of State has ensured that the holder of his office will not be involved in any local controversy. The order will direct the local authority and will not name individual schools. That will be the difficult task of the funding agency or the local education authority. Those of us who, in a previous political life, were responsible for piloting through reorganisation proposals involving the closure or merger of schools know all too well the political difficulties and the local hostility to which such proposals give rise. I understand why the Secretary of State does not want the holder of his office to be involved in such arguments.

It is unfair that the Secretary of State can, by order, require reorganisation proposals to be made, but will not specify the schools that are to be the subject of such proposals. He will take a broad-brush approach, while the funding agency or the LEA will do the detailed work and will put proposals before the Secretary of State. That procedure requires clarification. First, how will the Secretary of State identify a surplus or excess capacity in a particular local authority area? The figure of 1·5 million surplus places in England has been bandied around in Committee. The Minister has said that there are up to 1·5 million. That is a large number: I recollect that it first came from the Audit Commission. We should be clear in our own minds about how that figure is to be calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the autumn, the Department for Education estimated the surplus capacity in individual LEA areas. It was a difficult exercise, especially for local authorities. In the consultation document, the Department's estimate of surplus capacity seemed to be based on two separate methods of calculation. One method used the more open enrolment capacity formula, and the second calculation was based on the school's actual standard number, which was multiplied by the number of age groups to produce an estimated capacity for the school as a whole. Those two formulae give different figures for local authorities. The calculation of the number of surplus places must be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1277</span>
One local authority reported that under one formula it would have to implement a reduction of 8,730 places, involving the closure of seven or eight schools; but under the other formula it would have to build three extra schools because there would be a deficit of 3,310 places. That is why we need a clear illustration of how excess capacity will be calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members see some merit in flexibility and in having surplus capacity in the system. Clearly a surplus of 1·5 million is untenable and indefensible; we do not need that degree of over-capacity. But if all the 1·5 million surplus places were removed, thousands of schools in England and Wales would be closed. The Minister should tell the Committee whether the Secretary of State wants thousands of schools in England and Wales to close. If he moves to require local authorities or the funding agency to remove up to 1·5 million surplus places, that will be the consequence. The Minister should make his intentions clear today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 207 is unacceptable because in practice it will make local authorities and, indeed, the funding agency the mere tools of the Secretary of State. He will be able to require them by order to remove excess capacity. That is not an appropriate way of achieving an objective that we share—surplus places are not good for the system; they are inefficient, a waste of valuable resources and they need to be taken out. Diktat by the Secretary of State as provided for by the clause is inappropriate even in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the clause and the effect that the rationalisation of local authorities for which it provides will have on class sizes. LEAs currently fund teacher staffing on the basis of authority-wide pupil-teacher ratios. Those are increasing at present. However, the pupil-teacher ratio does not adequately reflect actual class sizes. Since local management of schools and the allocation of school budgets by governors, and since the introduction of the national curriculum, schools have been reallocating their resources. That reallocation, coupled with cuts in education resources, has caused the national pupil-teacher ratio to increase. Falling school rolls over the years made it possible for class sizes to be reduced to more acceptable levels, which would have undoubtedly led to improved educational standards. Sad to say, that opportunity has been missed, as the decline in pupil numbers has been used to reduce public expenditure. Class sizes continue to increase, not decrease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than searching for so-called surplus places, which will increase class sizes, now that we have the national curriculum and the national assessment of pupils we should have nationally agreed limits on class sizes. Because we do not have such limits, we have a wide variation in the class sizes of pupils of the same age. Removing surplus places from one school will probably have a knock-on effect in another school in that local education authority area. Before surplus places are removed, therefore, the details of such a knock-on effect should be published by the relevant authority, so that the effect of the removal of places is known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If every child is to have equal opportunity, every child must have equal conditions in which to work. One child being taught in classes of over 30—and sometimes over 40—pupils, while another is taught in classes of fewer than 30
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1278</span>
pupils does not give the two of them an equal opportunity. Many children are disadvantaged in that way early in their educational career. The average class size in a primary school in England is approximately 25·5, but many children throughout the country are in classes of well over 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department for Education's figures show huge discrepancies. In Cheshire, for example, 43 per cent. of primary school classes have more than 30 pupils, yet the figure in Nottinghamshire is 18 per cent. That shows a huge discrepancy in the shire counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attempting to make a political point; for my examples I have taken the highest and lowest figures, whether they refer to authorities controlled by the Conservatives, by Labour or by the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the urban districts: 43·4 per cent. of classes in Trafford have more than 30 pupils, yet the figure is only 8 per cent. in Gateshead. In London, 56·4 per cent. of primary classes in Redbridge have more than 30 pupils, whereas the figure is just 2·4 per cent. in Camden and Islington. Those examples show that children do not have an equal opportunity right at the beginning of their education career. There are even worse examples, in authorities ranging from Manchester to Merton and from Humberside to Hampshire, in which primary school children are in classes of more than 41 pupils. I insist that such children cannot get an education as good as that of children who are educated in classes of much smaller size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only do class sizes affect children's performance, they also affect teachers. Irrespective of whether the Government believe it, the large numbers in classes cause many teachers to feel very stressed and much more fatigued. They do not mind the extra work or trying to carry out the reforms, but that is so difficult when they have to teach classes of more than 30, and sometimes more than 40, pupils. The greater the number of children in the class, the more homework there is to mark and the more preparation needs to be done, so the work load increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all well and good looking for surplus places, but if that affects class sizes everywhere in an authority, the exercise is wrong because class size affects performance. I do not object to the Government seeking surplus places if they are there and it can be proved that their removal will not affect the education of other children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to cite a couple of Government examples, taken from recent Welsh Office figures. The average class size in Dyfed is 21 pupils, which is commendable. Top marks were achieved in that county. The results in other counties in Wales with greater class sizes were not as good as those in Dyfed. I am sure that that is because class sizes in Dyfed are smaller. In 1991, the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales produced key stage 1 statistics. It found
	<br><blockquote><p>"an increased likelihood of achievement at level 3 in small classes"—</p></blockquote>
that is, of up to 24 pupils. It also noted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a small decline in achievement with increasing class size".</p></blockquote>
It is quite clear that research shows that the number of children in a class affects the standards and the attainments of the children in the class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause should ensure that surplus places can be removed only if it does not affect class sizes in the rest of the authority, as that would affect the standard and quality of education for our children. Our common aim is to raise standards and we all wish to see results improve. However,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1279</span>
without suitable amendment to the clause, which allows the Secretary of State to take X number of surplus places out of the system without considering the knock-on effect, its consequences will be very dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend has already pointed out the big differences that can arise in the two different formulae used to determine whether there are surplus places in any local authority area. My hon. Friend the Member for the City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) has shown that class sizes differ throughout the country. In the case of classes with up to 40 pupils that is to the detriment of the children's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating clause 207, as amended, but despite the amendments we still do not know the Government's thinking on how surplus places should be treated. For example, would the Government accept that, before the Secretary of State becomes involved with the issue of surplus places locally, any one school should have about 10 per cent. of its desks empty to allow for variations in intake that may take place year by year? That would allow new pupils to come to the school and for parental choice. If every school had all the desks filled, there would be no parental choice other than that which may have been achieved up to the point that all the places were taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another case, a school may have more than 10 per cent. surplus places, but within its catchment area there may be a huge new housing development. How will the Department of Education take such localised factors into account when determining that a school or a local authority area has surplus places?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in sparsely populated rural counties, of which there are some in Wales, where the removal of surplus places might involve the closing of schools and children being required to make much longer journeys than they are accustomed to? Will transport considerations allow for any flexibility?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of secondary schools, will the Minister not just consider the position in a local authority area as it is in one year, but consider across the time span before deciding whether the secondary school or the local authority area has surplus places? The issue of building development is important. In inner cities and valley communities, where all the mines have closed, there is a steady downward movement in population, but in other areas—for example, along the coast in south Wales—there is a steady increase in population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some LEAs take in both types of area, so how will the Secretary of State apply flexibility in such cases? We should be given answers to some of those questions before we can feel confident about the part that the Secretary of State will play in—dare I say it—helping local authorities to come to terms with any surplus places which they might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a major disagreement on whether there were surplus places in an authority's area, and the Minister owes it to us to provide us with some understanding of how the Secretary of State might proceed to make the decisions that he must make before imposing such an order on a local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister may know that Suffolk county council has written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to express its concern about so-called surplus places in Suffolk. Apparently, the Department has used two different measures to calculate the number of surplus places in the county's schools. The standard numbers are based either on the number of pupils in a school or the number of places available. The method that the county council would obviously prefer is known as the "teaching areas" and is based on the accommodation available at a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department's figures would suggest that the county council has a surplus in Suffolk alone of 21,443 places in primary and secondary schools. However, the county has made second calculations based on the other method of measuring and finds that there are 15,753 surplus places. The officers of the county council have conducted a third exercise and suggest that there will be a shortfall of places by the year 2001 of about 3,725. Clearly, that matter needs to be clarified. I hope that the Minister can help us, if not at present then by letter afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited a primary school in Blundeston which had, as of yesterday morning, 99 children on its roll. On one measure of determining places in the school, it has 120 places, while on another it has 150 places. How can we take out even 20 or 30 surplus places in such a school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that we must make sure that all surplus places are truly surplus. A small teaching area between two classrooms in primary and middle schools may be technically surplus but, in practice, it is a necessary teaching aid. We must consider that carefully before any further decisions are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives us a welcome opportunity to discuss surplus places. In a sense, the hon. Member for Wallsend put his finger on the problem, for which I am grateful. He said that it was necessary to deal with surplus places. It is common ground between us that, if we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1281</span>
carrying an excessive number of school places in an area, that is a misuse of resources. We must find ways to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all authorities have shown that they wish to tackle the problem. Evidence has also shown that several authorities, even if they wish to deal with it, find it politically difficult to press ahead with what invariably leads to unpopular decisions. It is a little paradox of politics that democratic accountability, and the sensitivities of locally elected councillors to their electorate, mean that it is often extremely difficult for them to make unpopular decisions about closing schools, even when the relevant authority believes that that is necessary to deal with surplus places. An authority has asked me whether my Department and I would back it if it made such unpopular decisions. I said, "Of course. If there is agreement that the problem exists and that it should be tackled, you can expect our support."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That illustrates the difficulty of expecting democratically accountable local authorities always to make the tough decisions. Even if a school is grotesquely under-subscribed or more than half empty, parents often feel strongly about its proposed closure. That is the political background against which we must consider the problem. It can be tackled in several ways. Even as we speak, a dialogue is taking place between local authorities and my Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took time off from my onerous duties in Committee recently to meet distinguished representatives of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities to discuss the problem. We had a useful dialogue along lines that the hon. Member for Wallsend, who is not a stranger to that organisation, would recognise. We asked the AMA representatives whether up to 1·5 million surplus places had been identified. They said that they had been and referred to the exercise when they asked authorities to give in their returns, based admittedly on the criteria that we had outlined, on how many surplus places existed. We received the figures, examined them and went back to the authorities for verification, with the result that some adjustments were made. We are now in the process of examining the figures in more detail with the LEAs, to discover what they mean for different parts of the authorities' areas. We are in the process of asking questions, such as: what demographic information can we glean; and is the population increasing, static or on the decline? What is the impact of known local building developments? What is reasonably required to provide some parental choice, and what feasibly can be done to tackle the problem of surplus places, either in terms of individual schools or of a catchment area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process is still going on. Decisions and discussion do not take place in isolation. However, the clause makes it clear that, even though this is all going on, it is prudent for the Secretary of State to have a reserve power which can be used when LEAs, the funding agency for schools or, where appropriate, individual schools cannot come forward with reasonable and practical proposals to deal with a surplus place problem. It is surely right that the Secretary of State should able to make proposals or invite others to do so. Without such a power there would be a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1282</span>
real possibility, given the difficulties of the political process that I have described, that the problem would never be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a relevant time scale for this matter. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney that my Department and his authority can discuss whether the number of surplus places in his area is 20,000 or 15,000—but even the lower figure shows that there is much to be done. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said that we must look some way into the future; that is so, but we should not carry the number of surplus places that we have identified today eight or 10 years ahead—which is why I picked up on 2001—on the assumption that our projections of what the school population will be then are correct. That is where I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney—we may want to change the geographical disposition of schools to cope with different demands for education in the future that we cannot foresee now. While I agree that we can look three or four years ahead, it is not good policy to carry forward an identified number of surplus places to cover the possible demand for places in eight or 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be a legitimate difference of view between an authority that may want to take this approach and the Department for Education. It is a suitable matter for discussion, and I am prepared to examine it, although always with the reservation that while it is reasonable to look ahead, we should not go potty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend mentioned the figure of 10 per cent. That will also depend very much on circumstances. It may be highly desirable to allow a school to have about 10 per cent. spare capacity if it can show that its rolls have fluctuated in recent years, or that it is situated in an area of growth, or that it has recently changed its character in some way and can reasonably expect its numbers to increase. However, a school that for some time has been half or two thirds full, with no realistic prospect of more pupils, may not be suitable for carrying surplus capacity. In the end, it is likely—in fact, desirable—that the Department and local authorities will have to consider the problem of surplus places school by school to get the right answer. That is another part of the process that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reassure the Committee that we are not doctrinaire about this; we are not going to conduct some blind exercise based on arbitrary figures. It is a process which is underway, which will continue and which this clause will seek to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon.

Friend the Member for Wallsend. In my constituency, Devonport secondary school and St. Peter's Church of England school were due for reorganisation. The first plan was put forward by Devon county council way back in 1983. It had been subject to delays from the Minister's predecessors—on one occasion, 22 months elapsed before the proposal was turned down by the Secretary of State. Only now, in 1993—in September—will the reorganisation take place and one school be closed. The proposal has had the support of the community, the city council and the county council. Everybody has wanted the reorganisation to take place. The Government caused the delay which has cost Devon county council £500,000 every year since it began.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my as yet relatively brief experience in the Department, I can say that stories are rarely as simple or as black and white as that. There is usually a lot more to them than meets the eye. I will accept shared blame: although my Department is wonderful, it is not infallible and there may be undue delay on occasions. Nevertheless, I would rather have maximum dialogue and an exchange of views. That may take a long time, but if the hon. Member for Devonport believes that there are delays, I shall consider whether a decision can be made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1284</span>
that happens in the Department. Since this Secretary of State has been in charge of the Department such decisions have been made expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallsend asked what principles will inform the Secretary of State's approach to this matter. There will be a combination of propositions. We must ensure that there is a sufficient, but not excessive provision of places in each local authority area. We will want popular schools to expand in order to satisfy parental choice. If there is a perceived surplus capacity, the number of places should be reduced to a reasonable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain factors will have to be taken into account, such as demographics as far as they can be predicted and established, and local circumstances, which are always difficult because of the vexed issue of planning permissions granted and the problem of whether building work has started or not. We must be careful because occasionally schools have been built on the expectation of a new large housing estate which, in the event, is not built or is built but none of the houses are occupied and we are left with a large, empty school. We should be cautious even if it is expected to be a relatively straightforward matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not difficult to describe the broad criteria that will be brought to bear, but it is much more difficult to decide how to apply those principles to the local authority area and to the catchment area within that authority. I hope that I have said enough to persuade members of the Committee that we are taking a responsible, careful and cautious approach, that we are determined to help local authorities to deal with the problem of surplus places and that this reserve power for the Secretary of State is appropriate. I hope that the Committee will support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to intervene in this debate, but the Minister has demonstrated the problems that local authorities face when dealing with him on this issue. He wants to be reasonable. Having met those delegations, talked to people in schools affected and in local authorities, he now seems to understand the practical problems and the difficult decisions that must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a large measure of agreement because none of us wants unnecessary surplus capacity. We acknowledge that there must be a moderate amount of surplus capacity for the system to work and for there to be choice and flexibility. I am sure that the time that the Minister has spent meeting delegations—presumably because the Secretary of State was too busy to do so—has been well spent and has helped him to understand the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, however, has an unreasonable streak that comes out occasionally, which makes it difficult for us to accept his proposals. Although he acknowledges the difficulties experienced by local authorities and schools, he gives the impression that he and his Department's officials know best. The hon. Gentleman cannot accept the role that has been carried out by local authorities for many years, often satisfactorily, or that they can have a legitimate, different view from that of the Department for Education, and that they might occasionally be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency is to be superimposed on existing provisions. The Minister has not said much about how he or the Secretary of State will ensure a fair balance between the interests of schools that come under the responsibility of the funding agency and those that are in the local authority framework. When we tried to draw him out on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1285</span>
the powers of the funding agency, he repeated that schools should not be allowed to opt out just to avoid closure. He has never dealt with the possibility of there being an over-capacity in certain local authority areas of grant-maintained schools. Were there to be a reorganisation in Kent or Essex, GM schools could face closure because there has been a preponderance of such schools in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the funding agency and the local authority had not agreed to clamp the area, our residual worry is that the Minister may be tempted to favour grant-maintained schools rather than local authority schools. The hon. Gentleman talked about inviting others to come up with plans. I am not sure who "others" are, unless he was referring to the mushrooming of educational consultants. They may be the only beneficiaries of the Bill because it will provide them with more work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the overall thrust of the Bill is about the centralisation of all decision making in education, the Minister must realise that our worry about the clause and that of local authorities must be viewed in that context. Despite the hon. Gentleman showing, at times, his understanding of the problems, we have difficulty in accepting and entrusting what his reaction and that of the Secretary of State's would be in certain circumstances.

The Minister referred to his meeting with representatives of the AMA. I understand that he took on board some of their arguments. One of their suggestions was that, when a pattern of surplus places was acknowledged and an inquiry was to be carried out into what should happen, a moratorium on schools opting out should take place during that period. Such an approach is reasonable. What is the point of having all the disruption that will be caused by a school being grant maintained if there were to be an overall reorganisation of school places? Will the Minister explain his latest thinking on that suggestion by the AMA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I received a letter about that from the AMA only a few days ago. I have not been able to examine it and assess the practicality of the AMA's suggestion. It is an interesting idea, which I wish to consider. I have not yet been able to do justice to it, and I shall not be able to respond to the letter for some time. However, I do intend to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that. I am glad that his mind is not closed on the matter. He may have received the detailed letter only a few days ago, but he met the delegation several weeks ago. He has, therefore, had some time to consider the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a consensus that a problem with surplus places exists. However, we disagree about who should be responsible for devising a framework to tackle the problem. The Opposition believe that the best body to initiate proposals is the local authority. The Secretary of State seems determined to use the extra powers that the Bill gives him to impose his wishes on local authorities. Often, he will have to choose between GM and LEA schools at a time of reorganisation. The Opposition cannot trust his judgment or support his extra powers in that context. The Minister has tried to reassure us that he understands part of the problem, but we are not reassured that he has the right solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on the clause's relevance to Wales. The Under-Secretary of State for Schools is not in a position to reply to some of the detailed points that I may raise. Perhaps the Minister of State, Welsh Office will respond to them, since they are relevant to the clause and to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury about the AMA. The AMA has suggested that a moratorium be placed on opting out during examination of a reorganisation proposal, to enable dispassionate consideration. All the county councils in Wales are uncertain about reorganisation proposals. It costs £23 million a year to maintain surplus places. In Gwent alone, £13 million could be saved. Two of the three schools that have opted out in Wales are in Gwent. They opted out because they objected to closure under reorganisation proposals to tackle surplus places. Yet the Secretary of State himself had directed Gwent to tackle reorganisation. Every time a county council presents proposals to deal with surplus places, schools can apply to the Secretary of State for grant-maintained status. The Secretary of State is desperate for schools to opt out, and he will approve the applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to get away with that. He knows only too well about Queens school in Newport, which was subject to a closure proposal and applied to opt out. The application was rejected and the school was closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. But the Minister will recall that Cwmcarn school in the constituency of Islwyn was allowed to remain open. Before the Minister claims that that happened because my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock) requested that it remain open, I must tell him that my right hon. Friend asked for the school to be reorganised differently, not in the way suggested by the county council. In the league table published recently by the Welsh Office, that school was bottom of the list for Wales and bottom of the list for the United Kingdom. It was allowed to remain open simply to make a political point. The results could be seen in the national newspapers of Wales, in headlines such as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"County stymied by Hunt's school plan",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pouring money into empty desks".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State has dismissed the idea of considering dispassionately, using the principles that we were supposed to discuss today, the way in which schools will be reorganised because of surplus places. The Government are only anxious about schools opting out in the areas that are suffering from the results of surplus places.

If that is to be the Welsh Office's principle for dicsussing reorganisation plans, there is no point in local education authorities going to all the trouble of preparing plans and sending them to the Welsh Office or the Department for Education. The most important issue to emerge from our debate is the moratorium on opt-outs. If that is accepted, proper plans could be discussed correctly when the reorganisation proposals are considered. That would remove the issue from the hands of politicians and put it back in the hands of those who care about education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave away his own case when he described the position in Cwmcarn school in Gwent. He said that he argued for the school's retention, as did the right hon. Member for Islwyn, on the basis that there could be a different kind of reorganisation to get rid of surplus places. That is surely the main message for any authority. We want to get rid of surplus places; as the hon. Gentleman has just said, they cost about £23 million in unnecessary expenditure in Wales. However, there are ways of going about dealing with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the grant-maintained schools in Wales were subject to closure proposals by the local authority, but under the Education Reform Act 1988 there is a proper procedure for considering the position when an application for grant-maintained status is made simultaneously with a closure proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may not be able to use the school to which the Minister referred as an example, but as we have moved from Newport to Islwyn, let us move a few more miles up the valley, to Brynmawr. The same county put forward a similar reorganisation proposal. There was no question of the local Member of Parliament intervening on behalf of the school, yet a highly sensible plan was put forward for north Gwent, under which the schools would be reorganised in an area not just with surplus places but with a fall in population, with one further education college and some comprehensive schools. Once again, the school objected, applied to the Welsh Office and was allowed to opt out. Every single time a reorganisation proposal is put forward, the Welsh Office gives the school grant-maintained status. Will that stop, or will it continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We touched on the matter in the Committee's proceedings a few weeks ago which seems a lifetime ago. For many years, community use of schools has been accepted, has worked well and has been encouraged by local authorities and the Sports Council. However, the Bill and, in particular, the schedule, put at risk all that has been achieved. The Bill is insufficiently precise to encourage the shared objective of the community use of school premises and the premises jointly provided on school sites for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities and the Sports Council have invested more than £100 million in capital expenditure and the corresponding amount of revenue needed to run such capital projects. There have been more than 700 projects over the past 20 years. Local authorities fear that the Bill threatens not only their previous investment, but future projects and development. That theme was dealt with in earlier debates. Local authorities rightly believe that the schedule as drafted will give them insufficient control over the management of their investment for the benefit of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing joint-use arrangements continue to operate on the basis of the good will of all the parties concerned, but there is nervousness about the fact that a legal challenge could bring that to an end. There is no real protection for the non-education partner in the event of a disagreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would clarify the Bill's intention. I refer to amendments Nos. 836, 837 and 839. Because the 1986 Act simply gave governors control of school premises outside school hours, the Department for Education has taken the view that it is necessary to deal only with that matter in the Bill, arguing that nothing has changed in respect of use during school hours. It is not clear that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1986 Act gives governors responsibility for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the school".</p></blockquote>
It also gives them specific responsibility to determine the times at which school sessions begin and end. The Education Reform Act 1988 gives governors direct responsibility for managing the school budget, which includes expenditure on premises. Taken together, those provisions imply some doubt as to whether the local education authority can direct community use of particular parts of the school premises at particular times during the school day, or whether the hours available for community use after the school day can be protected from changes in the timing of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where decisions are a matter for the governors, the same problem of delegation to another party arises as in the case of control of premises outside school hours. A partner investing in facilities on a school site where some daytime use is envisaged will want a single agreement and a single management arrangement to cover all shared use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are permissive: they would not require use during the school day, but would allow the governors to decide whether time can be made available. Many agreements made prior to 1986 involve investment on the school site for daytime use by the community. Such use is covered in the management and operational arrangements, which can be complex and expensive. For example, Cheshire county council and Crewe and Nantwich borough council have a joint use agreement covering a jointly-owned sports and recreation complex at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1291</span>
the Victoria community high school known as the Victoria centre. School and community use intermingle on sites owned by both authorities. Non-school staff are based at the site and there is public access throughout the day. A single management agreement is essential. It would give no confidence to the partners if there were a clear legal framework only for the part of the agreement concerning use out of school hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is at least doubtful whether the Department for Education is correct to consider that there is no need to cover use during school hours. Even if that could be more confidently demonstrated, it would do no more harm, and create greater assurance for existing and potential partners, to cover the point explicitly in schedule 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to consider amendments Nos. 838 and 842. Where facilities are popular, it will be necessary for those controlling the management and use of premises to determine priorities among various groups and categories of users. For example, it may be necessary to choose between sports, between letting to a badminton club and to individuals, or to set aside time for particular users, such as pensioners, children, males or females. In that context, the definition of the community relevant to a transfer of control agreement becomes important. It should as far as possible be neutral, rather than capable of an interpretation that might favour one category of user.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a partnership between a district council and a local education authority school, the district may intend the facility to serve at least the whole of its area for recreational purposes. The school is likely to be one of several within a district, or even within one town. Its catchment area as a school will be much smaller. It may overlap with the catchment area of other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government policy on open enrollment for schools means that they compete with each other to recruit pupils. Schools will want to make themselves as attractive as possible to encourage recruitment. The phrase "community served by the school" could be interpreted as restricting the provision to the school's catchment area, but could equally be argued to apply to families of children attending or likely to attend the school. It could therefore provide a school with the basis for arguing that priority for community use should be given to school-based clubs, parent groups and the like above any provision for the wider community. That would frustrate the district council's intention to invest significantly in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it may be argued that "community served by the school" has a less restrictive meaning, than that, but cannot be clear beyond doubt. It would therefore be a better protection for partners in joint use and more neutral in its implications for management committees to adopt the simpler wording—"the local community" as used in the amendments. That would more accurately reflect the intention of existing agreements, offer more incentive for new agreements and make it clearer that decision about local priorities may be taken on their own merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendments Nos. 840 and 841. Joint-use agreements are freely entered into by all parties who are able to specify in advance any necessary conditions for agreement to be reached, including the arrangements for school use during community hours and community use during school hours. If recreation investment is to be attracted to school sites, the agreements need to be even handed. Where the law offers advantages to one party that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1292</span>
are not available to the other, such even handedness cannot be achieved. That will discourage future investment and future agreements. A legal requirement that governors may, by giving notice, override the arrangements in the agreement in order to secure school use under their own control at specified times beyond whatever arrangements may have been covered in the transfer of control agreement, confers a benefit on the school which is not matched by any similar benefit for the partner in the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the general good will that exists in relation to present agreements may mean that governors will rarely use that power, it must be doubtful whether district councils or others would feel able to make significant investment in school sites in future if arrangements for management and control of use could be overridden in that way at any time. That would mean that the ultimate control of use effectively remains vested in the governors alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to reach adequate agreements that safeguard the interests of both a school and its partners without the need for that overriding power. Such arrangements should recognise the financial implications of any changing balance of use, the management implications in respect of safety and maintenance factors, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of primary legislation should be to permit proper arrangements and not to distort them in an apparent attempt to favour one particular party, thus making agreement in future yet more difficult to achieve. I stress that the amendments do not change the purpose or the shape of the legislation. They are intended to improve the legislation so that joint-use agreements can be workable and attractive to both parties as a future proposition. They would remove an unnecessary emphasis on preserving the educational interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of precedent and with the advice and help of their local education authorities, governors are perfectly capable of reaching agreements which do not prejudice the interests of a school. It must be recognised that partners in those agreements, who will be making significant capital and revenue investment for their own purposes, also need adequate safeguards. The amendments merely attempt to provide a more level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 836, 837 and 839. As the hon. Gentleman said, they seek to make it clear that all LEA-maintained school governing bodies would have power to enter into transfer of control agreements which include some use of a school's premises during school hours when not needed for the purpose of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is on to something, because control of the use of a county school's premises is not specifically vested in anyone by existing legislation. Section 42 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 vested in county school governing bodies only the control of use outside school hours. Therefore, there should be no barrier to governing bodies entering into agreements that provide for some dual use during school hours. No doubt the LEA would be a party to such an agreement as the owners of the premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one example in my constituency of a school, which has what might be called surplus classrooms, allowing other community activities to take place in its premises, in conjunction with the LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and he will see why in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of voluntary schools is different. Section 22 of the Education Act 1944 provides for use of a voluntary school's premises to be under the control of the governing body during school hours as well as outside school hours. If, therefore, we want to ensure that the governing bodies of all maintained schools should be able to enter into dual use agreements that cover some use during school hours, some amendment to paragraph 4 of schedule 11 in relation to voluntary schools may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I accept the thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for City of Durham. I want to consider them further to see what the best way of removing barriers to dual use schemes would be. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing the lead amendment, on the understanding that I shall return to it later to give effect to his suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendments Nos. 838 and 842, this is something of a red letter day because I shall ask the Committee to accept them as they are drafted. I think that this is the first time that I have been able to do that and it warms my heart to do so. I am assured that their drafting is impeccable, that their sentiments are admirable and that their aims are laudable. Therefore, I am utterly persuaded by the hon. Gentleman and recommend their acceptance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. For the record, will the Minister tell me the numbers of the two amendments that he has accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are amendments Nos. 838 and 842.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 841, I regret that I cannot keep up my remarkable track record. It deals with the mechanisms by which governing bodies regain control of the use of school premises that are included in a transfer control agreement. We have included what I admit are complex provisions because we believe that it is necessary to breathe life into existing agreements, which otherwise might not be amended and would remain void. Therefore, we have provided for the Bill to apply to agreements already made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the governing body should be able to regain use of the premises in a case where they are being used for the purposes of the school—where, for example, a sports hall is being used for a school event. The absence of such provision seems likely to deter some governing bodies from entering into transfer of control agreements. We want to encourage them to do so. We have, therefore, provided in the Bill for transfer of control agreements to contain standard provisions to that effect. The governing body may regain control for specific purposes and at specified times on giving reasonable notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment removes a provision which would enable a school governing body to negotiate terms under which the school may have use of the premises that are subject to a transfer of control agreement which, in its view, would be more favourable to the interests of the school than the statutory minimum terms, and for the statutory minimum terms—in new section 42(2)—to be waived. I can see no reason for governing bodies not having the option of negotiating improved terms if they are able to do so, nor for this option to be removed solely from county schools, which would be the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1294</span>
For those reasons, I ask the Committee not to accept amendment No. 841. I hope that it will follow my advice on the other amendments and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the lead amendment so that I can consider ways of giving effect to his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister most profusely. I am delighted to get two out of three. That is not a bad record.

I do not know what to say about amendments Nos. 838 and 842. I have served on a number of Committees in the past six years and have never known the Government to accept amendments. I am delighted that the Government have accepted these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little disappointed that amendments No. 840 and 841 cannot be accepted. If the underlying principle were to be accepted, I am sure that we could reach an agreement that would not favour one side or the other. However, I shall not press my luck, nor press amendments Nos. 840 and 841 to a Division. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 836.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is equally difficult to explain with any detail or certainty what the word "reasonable" means. All hon. Members know that the whole idea of using that word is that one knows it when one sees it.

However, the period in this case is expected to be a matter of weeks—perhaps a few weeks—rather than months. To be more specific than that would undermine the purpose of using the word "reasonable" instead of stipulating a time limit. From time to time, such matters may require longer than one would

	<section>
	<div class='title'>NATIONAL CURRICULUM</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 governing the national curriculum and examinations. Some of my hon. Friends who debated that legislation in Committee and others who have had experience of teaching since that time will probably want to refer to the impact of the national curriculum and some of the difficulties that have been caused by the Government's approach to the implementation of such procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have found it impossible to resist the temptation of interfering in the national curriculum, which has had a direct influence on the method of examinations that has been introduced. I wish to concentrate on the problems relating to the testing at key stage 3, especially in English and technology. It has caused great turmoil in secondary schools and it is still causing anxiety to the teachers, pupils and their parents—not to mention school governors, some of whom are advising teachers to boycott the tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to cite an example of the chopping and changing that has occurred in the past few weeks. It was arranged that I should visit a school in Enfield whose head had contacted me following remarks made by the chairman of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1296</span>
education in Enfield, a Conservative councillor. The chairman had expressed anxiety about the consequences of the financial cuts that had been made in that area and the ability of schools to provide full-time education. If schools cannot provide full-time education, they will not deliver the whole national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head and the teachers at that school and others in the area wanted to talk to me about the problems of key stage 3 English, too. Our meeting was arranged for a Wednesday and Thursday but, in just two days, they wanted to discuss not only key stage 3 in English, but also in technology. On the Friday, out of the blue came new instructions for schools about what should happen to key stage 3 in technology for that year. When I visited the school on the Wednesday, the teachers of technology were despairing because they had to rewrite their timetables and adjust their teaching for the rest of the year to prepare pupils for the new form of testing that was announced only in January. It meant that youngsters who had been enthused by their teachers to start projects in technology were being told, after four or five weeks, "Leave those projects. You can't complete them—you must leave them in mid-air because we have to change our method of teaching and the curriculum because the Government have instructed us that technology be tested in a different way."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such chopping and changing is demoralising for teachers and is demotivating for pupils. It is ridiculous that pupils can be encouraged and enthused to undertake project work, and then, because of such chopping and changing, be unable to complete their work. Although the problems in English have received most attention, there are problems in other areas as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was questioned about the problem of English and the assessment established for key stage 3, as some of my hon. Friends and some Conservative Members will know. Indeed, concern was expressed on both sides of the House about the arrangements for testing key stage 3 this year, which is not surprising given the degree of feeling among those responsible for teaching English. The professionals have years of experience and have used the national curriculum imaginatively to try to improve the motivation of pupils. They are now despairing that the testing key stage 3 will test not the national curriculum, but an anthology: a prescribed amount of reading that is not an integral part of the national curriculum for the relevant age group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady aware that, on 14 January of this year, the Secretary of State wrote to his parliamentary colleagues about key stage 3 testing of English? In part of the letter, he told his hon. Friends that the testing procedure reflected the views of teachers. Is the hon. Lady as puzzled by that as I am?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one sense I am puzzled, because the letter certainly does not reflect the views of teachers, as expressed to me and to most hon. Members. In another sense, the Secretary of State occasionally seems to talk to one or two teachers who are possibly hand picked, and concludes that they represent the whole—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) reminds me that the Secretary of State said today that he had visited 75 schools this past year. In fact, he had to correct himself, because it was actually all the Department's Ministers who, together, had visited such a magnificent number of schools.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1297</span>
The tests do not engender confidence in people who have experience of teaching English; which is, perhaps, not surprising because there have been so many changes to the proposed assessment procedure at key stage 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon, the Secretary of State said that the tests had been piloted in more than 400 schools: that too is incorrect. Three agencies have been responsible for compiling the testing arrangements. The first two were sacked by Ministers, because their assessment suggestions involved too much continuous assessment—it was an integral part of the curriculum, and was, perhaps, something with which teachers could have coped, and certainly something in which teachers might have more confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency currently responsible for the tests, the University of Cambridge local examination syndicate, was given the contract only in July last year. Therefore, it has been working to a tight time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Its suggestions on testing have caused great concern among English teachers. That may not be surprising because the expertise of those involved in that organisation was in examining English as a foreign language, which is not necessarily appropriate experience for that project. The tests that have been suggested by that body have been piloted in 32—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may correct me, but I understand that four of the 32 schools dropped out of the pilot, so the number is 28 and not 32. Does she not find it strange that the people conducting the trial did not see fit to seek the views of the teachers who were responsible for the administration of the tests in their schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipated part of the point that I was making about the numbers. Another matter to bear in mind is that all the teachers in the schools that were involved in the pilot were sworn to secrecy, to the extent that a member of one of the committees responsible and a professional in that sphere was not allowed to talk to the teachers, even after he had discovered that some of the schools were involved in the pilot. Moreover, the tests were undertaken by 15-year-olds, not the 14-year-olds who will be taking the key stage 3 assessment later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems with key stage 3 are only one example of the difficulties that have been caused by chopping and changing the national curriculum and the assessment procedure. In January this year, schools were at last told about the books that they would have to buy. Of course, no money for their purchase was forthcoming and I have received a complaint from a head of English in my constituency that several of the books on the current list are out of print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the texts which have been recommended, especially the Shakespeare texts, are unavailable, not because they are out of print but because they are being reprinted to absorb the demand for them as a result of their being on the prescribed list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chaos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows the degree of chaos that exists, as my hon. Friend said. Teachers and schools cannot plan properly. We have heard a great deal during our proceedings about the need for teachers and head teachers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1298</span>
to manage their schools properly, but those trying to do so are having their efforts undermined by constant chopping and changing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to compare the arrangements for the national curriculum and its assessment in England to those in Scotland. In Scotland, the arrangements for assessment are very different and, after discussions about what should happen with seven-year-olds, Scottish teachers are allowed to use their professional judgment about the tests which they give to children and the timing of those tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange to note that among those to whom Ministers do not talk are Scottish Office Ministers with exactly the same degree of responsibility for education as the Secretary of State has in England. It would be worthwhile for them to talk to other Ministers as well as to parents, teachers and governors instead of insulting everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concerns about the national curriculum and assessment are very deep. We believe that the national curriculum is over-prescriptive in nature and that more is proposed because of the Minister's intention to change primary education, to introduce greater specialisation, to stop the cross-curricular project and to introduce streaming with a view to selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are moving in the wrong direction on the national curriculum and assessment procedures. Parents, teachers and governors are worried. The matter is coming to a head because of anxieties about key stage 3. The problems with key stage 3, important though they are, reflect the overall malaise that stems from the constant interference in the national curriculum by Ministers—especially the Secretary of State. That undermines the professional judgment of teachers and ignores their experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to mention some of these important concerns. Unless Ministers begin to listen to people with direct experience of delivering the national curriculum and take on board their concerns, the education of our children will deteriorate. In 1993, that is just not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some general comments on the national curriculum and to take up some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury made about the national curriculum for English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While on holiday this Christmas I was horrified to read a headline in the international version of 	<i>The Guardian</i> on 30 December: "Curriculum success queried". Ministers must have been disappointed that one of the last reports that they received from HMI were about the ineffectiveness of the introduction of the national curriculum in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have regularly promised that the introduction of the national curriculum will raise standards in schools. They have pointed to examination pass rates and the publication of national test results, such as last summer's scores for 7-year-olds, as an indication of its effectiveness. It is interesting that the HMI said that improvements have been patchy and there are few signs of standards improving as a result of the introduction of more regular record keeping by teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI report was one of the last to be issued by the old inspectorate. I would be interested to know—although it does not directly relate to this clause—whether the new Ofsted reports will be genuinely free of political interference. It was obvious that the old HMI reports were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1299</span>
independent because they were often extremely critical of the Government and the effects of Government policy. Many education officers and academics have asked the Government for an assurance about the independence of the new Ofsted reports. It would be useful if the Minister were to give us that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Timothy Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Ofsted reports will be independent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I am sure that my friends in the academic world will be very interested in the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the national curriculum has not so far led to any discernible rise in standards, except in primary science and some aspects of primary English. The principal difficulty that teachers face in all key stages and subjects is matching tasks to the ability of individual pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make some general comments about the national curriculum for English. This afternoon, I received a reply to my oral question to the Secretary of State about changes to the national curriculum for English and the reason for the decision to change it. I shall have to wait for the publication of 	<i>Hansard</i> for the definitive reply, but, from memory, I believe that the Secretary of State said that the decision was made on the advice of the National Curriculum Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State commissioned the National Curriculum Council to review the national curriculum for English. He asked it to do that before the completion of the review cycle plans. The planned study, which was commissioned at the university of Warwick, has been cut short. The revision is a hasty measure, which is being carried out by a small group of officers from the National Curriculum Council. The group includes a representative of the Curriculum Council for Wales. The revision is undertaken on the advice of the NCC, but against the wishes of the profession. The CCW has expressed reservations about the exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCC is pressing for an ideologically driven curriculum to replace the carefully considered national curriculum, which is widely supported by teachers. The changes provoke many questions about the way in which decisions are made by the NCC and the political appointees to that body. Questions have been raised about the number of members of the Centre for Policy Studies who become members of the NCC. Are the NCC's decisions politically independent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have several complaints about English testing at the end of key stage 3. Those complaints provide an example of teachers' worries. Teachers are worried about the poor timing of the release of information. For example, the Shakespeare content was confirmed in October, reading lists in November and the anthology in January. Carefully planned schemes of work have had to be rearranged completely. It is difficult for teachers to plan the purchase of text books, especially when the set texts are chosen after departmental budgets have been committed. Some schools do not have the leeway, especially in the current financial climate, to add to departmental capitation allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1300</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury said, there have been problems with the pilot scheme. Many schools withdrew from it. The remaining schools have little confidence in what they have gained from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cox report stresses the importance of reading whole texts, not simply extracts. It concluded that careful training in drafting and revising were not evident in the test procedures. I have been asked by teachers in my constituency whether the Secretary of State endorses the principles of language teaching and learning that the Cox report sets out. If so, how can he justify his rush towards testing skills other than those endorsed by a Government Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Morale is low among English teachers and that derives from the many changes that they have had to absorb. Many teachers have worked their socks off. Yet the DFE will not countenance a proper trial or unpublished run through to allow teachers to test their preparations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the low morale among English teachers, compounded by their determination to do their very best for their pupils, that has led to their fears that the preparation time will be inadequate to allow students and teachers to show what they are capable of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much hope that the Minister will be persuaded by the arguments. If he listens carefully to the professionals, he will be prepared to make some changes in the way in which key stage 3 tests are planned. He owes it to the profession to listen and to take with extreme seriousness the complaints that it is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) for disappearing from the Committee Room briefly during her speech. My pager flashed up a message inviting me to rush to the aid of somebody suffering a miscarriage. I think that someone must have dialled the wrong number, but I wanted to sort the matter out so that somebody dealt with the person with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four brief comments to make about the national curriculum and the proposals for assessment in the clause. First, it has been said on numerous occasions—no member of the Committee would disagree with the broad principle—that there should be a national curriculum. It is a good idea. However, staff at the NCC, perhaps egged on by Ministers, have gone over the top and the national curriculum now suffers from massive overload. That view is now shared by the current head of the NCC, and it would be interesting to hear the Minister's response to the widespread concern about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national curriculum is massively overloaded and there is an urgent need to reduce its content. Incidentally, that would allow more flexibility for schools and enable them to pick up on their special areas of interest and on the expertise that staff may have. They could then be developed for the benefit of pupils. There is no doubt that the pendulum has swung too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in asking for an urgent review of the content of the national curriculum, I am conscious that that would lead to yet more changes. One of the problems that many people in schools face is the frequency with which new information is given to and requirements are placed upon teachers. The phrase "innovation fatigue" is familiar to members of the Committee and, sadly, to the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1301</span>
Thirdly, I express my concern, shared by others, about the lack of consultation between Ministers and those involved in the teaching profession and education. It is intolerable of the Secretary of State to tell leaders of the teachers unions that the only reason that they wish to see him is to improve their kudos and to increase their membership. It is equally disgraceful that the Secretary of State should describe the members and the views of a consortium of all the parent-teacher associations in the land, which came to see him, as neanderthal. No Opposition Member would applaud that kind of language. The teachers unions, all the parent-teacher associations and the National Association of Governors and Managers are concerned about a particular issue, but the Secretary of State is not prepared to listen. His attitude to consultation is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, all of us know the difficulties that schools are facing in implementing the national curriculum because of the resources that are available. Has not the time come for the Secretary of State to discuss with his colleagues in the Department of the Environment a rethink of the standing spending assessment arrangements for LEAs? Should not there be an independent assessment of the resources needed for the implementation of the national curriculum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that some of the teachers unions have started work on that question. However, the Secretary of State's remarks in the Chamber today about the teachers unions show that he will not be willing to listen to any report commissioned by them. Will the Minister say whether his Department intends to carry out a review such as I have requested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, although his speech has moved a little way beyond the point about which I wished to question him. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the SSA and the funding of education through the local authorities. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that a year or so ago the all-party Select Committee called for greater transparency in the funding of education? What is his response to that call?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was aware of the Select Committee's discusions, but I do not know the details of its recommendations. I should be delighted to look at that information, if the hon. Gentleman is willing to make it available to me. I agree that there is an urgent need to make the calculation of SSAs more transparent. The costs of implementing the national curriculum should be reflected in the level of grant paid to LEAs. For a number of years, schools have been required to do more and more by the national curriculum, without additional resources. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few points about the national curriculum, and specifically about key stage 3—English. The Government's attitude to education is characterised by and unwillingness to consult or to listen, even though they claim to be consulting and listening. We learnt that when we first discussed the Bill, as none of the responses from organisations about the White Paper and the Bill were accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of the Government's actions on the national curriculum. Last year, I wrote to Lady Blatch
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1302</span>
asking for a reassurance that the responses of teachers who had been involved in the pilot tests of key stage 3 English would be considered before the final format was announced. She answered that the views of teachers involved in those tests would influence the final format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took Lady Blatch at her word. I thought that she would consider the responses of teachers involved in the pilot tests and that the final format of the tests would reflect those responses. The Committee can imagine how surprised I was to read two weeks ago in 	<i>The Guardian,</i> when the leaking of the June tests was announced, that the format had not changed one iota. Neither the paper nor the questions had changed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to believe that every teacher involved in the pilot test said that it was great and needed no changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes: did teachers say that the test was so great and so perfect, to use the word supplied by my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury, that not even the questions needed to be changed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has spoken to teachers and schools involved in the pilot tests knows that they have told the Government and the School Examinations and Assessment Council that the pilot test's format did not enable them to bring out the best in their pupils and achieve the highest educational standards. The Committee should reflect on the promise made to me, a Member of Parliament, that teachers' responses would influence the final decision and also on the leak to 	<i>The Guardian</i> which shows that that has not taken place. Whether, in whatever words one chooses to say it, the Minister is misleading Members of Parliament or whether the Government changed their mind after the letter was written, it is clear that, in the pilot test of key stage 3 English, the Government have ignored the views of the teachers who were involved in the pilot test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What a waste of money. We could have saved the time, money and effort of those involved in the pilot test if we had known that the Government, blinded by ideological dogma, always intended to use the test that they had selected for the pilot in the final format in June. It is a disgrace to assume that teachers will be conned on more than one occasion by a promise to pilot and then to consult. The Government will lose the good will of teachers in running pilot tests. That is not good for future test runs or for determining the future curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saddened to learn from one of the schools with which I have close contact that Lord Griffiths, chair of SEAC, has written to chairmen of governors enclosing a school assessment folder containing outline sample test questions for English key stage 3 tests. Those sample test questions have not been made available to the schools that must prepare the pupils for the tests. When the head of that school telephoned the office and asked whether his staff could see the sample test questions so that they could get on with their job of preparing pupils, he was told that the sample test questions would not be available to teachers for one or two weeks. What sort of Government Department can make sample test questions for the English key stage 3 available to lay chairs of governors and then tell the professional staff who have the job of implementing the curriculum and preparing children for testing that they cannot see those questions for two to three weeks?

What values underpin that decision? What view of the teaching profession underpins that attitude? What expectation and what care for the children who are supposed to be prepared for the exams underlie that attitude on the part of Ministers and SEAC, of which the Government are obviously in close control?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That attitude is clear not only in the case of English but in the technology curriculum, where textiles have been dropped from the orders, although many children have been preparing by using textiles as a valuable medium. What has been lost from the national curriculum is any meaningful dialogue between the DFE and teachers. Teachers are already sceptical and believe that their views count for nothing at the DFE. The Government's attitude on the testing of English at key stage 3 confirms such scepticism and will lead to warranted mistrust between the two. If we are all keen to raise standards in our schools and to do the best for the children, that mistrust between the DFE and the teaching profession will do nothing to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the tests in key stage 3 English that are to be used, there is no doubt that the form of testing influences the type of teaching and classroom practice. There is also no doubt that the tests on which the Government have decided are far too prescriptive. They will make it difficult for teachers who have been successfully teaching English for many years to go on teaching English in that proven
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1304</span>
way and still prepare pupils adequately for the tests. They rely on the traditional method of testing, which demands rote learning and knowledge of the right answer and gives no marks unless the answer required by the exam board is written down on the paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a variety of methods of assessment and of teaching that should be used in our schools—for example, drama, discussion, reading Shakespeare texts, seeing how those texts have been interpreted on film by actors and actresses, co-operative learning and folder work. In past years all those have led to improved standards of English in our schools. It is a tragedy that, by being so prescriptive about the format of testing at key stage 3 English, the Department of Education will almost outlaw that type of teaching. Teachers will not be preparing students sufficiently for the exams at key stage 3 in English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that saddens me greatly is that the Government make a lot of fuss about Shakespeare—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
