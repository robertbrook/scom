</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Doesn't time fly when you are enjoying yourself, Mr. Martin? First, I should respond to the point that was originally made by the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright), reiterated by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey). They highlighted the fact that section 1 of the Education Act 1944 refers exclusively to the responsibility of local education authorities for the delivery of education services. They also referred to the moral framework. The more I listen to what hon. Members have to say, the more persuaded I am of their argument.<br><br>
We may have to examine the Bill and other education statutes to ensure that they adequately reflect the new spread of responsibilities for education services beyond the LEAs. The more I consider this matter, the more I suspect that we shall have to ensure that the Bill and possibly other statutes reflect that significant development in the way in which education is delivered.<br><br>
I shall examine the matter bearing in mind the helpful comments of members of the Committee. I may come back either to the Committee or on Report, with an amendment perhaps under the guise of another clause; it will depend on where we think this problem can best be tackled. We will try to correct this increasing anomaly. I am grateful to Opposition Members and to my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, and I give them that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for accepting the argument put by Opposition Members and the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth that additional work on the Bill is required. What principles will the Minister consider when deciding what amendments or new clauses are necessary?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful because it is a difficult area. In the 1944 Act reference was made exclusively to the role and responsibilities of LEAs. To be consistent, we should acknowledge the increasing role of schools and governors, the funding agency for schools and possibly—I am not sure about this—other agencies. That is the area that we must deal with. The references should be widened to acknowledge the changes that have taken place since 1944, particularly in 1986 and 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving us information about how we might proceed. When he referred to other agencies, did he have any specific agencies in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had in mind Ofsted. The question is whether it would be appropriate to make an explicit reference to the role of Ofsted. I am not sure about that, as Ofsted has a separate statutory existence as a Department of State. It may not, therefore, be necessary to refer to Ofsted. It is no more sinister than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's comments. Some of us are anxious about confusion between this Bill, especially clause 10, and the 1944 Act. If the Minister intends to table amendments to clause 10, will he do so quickly to help us to prepare our consideration of the proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention allows me to give the Committee an exciting trailer: clause 10 and other important parts of the Bill will be dealt with by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for Further and Higher Education. The Committee will be delighted to be relieved of listening to my monotonous tones and instead to hear the mellifluous, persuasive voice of my hon. Friend. I do not anticipate Government amendments to clause 10 as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I suspect that amendments will have to encompass much wider matters, because clause 10 and related clauses are more specific.<br><br>
I am anxious to tackle the issue and I ask the Committee to give me time to reflect before presenting my ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for asking the Minister a further question, but he has introduced an important subject. I would like his reasurance on two matters: first, it is not unlikely that the Bill will be guillotined at some point. Will the Minister guarantee that sufficient time will be allocated to debate the amendments? Secondly, even if the process of creating grant—maintained schools were to speed up, it would be many years before they represented a majority of schools. We have already discussed parallel powers and how much consultation there will be between the agencies and authorities involved. As the local authorities are likely to be responsible for the majority of schools for a long time, they will have a lead role within the new framework that the Minister envisages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has neatly encapsulated the difficulties that we face. However much members of the Committee, especially Labour Members, admire the 1944 Act, it could not continue for ever, as circumstances change. If too much is included in the Bill—the relationship between different bodies identified, for example—changing circumstances will quickly render it inoperative or irrelevant. I do not anticipate identifying lead roles: encompassing different responsibilities would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
be preferable. As the hon. Gentleman said, we cannot anticipate the rate at which parents may ballot for schools to become grant-maintained.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend has been a Member of Parliament long enough to know that the rate of progress of a Bill, with or without a timetable, is dictated largely by the Opposition. Of course I want every element of the Bill to be scrutinised properly and I intend that this matter receives appropriate attention. I invite the hon. Gentleman to share that objective and to work with me to ensure that that is achieved. I am sure that he will be happy to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for raising this matter. He is right to say that it is of the utmost importance and to remind us that the excellent 1944 Act is not hewn on a tablet of stone. Clearly, there is some conflict between that Act and the Bill. I welcome his assurance that he will table amendments to deal with that. I have every confidence that those amendments will receive the fullest consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his kind remarks.<br><br>
A number of important points were raised at our previous sitting. I can cover them all by referring to part II of schedule 2. The hon. Member for Bridgend spoke about the difference between schools and the provision of places, but that is covered by paragraph 3(1) of schedule 2, which, under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Responsibility for providing sufficient school places" states:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"If the schools providing relevant education which are available for the area are not sufficient, the funding authority shall, for the purpose of securing the availability of sufficient schools providing such education for the area"</p></blockquote>
and so on. That makes it clear that the provision of school places is fulfilled by the provision of schools within the terms of the Bill. I think that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have noticed that our amendment to schedule 2 would add the words "and appropriate" after the word "sufficient" to cover that point. However, I hope that the Minister will answer a question that has been intriguing me. Given the close relationship between clause 7 and schedule 2, and that we debated schedule 1 after discussing clauses 1 and 2, why was consideration of schedule 2 not timetabled to come immediately after clause 7?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is always a difficult matter for Parliamentary Counsel, who must recommend and decide the structure of the Bill. I wish to place on record my appreciation of the work that has been done by Parliamentary Counsel and the elegance with which they set out the Bill. Hon. Members will agree that it is one of the more readable Bills to have appeared, for which we are all grateful.<br><br>
We had to make a judgment about the order of consideration, which the Committee agreed at the beginning of our proceedings. I apologise if the hon. Member for Bridgend finds it difficult. I can only say that problems would have arisen however we had set the order of consideration. I hope that my references to schedule 2 will be helpful.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
Schedule 2, paragraph 3(2)(b) at line 33 of page 149 contains an important reference to which we shall return later. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"that special educational provision is made for pupils who have special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
That is an explicit responsibility within the overall rubric
<br><blockquote><p>"Responsibility for providing sufficient school places".</p></blockquote>
We consider special educational needs provision to be so important that we have highlighted it deliberately in that separate provision in schedule 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be aware of the great anxiety among Opposition Members about the provision of special educational needs. Not only should provision be made, but appropriate provision must be made. I emphasised that in a private Member's motion which I tabled on 3 July. The extensive comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend on that subject can be found at column 126 of the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings. The funding agency should include members with expertise in special educational needs.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was about to deal with the need for appropriate provision. The Committee will spend a lot of time discussing special educational needs when we consider part III of the Bill.<br><br>
I shall be frank. The Government have gone to considerable lengths in the Bill to try to meet the understandable demands of the special needs community. We did that shortly after I arrived at the Department for Education, in response to a Bill in another place and to work that the Department was already undertaking. We believed that our provisions were breathtakingly radical in pushing back frontiers. People are free to tell us that we have not gone far enough, but I am disappointed that the thrust and sense of our endeavours are not acknowledged. The hon. Lady's point underpins that.<br><br>
I am confident that schedule 2, paragraph 3(2)(b), which provides,
<br><blockquote><p>"that special educational provision is made for pupils who have special educational needs"</p></blockquote>
meets the requirements of all children with special educational needs, however those needs are defined. We shall return to that point later.<br><br>
That leads me to the debate on the word "appropriate". Schedule 2 paragraph 3(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The schools available for any area shall not be treated as sufficient for the purposes of this paragraph unless they are sufficient for the purposes of section 8 of the Education Act 1944".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Bridgend pointed out that the definition of "sufficient" in the 1944 Act covers all the points that he eloquently outlined. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the schools available for an area shall not be deemed to be sufficient unless they are sufficient in number, character, and equipment to afford for all pupils opportunities for education offering such variety of instruction and training as may be desirable in view of their different ages, abilities, and aptitudes".</p></blockquote>
That covers the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). Schedule 2 covers the points about schools places, special education needs, and appropriate provision, which were the thrust of our debate and the amendments. The Committee should reject the amendments because their purpose is covered by schedule 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for paying close attention to Tuesday evening's debate. We look forward to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
the Government's new thinking in response to points made by the Committee. The record of our proceedings will show that I paid tribute to the provisions for special needs set out in part III of the Bill. I said that they constituted a step forward by the Government, although I also said that we could make a few improvements to the Bill. The debate has advanced that cause.<br><br>
We have tried to be specific because, as the Minister rightly points out, a close reading of the 1944 Act suggests that special educational needs should have been fully catered for from that time. Unfortunately, the Education Act 1981 was necessary, because the 1944 Act was insufficiently specific to prompt LEAs to carry out their duties in full. The Education Reform Act 1988 advanced the cause a bit further, but there are still shortcomings in the way in which the Act operates—in some areas, special needs education is being squeezed by other changes brought about by it.<br><br>
The Government have introduced some major improvements to special needs education in the Bill, but there are still fears that need to be laid to rest and issues that need to be clarified. The debates on Tuesday and this morning have shown how we can make real progress on that issue. I am happy to seek leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I have made a grievous error and I shall not expect the Minister to intervene to answer. I forgot to mention the short debate that we had on issues relating to sex discrimination in the Birmingham case and I wonder whether that will be dealt with when disscussing later amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. I apologise because the hon. Gentleman had raised the point before and I neglected to reply. I shall give an answer, if I may under the aegis of this further point of order. We are studying carefully the results of that case and we will respond fairly soon. It is under active consideration by the Department—that is all I could have said in reply to his question in debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Martin. Through you can I prevail upon the Minister the issue I raised concerning schedule 2? Will the Minister give us some guidance on when we might be expected to debate it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, an order of consideration motion was agreed. I should normally not accept another order of consideration motion, unless it came from the Minister who is promoting the Bill. I think that the usual channels would best be able to discuss that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. Our problem is that references to schedule 2 apply to later parts of the Bill. When studying the order of consideration, we thought that it would be wrong to seek to dispose of schedule 2 at an earlier stage given that it may be affected by the Committee's subsequent debates on later parts of the Bill. That is why debate on schedule 2 comes later in the order of consideration: that does not, of course, preclude references to it—always under your guidance, Mr. Martin. We thought it inappropriate to consider it properly at an early stage of the Committee. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Bridgend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. When the next amendment paper is produced,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
would it be possible for the amendments to be printed in the same order as they appear on the selection list? The group we are about to discuss is all right up to amendment No. 106, but one then has to hunt for the remaining four amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will take that into consideration next time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 3, line 23, leave out from 'authority' to 'make' in line 26.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This large group of amendments explores one issue—the relationship between the funding agency for schools and local authorites. We touched on this on Tuesday but I do not think that members of the Committee who attended throughout Tuesday's debates are convinced that the Secretary of State and his representative the Under-Secretary of State for Schools have grasped the central problems that will arise if clause 7 goes through unamended. Our amendments would explore the relationship in greater detail. We hope to persuade the Minister that this clause needs further examination and change at some stage.<br><br>
As the Bill is drafted, the LEA will have responsibility, up to the point at which 10 per cent. of grant-maintained schools are established in one sector, for ensuring provision of sufficient school places. We believe that difficulties will arise after the 10 per cent. point, although we welcome the Minister's statement that that 10 per cent. trigger would not be an automatic mechanism. However, we foresee greater difficulties with planning for education if the clause remains unamended because of the problems of responsibility that will arise between the 10 and 75 per cent. points.<br><br>
On Tuesday, the Minister echoed what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading—that the powers to be given to the funding authority will run parallel to the LEA's powers. The Minister amended that later, telling us that the powers will be parallel, but shared—a slightly difficult concept to accept but he was sure that that would happen. Our amendments explore the difficulties that would result from that parallel and shared arrangement. They question the wisdom of the Minister's solutions.<br><br>
The Minister knows of our dislike of clause 7. We dislike it in principle because we consider it wrong to give the funding authority the role that the LEAs have held for many years. The clause is undemocratic; it militates against proper accountability in education, and for the use of public money. The amendments aim to emphasise not our principal objections, but our practical objections.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The Bill will create chaos. The Minister's proposals will not allow for the efficient use of resources because there will be a significant degree of duplication. The LEA and the funding authority will both make an assessment of the need for extra school places in an area for which they have responsibility. Both will also sometimes make an assessment of the scale of surplus places in their area. Also the Minsister said, more powers will be given to the Secretary of State. On Tuesday, the Minister failed to persuade us of the impartiality of his absent friend.<br><br>
We have tried many times to convince the Minister that those who have a great deal of experience in delivering education, namely the LEAs, are very worried about the implications of the clause. That concern is expressed by both Conservative and Labour councillors. Ministers' frequent dismissal of councillors as merely representing vested interests is ridiculous. They have a great deal of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
experience and expertise in ensuring that the delivery of education is as good as possible and they understand the problems that will arise as a result of clause 7.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to comment on policies which, we think, will create conflict and chaos. What will happen if there is a need for more school places in a particular area? Despite the recession, there are areas in which the school population is increasing. Who will provide the extra places or a new school in areas with an increasing school-age population? It could be that the local authority and the funding authority both make an assessment and both spend their scarce resources on determining population trends and the future school population. Obviously, work will be duplicated.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the funding authority buying in expertise—using consultants to make assessments. That will be expensive and not the best use of public money at a time of scarce resources. Moreover, the funding authority and the LEA may come to different conclusions about what is needed. For example, the funding authority may decide that projections on school populations are such that a new school should be established. The local authority may decide—because it has different information and uses its extra information on planning decisions in that area—that a new school is unnecessary and that the best solution is to create an extra form at a particular school or to increase admissions to other schools.<br><br>
The local authority and funding authority may not only have duplicated roles and spend scarce resources, they may make different population projections. Even if they agree on those projections they may come up with different solutions—a new school or an expansion of existing schools. If the funding authority gets its way in such a case and encourages the building of a new school, that will have an impact on existing schools in the local authority sector. Decisions by the funding authority alone will affect schools in the maintained sector, even though the funding authority will have no contact with them. The catchment area may be the same and there will be knock-on effects, but there will be no public accountability for the funding authority's decisions.<br><br>
Another problem, which was mentioned on Tuesday, is the overlap of responsibilities with regard to surplus places. The local authorities will embark on rationalisation to reduce surplus places as far as possible. Many have recognised that as part of their remit and done their best in difficult circumstances over many years. We now have a new Secretary of State who speaks of being tough on the matter. It was interesting that on Tuesday the Minister could not give us his assessment of the extent of the surplus place problem and varied his estimates as the debate progressed.<br><br>
It is possible for a school facing closure to seek to move into the grant-maintained sector. That has happened in the past. The Secretary of State has assured us that it will not happen, but we see time and again that that is not so in reality. A school in my constituency has opted out to avoid closure.<br><br>
There are three main issues on which the Minister should clarify the position and take on board the serious concerns not only of the Opposition, but of people outside. The first is the problem of parallel and shared responsibility. Apart from the fact that that seems to be a contradiction in terms, it is clearly a recipe for chaos if two bodies are responsible for planning sufficient school places in one area.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
The second problem is that those are rival bodies with exactly the same degree of responsibility, according to the Minister. He refuses to allow the democratically elected local authority to take the lead in strategic planning. That is the basis of one of our amendments and is the only way to avoid such chaos, inefficiency and an incredible waste of public funds through duplication. I should have thought that that would appeal to the Minister.<br><br>
The third problem is that, whenever we point out the potential conflict between the local authority and the funding authority, the Minister comes up with the same answer—it will all be determined by the Secretary of State. Our debate so far has confirmed our worst fears that the Government are further centralising control of education and that local authority schools will get a raw deal as such centralisation continues.<br><br>
The move to grant-maintained status has often been presented as schools moving out of the local authority network. In effect, schools will opt in to centralised bureaucratic control by the Secretary of State. If the Minister does not recognise that to be an important feature of the Bill—he tried to play that down on Tuesday—he has not listened to any of those who have been lobbying him about its consequences.<br><br>
There is another problem. On Tuesday, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"During that period, we would expect much of the impetus for the increase in school places to meet a projected shortfall of places to come from the grant-maintained schools"—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 337.]</p></blockquote>
That creates another player and another potential for conflict. The funding authority will be able to initiate the creation of a new school in their area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span> <i>indicated assent.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister confirms that. The LEA will initiate its own ideas for a strategy for places in its area. The Secretary of State can also make decisions outwith either body. He can give permission for a grant-maintained school to expand, to change status, to increase its entry—to move from five-form to six-form entry—or to create a sixth form.<br><br>
On Tuesday, we asked whether all such permission would be subject to the proposals representing an effective use of resources. The Minister said that schedule 2 provided that it would be. However, if grant-maintained schools were expanded on their initiative and that was arranged between them and the Secretary of State, it would be regulated by clause 85, to which schedule 2 will not apply. That is another potential for chaos.<br><br>
The potential conflict between the responsibilities of funding authorities and LEAs will be compounded. Even were they to co-operate on a strategy, the Secretary of State could come to entirely different conclusions when dealing with an individual grant-maintained school. He would have his own assessment of what should happen—that is a real danger. The Minister may say that that is unlikely, but it happens already. The Government are considering the expansion of parts of the grant-maintained sector without regard for the effective use of resources. That would not be covered by the powers of the funding authority and would affect schools in its area.<br><br>
A middle school in my constituency—to which I have referred—was to be closed under reorganisation proposals. It fought to become grant-maintained because of that, on the basis that those running the school believed in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
middle school education. The then Minister allowed the school to opt out rather than be closed. The school now wants to change its status to become an 11 to 16-year-old school, which does not surprise people who have followed the argument.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
There is a great deal of scope for the Secretary of State to give a nod and a wink to schools about what he would like to happen. I shall quote from the <i>Mirfield Reporter,</i> which I doubt is read often by members of the Committee. It reported a Conservative councillor as saying that he had received a
<br><blockquote><p>"face to face personal assurance"</p></blockquote>
from the Secretary of State that Castle hall would have its bid to become an 11 to 16-year-old school approved. That happened before the consultation period began. I am glad that the Minister is consulting on the matter now, but I wish that he would consult more widely. That report shows the potential for political interference for political ends. Personal assurances to a local councillor may be given by a Secretary of State whose decision could cut across plans for school places devised both by a LEA and by the funding authority when it is up an running.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: So much for the Minister's reassurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) says, so much for the Minister's reassurances. That is an example of what is happening now. As the Government's drive for more grant-maintained schools gets more desperate, who knows what will happen? There is no effective constraint on Ministers to ensure the proper and wise use of resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the newspaper report was especially worrying because, if true, it shows that the Secretary of State, who, in that situation operates almost in a quasi-judicial capacity, is not doing so? Many Opposition Members feel that that worrying problem will get worse if the Bill goes through unamended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. The report is worrying for a variety of reasons. I assume that the Minister will say that he cannot comment on that specific case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has made a serious allegation. I shall take the matter up with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers), who is familiar with the procedures, has said that the Secretary of State cannot give such undertakings because he is bound to give proper consideration to any application and to receive official advice. As ever, the Secretary of State would also be subject to judicial review if his decision were contrary to the law or the guidelines in any way. The reported undertaking appears extremely unlikely, to say the least, as I know the extent to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pays attention to constitutional niceties. I shall pursue the matter that the hon. Lady has raised and get to the bottom of it, but I can assure her that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would not and could not give such an undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would expect no less from the Minister, but I make no allegation: I am merely reporting what a Conservative proponent of grant-maintained schools is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
saying in his locality. Other Conservative advocates of grant-maintained schools may be saying similar things in other localities to try to push schools into that sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Congdon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Name one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just done so. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have time to make a speech later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's comments are disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that, but what is disgraceful are reports in the paper that give the clear impression that what the Minister is telling us is not correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Congdon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to what was happening in many places. She should name those places if she wants to make such an allegation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should take careful note of the correspondence that some of his hon. Friends send to their constituents. We shall come to that matter later in the Bill, and the hon. Gentleman should take an interest in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He might even make his maiden speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.<br><br>
There is a problem with the school in my constituency, but that is not the basis of my argument, it is an example of what can happen and of the difficulties that will face the public in ensuring the efficient and effective use of resources. The Government are always giving lectures about the need for efficiency and how keen they are for resources to be used wisely. The clause is a recipe for conflict between the funding authority and the local authority. On the basis of the newspaper report, it is probable that a Conservative Secretary of State will interfere. He will not be constrained by an overriding responsibility for the effective use of resources that appears in some education legislation. That is why people are anxious that the clause, and the Bill, are damaging and wrong. They will be bad for education and will not promote the efficient use of resources.<br><br>
Unless the Minister reconsiders the clause, there will be chaos—an absence of proper planning and an enormous waste of public resources which are desperately needed to improve the delivery of education in schools. The clause moves us further in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are obvious problems with the proposal for shared responsibility between local authorities and the funding agency. The Bill's undue complexity could mean that in many LEAs, where an insignificant number of schools have grant-maintained status, the funding agency, which is a non-democratic, unelected body without local responsibilities, would share responsibility with those democratically elected, locally responsible LEAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that when an insignificant number of schools have grant-maintained status, there will be shared responsibility. That is not so; there is the safeguard of the 10 per cent. threshold.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of how one defines an insignificant number. We will discuss that in a later
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
amendment. Ten per cent. is not a significant number; it is rather small. Such a mix will lead to chaos; the resulting confusion will do nothing to enhance credibility and everything to remove it.<br><br>
The amendment's commonsense approach would ensure that the responsibility for providing sufficient appropriate places rests either with the LEA or with the funding agency. The amendment would clarify the issue and therefore strengthen the Bill.<br><br>
I want to discuss special educational needs. When he summed up the debate on the previous set of amendments, the Minister said that the Government had carefully considered children's special educational needs and that the Bill took those into account. I agree that this time the Government have made an effort to meet the needs of children with special educational needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have not gone far enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the Government could have gone further. The confusion surrounding the proposals for special educational needs worries me. The funding agency's involvement in determining special educational needs will lead to confusion. The Minister mentioned the 10 per cent. entry point—the trigger point. However, the 10 per cent. entry point and the 75 per cent. exit point refer to the primary or secondary phases individually. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
The matter is quite complicated. I hope that the Minister will pay attention and answer my questions. I shall repeat them when he listens and stops speaking to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is my friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, your hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will answer my important questions. Many people involved with special educational needs are interested to hear the Minister's response. It is possible for a local education authority to have continued responsibility for primary provision, without the involvement of the funding agency, yet share responsibility for secondary provision with the funding agency. In that situation, the local education authority would have sole responsibility for establishing the number of places for primary pupils with statements, but share that responsibility for secondary schools with the funding agency. It is not clear whether the funding agency only has the power to establish a grant-maintained special school for the age phase affected by the 10 per cent. entry point or whether it can establish an all-age special school, or a grant-maintained school for the age phase for which the local education authority still has sole responsibility. Similar points apply to proposals to enlarge or change the characters of ordinary grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
The principal objection to the intervention of the funding agency is that it would create unnecessary and unwelcome confusion as to which organisation is responsible for, in the DFE's words
<br><blockquote><p>"a clear and coherent authority wide policy."</p></blockquote>
The funding agency would confuse the question of who is responsible for that policy, but the proposals would also confuse the question of which organisation is responsible for reviewing that policy. There is additional confusion as to who is responsible for the special education budget. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
the local education authority and the funding agency disagree over the level of the special education budget, who will finally take responsibility for it? Perhaps the Minister will answer those questions.<br><br>
The introduction of the funding agency will not help the LEA carry out its responsibilities under the Education Act 1981. The agency will introduce a bureaucratic hindrance to the efficient operation of those responsibilities. I hope that the Minister will respond to those points because people involved in special education genuinely want to know the answers to some of those questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this point, I seek clarification and assurance on the meaning of part II of schedule 2, which refers to clause 7 (1)(a). That part is about
<br><blockquote><p>"Functions where responsibility for providing sufficient school places is shared"</p></blockquote>
between the funding authority in Wales and the local education authority. Schedule 2 part II paragraph 3(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The funding authority shall, for the purpose of securing the availability of sufficient schools … exercise their powers to publish proposals for the establishment, alteration and discontinuance of schools."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 2 of the same schedule states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising the powers, the funding authority shall have regard to the need for securing"</p></blockquote>
and so on.<br><br>
The schedule refers only to the funding authority. I am concerned as to whether the LEAs will continue to share responsibility. If they lose their responsibility for providing sufficient places, under section 8 of the 1944 Act they would also lose responsibility for section 76 of that Act, which requires LEAs to take account of parents' wishes.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help the hon. Gentleman? He is right that schedule 2 and the various paragraphs—in particular paragraph 3—refer only to the funding authority, in other words, the schools funding council for Wales. The Minister's earlier reference to paragraph 3(3) is of particular importance to Welsh Members, including the hon. Gentleman, who are concerned for the provision of Welsh-medium education. Schedule 2 paragraph 3(3) makes it clear that the schools funding council for Wales will be able to provide for Welsh-medium schools and places, under section 8 of the Education Act 1944, which established the Welsh-medium schools. Therefore, schedule 2 paragraph 3(3) extends the duty that already lies on LEAs, whereby they can provide Welsh-medium education to the schools funding council, when it operates under clause 7 and schedule 2 of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. Nothing is removed from the LEAs' responsibilities between the 10 per cent. entry point and the 75 per cent. exit point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank-you.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been a re-run of our previous debates. There is nothing wrong with that because it is important to get such matters right. We have seen further into the recesses of the minds of Opposition Members, particularly that of the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor). I noted her saying that she and her hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
Friends are questioning the wisdom of clause 7—in other words, they are seeking to undermine its very operation. She continued to say that it was wrong to give the funding agency for schools a role that LEAs have held for so many years. That is revealing because it suggests a fascinating conservatism from the Opposition, which I find, in some ways, quite warming. The new philosophy—in so far as there is one—of Opposition Members is that they cannot change what has been for so many years. That is elegant traditionalism at its best, but as a philosophy of a progressive political party it is a bit lamentable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am called "conservative", I plead guilty on this occasion, because it means that I believe in democracy. Local education authorities are democratic and accountable to the people who elect them, the funding agency will not be.

I prefer democratically accountable local education authorities to an undemocratic funding agency.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he supported the "ultimate democracy" of accountability to schools, presumably through parent ballots for governors and opting out. Will the parents and governors of grant-maintained schools elect members of the funding agency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mischievous. He knows that that is not the case. The Committee has spent a long time defining the role of the funding agency for schools, which will operate within a statutory framework and will pay grants based on formulae. We provide as much accountability as possible to parents and governors. That improves on the present position. I give way to the hon. Member for Hemsworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way to a humble Back Bencher. I shall ask a simple, perhaps naive question: why does not the whole population of a school catchment area elect school governors? That would be ultimate local democracy. I have advocated that for a long time. I hope that the Minister will join my campaign. I am sure that the hon.

The hon. Member for Dewsbury said that local education authorities are worried about the Bill. They would be, wouldn't they? The long-established—the hon. Lady's criterion for efficacy—institutions of local government are worried because their role is being challenged: parents will be able to exercise an option for their schools to be operated differently. I sympathise with the anxieties of LEAs, but we cannot formulate our education policy simply to reassure a specific group that feels threatened. It is intriguing if the Opposition genuinely believe that we should do that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we have argued previously about whether people feel closer to a school governor than a county councillor. My hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Porter) pointed out earlier that in the shire counties many parents do not identify closely with a county hall that might be 40 or 50 miles away. I do not agree that the present position is the ultimate expression of democracy and accountability, which will be undermined by identifying the democratic unit as the school.</span></p>

Friend the Minister for giving way when he is stimulating so much interest. Does my hon. Friend agree that throughout the history of our education system, schools have flourished under a number of different administrative arrangements? There are many good local education authority schools, both in my constituency and elsewhere. There were many good schools under the old direct grant system, and there are many excellent independent schools. Does my hon. Friend agree that what really matters is the quality of the teaching, the morale and the children's results? Our debate should concentrate on those important matters, not on a particular administrative system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am so grateful to my hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should concentrate on the sharing of responsibility, which is what the amendment is about. The debate has been interesting, but it is more of a Second Reading debate than a consideration of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Dewsbury raised an interesting point that deserves attention. She claimed that it would be an expensive process if the lean and fit funding agency for schools saw the need occasionally to seek outside advice, guidance or support. I invite her to contrast that possibility with the concept of a local education authority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
carrying a large staff and a large fixed overhead year after year against the time when it might have to get involved with, say, a schools reorganisation. Given that local education authority administration costs £900 million per year, the hon. Lady might consider that it is possible that a funding agency for schools that is able to resource itself on a much more ad hoc basis might represent a more effective use of resources. I do not agree with the hon. Lady's analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's idea that local councils have people sitting on their backsides waiting for a local reorganisation shows how little he knows about the reality of what goes on in local education departments. The Minister is totally out of touch and ought to realise that the staff about whom we are talking are involved with the on-going delivery of education day by day, week by week and term by term. Those people know their local areas and schools. They respond to what parents want every week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but those people would not be employed by the funding agency for schools. I shall rest my case and let people outside the Committee judge which is the best analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told us that grant-maintained status would increase parental choice. However, he has not considered the decisions of parents who choose to remain with local education authority control. There are two large secondary comprehensive schools in Cambridgeshire—the Soham and Impington village colleges—which have strong academic reputations and whose parents voted against grant-maintained status. Will the Minister say how that choice will be preserved under the system that he envisages?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather similar to asking about what happens to Conservative voters in a Labour-controlled LEA. In any democratic system, the will of the majority is accepted. Unless the hon. Lady wants to do interesting things to the local accountability that the Opposition espouse, I cannot offer much solace.<br><br>

The hon. Member for Dewsbury went on to say that the funding agency for schools would have no contact with the maintained sector. We recently spent a long time discussing clause 5 and identified myriad ways in which it obliges the funding agency and local education authorities to exchange information. I was at pains to say that I expected the funding agency for schools to work in close harmony with LEAs, and that if LEAs adopted a dog-in-the-manger attitude and refused to co-operate with the FAS, they will be harshly judged by their electorate for failing to co-operate in the process of providing the best education in an area. I know that that is not what Opposition Members of the Committee are arguing, but they should be careful because that is how their words could be construed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly would not want that idea to be taken up from the debate.<br><br>
The Minister said that he did not want the funding agency to employ people from local education authorities. I asked on Tuesday who the funding agency would employ to carry out the functions that we discussed. Would branch 1 civil servants from the Department for Education

be transferred to the funding agency to carry out those duties? If not, and if LEA staff with the necessary expertise are not to be employed, where are the staff to come from?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman—I misled him unintentionally. I was responding to a point raised by the hon. Member for Dewsbury by saying that the funding agency for schools would not employ the sort of people currently employed by LEAs to provide particular services, because under the Bill it is not required to provide those services. There is no let or hinderance of the people that the FAS will be able to employ. If it sees fit to employ people from LEAs, it will be free to do so. Initially and logically, the staff of the FAS is likely to come mainly from those currently in my Department who are working in this area and who have built up expertise. I am sorry if I misled the hon. Gentleman. It was unintentional.<br><br>
It has been suggested that the funding agency for schools will be able to establish new schools, irrespective of the provision by the local authority sector. We have dealt with the matter before, and I shall have to respond to it as many times as it is raised, until the Committee is satisfied with what I say. Any proposal by the FAS for new school places or provision will need the approval of the Secretary of State if there are objections. The LEA or the governing body of any school affected may object to a proposal by the FAS to establish a new grant-maintained school. In dealing with the FAS proposal and the objections, the Secretary of State would have to have regard to need and existing provision in the LEA sector. The idea that the FAS will run riot across the country, building new grant-maintained schools willy-nilly and undermining the provision in the county maintained sector, is entirely false. That will not happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister therefore give us an assurance that the Secretary of State will use his powers under the Bill to ensure that the funding authority does not allow a new grant-maintained school in any area where there are surplus places?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot prejudge what the Secretary of State will do. The hon. Lady is trying to tempt me into having the sort of face-to-face conversation with her in the Committee that she alleged the Secretary of State had with a councillor—according to a newspaper report. Much as I may enjoy face-to-face conversations with the hon. Lady, I will not make commitments that would prejudice my position, or more importantly the Secretary of State's position, in our statutory duty to give proper consideration to the proposals. The Secretary of State will, as ever, discharge that responsibility impartially, fairly and within the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our difficulty is that the Minister has refused to write into clause 7 and previous clauses a commitment that the funding agency will operate efficiently. Our worry is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury suggested, the funding agency will be able to increase surplus places by setting up a new school: that is an inefficient way to operate. The Minister has not adequately dealt with that problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for enabling me to do so again. We are back to our good friend schedule 2, part II, paragraph (4) which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this paragraph requires a funding authority to take any action where to do so would not be an effective use of their resources."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
That is rather quaint Parliamentary Counselese for what the hon. Gentleman is requesting; it simply puts it a different way. Of course, there will be an obligation on the funding agency for schools to use its resources properly. This Government of all Goverments would not set up a body, give it large sums of taxpayers' money and then expect anything other than an effective and efficient use of that money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right; we have had this discussion already. It is recorded in the <i>Official Report.</i> I asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will the Minister look again at the schedule? It says that it would not be an effective use of "their" resources. Opposition Members are concerned about the effective use of overall resources for education."</p></blockquote>
To which the Minister replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"That is the intention of the Bill."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 394.]</p></blockquote>
The point that the hon. Member for Wallsend and I are making is that that intention may be in the Minister's mind but how is it enacted in; the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We dealt with that on Second Reading. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants a different approach to the question. If so, the general election covered that ground. His party campaigned honestly and with great integrity; it said that more money should be put into education and that people should be prepared to pay more taxes to fund that. His party lost the election badly. In that sense—perhaps only in that sense—that debate has been held and the Government are now accountable to the public for the proper and effective discharge of their responsibilities and for the efficient use of the overall resource of the DFE.<br><br>
It is not normal practice to include in a Bill a provision that the Secretary of State will ensure that resources are properly used. I have not come across that in a Bill; perhaps we should include it as a standard clause. Is that what the hon. Gentleman wants? I would not dissent from that. I would accept that responsibility, as would my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. But it would add nothing to the meaning of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I bring the Minister back to the point? He referred to the effecive use of resources by the funding agency for schools. The point is that an effective use of resources by the funding agency may lead to an ineffective use of resources by the LEA. Where is the safeguard?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is pretty staggering stuff. In view of the amount of money that some LEAs spend, and in view of the examination results achieved, it is breathtaking nerve to suggest that our proposals for accountability at school level and an effective funding formula will be worse than the present system under the alledgedly accountable LEAs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, try again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister a specific example. The funding agency for schools may want to create a new, grant-maintained school, which may be an efficient use of its resources, but there may be surplus places in the LEA area. The creation of a new, grant-maintained school would further worsen that position, making the LEA's use of resources inefficient. The Minister has not answered our question.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so for the last time; I will not answer such a question again. I have answered it three times already, I believe. That can be checked in <i>Hansard.</i> If the funding agency for schools decided that further school places in the form of a new school were needed, it would make such a proposal. That would be considered by local schools and the LEA, both of which may object. The proposal would then go to the Secretary of State who must have regard to the provision of basic need, as he does at present. Given this Secretary of State's earlier pronouncement about surplus places, what the hon. Gentleman suggests could not possibly take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand why Opposition Members persist in asking the same question and forcing me to give the same answer, over and over again. I hope that the hon. Lady will not do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will. The Minister must accept that the reason why we keep asking the question is that, as the Minister said at a previous sitting, the Secretary of State has already given grant-maintained status to 50 per cent. of the schools that applied to him when they were threatened with closure by the LEA. If one in two schools seeking grant-maintained status because they are threatened with closure receive grant-maintained status, that threatens the overall provision of places and puts the LEA in an awkward position when it wants to get rid of surplus schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. I do not know offhand the circumstances in which all the applications were made, so I cannot answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that I mentioned a school that had been named for closure whose application for grant-maintained status was rejected by the Secretary of State. If my hon. Friend conceded the principle of the Opposition's case, it would be open to any mischievous LEA to nominate for closure any school that it believed was about to apply for grant-maintained status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Member</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cries of "What a good idea," from Opposition Members give the lie to their argument. My hon. Friend made an important point. That insidious process is going on up and down the country even as we speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I correct the Minister. It was not hon. Members but this hon. Member who said, "What a good idea."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 1 thought that I heard a chorus. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has added ventriloquism to his other talents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the point about the Secretary of State's pronouncements on the need to tackle the problem of surplus places. Am I right to construe from what the Minister said that if the funding agency proposed a new grant-maintained school in an LEA area where there were already surplus places, the Secretary of State would turn down the proposal? If he did not, there would be good grounds for seeking a judicial review because his action had been unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have answered his own question. I shall not mandate in advance what a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
Secretary of State is likely to do in those circumstances. It is a long-established principle that the number of surplus places is one of the major criteria taken into account by the Secretary of State, and that will continue. To protect my right hon. Friend's position, I must point out that each case would be regarded on its merits and that we cannot pre-judge a case. But it must be evident from what my right hon. Friend and I have said that surplus places would be a major criterion of consideration, as it always has been.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
I shall try to answer the important point raised by the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg). After the 10 per cent. point, the funding agency for schools can establish a grant-maintained special school. I would not expect that to happen often, although it is a possibility. Where that was thought appropriate, the funding agency should, in my view, have the authority to establish an all-age special school, whichever 10 per cent. threshold may have been crossed. I do not believe that the character of a special school of the age range that it covered would be inhibited in any way, regardlesss of which threshold had been crossed. I shall consider this matter further, but that is my preliminary response to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
It is fair to say that grant-maintained schools will always be special, and in a category of their own, and that they may therefore be treated somewhat differently from other schools. Above all, we wish to ensure the integrity of their provision rather than be too slavish to the provisions that cover the maintained sector. I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman after reconsidering the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How will the admission policy of a grant-maintained special school be determined?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is going away from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to that also. The answer would almost certainly be, as now, or in the normal way, but I shall come back on that.<br><br>
The amendments, many and ingenious though they are, are designed to undermine the whole purpose of clause 7, as the hon. Member for Dewsbury said, and in particular to prejudice or inhibit phase 2—the period between the 10 and 75 per cent. triggers—that we regard as an essential part of the clause.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of the underlying philosophy behind all this, which should not be forgotten. We have established the principle of the option of grant-maintained status for parents and pupils, and having experienced the existence of the growing grant-maintained sector, we consider it vital that a proper framework be provided not only in law but in institutional, funding and planning terms. To keep faith with that philosophy, we have had to make the provisions in clause 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the philosophy. Does the Minister understand the anxieties of many Opposition Members that the shared responsibility will not make for good delivery of essential public services? I give the example of the speech therapy service. At present, responsibility for this is shared between the health service and LEAs. This has not worked to the benefit of children who need that important therapy. A number of court cases have been heard to determine where responsibility lies. That is not a good way to provide public services. Our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
concern is that the Bill will make the same mistake. Will the hon. Gentleman say what responsibilities the Bill provides to ensure that similar confusion does not arise?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am as comfortable with the idea of shared responsibility as with that of monopoly responsibility. The evidence of the quality of service provided by LEAs is not uniformly reassuring. There are, of course, some excellent LEAs; there are also some diabolical ones. Given the hon. Gentleman's distinguished background in the area, I can understand why he suggested that it is inconceivable that anyone other than a LEA can provide an adequate level of service, but I do not accept that suggestion. His rejection of the viability of shared responsibility is, perhaps, as total as my unease with monopoly provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be aware that, when the responsibility for the delivery of speech therapy rested with one body, the service was effective—children got the support that they needed. Because the Government have shared responsibility between the health service and LEAs, the service has been reduced. That is not in the interests of children who need it. The service was far better when there was a monopoly provider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with neither the hon. Gentleman's analysis nor his conclusions. We may have to agree to differ on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to finish, but will give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but shared responsibility is an important issue.<br><br>
I visited the Nuffield language and speech unit at No. 6 Castlebar hill only yesterday. It carries out incredibly good, pioneering work with children who are shown in non-verbal tests to be extremely bright but who had no ability to communicate verbally when they arrived at the unit. The unit was in danger of closure because the health trust which now runs it and the education authorities who send children from their areas there could not agree which of them should fund it. I am happy to say that most of the costs will be covered under a 50:50 agreement between the Epson education authority and Epsom Health Care NHS trust. That decision was last-minute—it would surely be much better if one body had responsibility and the Government made sure that it carried out its functions effectively and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well no, I do not agree. The Government have been trying for 13 years to ensure that local authorities carry out their functions effectively and efficiently and we have not uniformly succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Government should resign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The conclusion that could be drawn is that perhaps we should be even tougher with some local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman answered his own question when he said that the matter was resolved in the end. With good will on both sides, there is absolutely no reason why such matters cannot be resolved. To suggest that grown people in such organisations cannot work together in the interests of—in this case—children reflects sadly on Opposition Members' view of those in public service. I certainly do not share that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the efficiency and effectiveness of local authorities. He probably agrees with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
me that one of the great motivators to improve efficiency and effectiveness has been the work of the Audit Commission, set up by the Conservative Government. Does he agree that the remit of the Audit Commission should be extended to cover grant-maintained schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting suggestion. I would not entirely rule it out at this stage, and we may return to it.<br><br>
I do not want to flog the argument to death, but I assume that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting a monopoly provision. I am interested in giving grant-maintained schools a choice of audit provision, provided that I am satisfied, and can satisfy the House, that it is acceptable. Later in the Bill there is reference to that in a different context. I am keen that we do everything possible to ensure that moneys in education, in LEAs and grant-maintained schools, are spent properly. I am interested in studying anything that Committee members can produce that would strengthen the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, just before Christmas, the National Audit Office will produce its report on the accountancy procedures that have been adopted in the grant-maintained sector. Will the Minister agree that any recommendations from the National Audit Office will be incorporated in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These are very interesting questions, but they have nothing to do with the amendments. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can ask them another time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have succeeded in persuading members of the Committee that the amendments would undermine the purpose of clause 7 and would thus undermine the purpose of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the last time I shall give way. I keep trying to make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is most kind of the Minister to allow me to intervene. At the moment, LEAs have responsibility for ensuring the efficient delivery of places in their own geographic boundaries. If one LEA had surplus places and an LEA next door required more places, would the funding agency—when deciding on providing places or closing places down—study several LEAs, or would it study one LEA at a time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the great beauties of the funding agency is that it would have the facility to take a more strategic view. For a moment, I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to suggest that we pick up the schools from one area and wheel them next door. At the moment, there is a constraint on the LEA arrangement and map that would not be a constraint on the funding agency for schools. That would be a new strength in the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way, as I regard this as a supplementary to the hon. Gentleman's previous intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question is not whether the schools will be wheeled next door, but whether the pupils will be wheeled next door?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regard has always been made to demographic planning and so on. I gave the Committee a rather tedious list. I have now given it twice—the Committee seem to be anxious to get me to say things at least three times. Under the aegis of clause 5, I gave a list of the items that I would expect to be involved in the exchange of information between LEAs and the funding agency for schools, as part of the planning process. The list included demographic developments, planning developments and those children approaching school age. Those are things that an LEA normally deals with. They would be shared with the funding agency so that it could take an overall view that the hon. Gentleman mentions and plan appropriately—plan not only for the provision of places but also for the location of the provision of places to best suit the needs of parents in a particular area.<br><br>
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee to reject these amendments because they aim to undermine the purpose of clause 7, and therefore the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite what the Minister said, Opposition Members do not feel convinced that he has answered the real concerns that we addressed when we moved the amendments. The Minister began by saying that we had already spent a lot of time in denning the role of the funding agency. Indeed we have. The amendments are not about the role of the funding agency. That must be understood. They deal with the relationship of the funding agency with LEAs during the vital phase 2 of development. I do not accept the Minister's contention that they are wrecking amendments or that they would make it more difficult for funding agencies to operate. The Opposition accept that funding agencies will play a role in securing sufficient school places within a particular area. The amendments do not touch on that.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
We remain concerned that the Bill makes no provision for the relationship between LEAs and the funding agency. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North said that many geographical areas have had a diversity of education provision. He cited his experience in direct grant schools and said that they were able to operate alongside local education authority schools. However, he did not mention one crucial fact. The city in which he taught had four direct grant schools out of about 40 secondary schools, but the LEA had a clear responsibility for strategic planning and for making overall provision for school places in that area. The amendments do not deal with choice or the diversity of providers, nor with the parental right to send their children to schools provided by one organisation or group of people or another. The amendments are, in essence, about organisational matters. They are about who takes organisational responsibility once there is a multiplicity of providers and organisers in a geographical area. That is the crucial point about the amendments.<br><br>
What is known as phase 2—the period between 10 per cent. entry and 75 per cent. exit—could become a permanent state of affairs for many local authorities. The Government might assume that there will be almost a natural progression: at 10 per cent. the LEA will lose overall control, there will then follow a transitional period during which the LEA and the funding agency co-operate and learn from each other, and then, by some natural means of evolution, the 75 per cent. exit point will be reached and the funding agency will take total control.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
That is not likely to be the case in most parts of the country. Many LEAs—or, as they will become, former LEAs—will remain in phase 2 permanently. The Bill is setting up not a transitional arrangement but a legal framework for the provision of school places in geographical areas for many decades into the next century. That is why Opposition Members insist that careful thought is given to the way in which that framework is built and to the operation of the relationship between the two bodies.<br><br>
The amendments offer a choice. Either one body—probably the LEA—is made responsible for the strategic planning of school places, or one body is given the lead responsibility. Either option would be acceptable, although I should prefer the former. If the LEA had the lead control while the two bodies work together, that would be a better choice. It would be unacceptable to leave the Bill as it is and talk about parallel and shared responsibility—those terms describe different states of being for funding agencies and local education authorities. I do not wish to be repetitive about surplus places nor shall I give more examples of the difficulties of organising responsibility, but the inescapable conclusion from everything that has been said by Opposition Members is that we shall move into a period of confusion and chaos. Not only will there be two responsible bodies, the funding agency and the LEA, but it has become clear from the Minister's answers that there will be a third player—the Secretary of State. That will not add anything to the efficient administration and running of schools in one geographical area.<br><br>
It is appropriate to remember, when discussing bureaucracy and the administration of schools, that the decisions of administrators have a direct and relevant influence on what occurs in the classroom. One cannot divorce the quality of teaching, and the learning in the classroom, from the quality of the administrative structure in which schools operate. That is why the issue is so important. Without effective administration, there will not be the high quality teaching and the learning that we seek.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State, when asked about the relationship between the funding agencies and LEAs described those organisations as having parallel duties and not shared responsibilities. He uttered one phrase that gives me much cause for concern. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A little healthy competition will be no bad thing for some LEAs."</p></blockquote>
In one respect, the Bill would legislate for such competition. It will make LEAs and funding agencies compete to secure more places within their sectors. The Minister spoke about co-operation and the Secretary of State on Second Reading said that
<br><blockquote><p>"all but the most Luddite of local education authorities"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 634–5.]</p></blockquote>
would fail to co-operate, as co-operation would be in the best interests of children and the quality of teaching. Luddite—as I think the Minister will agree—could also describe funding agencies and Secretaries of State. Three elements will be responsible for the provision of places and each one could choose to be Luddite. The Secretary of State admitted that when he referred to possibly Luddite LEAs. None of us want any of those partners to act in a Luddite fashion and damage the quality of education and the existing school places within the LEAs.<br><br>
I have emphasised that the Bill encourages competition because co-operation is necessary in that part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
education service. Nothing in the Bill would legislate for co-operation. I shall describe how the Bill would encourage competition. The funding agency and the LEA have a vested interest in fighting for places within their sectors. If an LEA does not secure enough places to go above the 75 per cent. mark, it faces the prospect of withering on the vine. It will cease to exist as a provider of schools in that area. LEAs will be motivated to compete to provide places because they feel that they do a good job and that they have certain features that make them worth defending as a continuing provider of education.<br><br>
The Government have made it clear that they want an extension of places within the grant-maintained sector. The decisions and legislation are geared towards providing that. Members of the Committee are equally guilty of bias. Conservative Members want an expansion of places within the grant-maintained sector. Opposition Members want a retention of places within the LEA sector. Conservative Members do not feel more or less strongly than Opposition Members do on the matter, but we can learn from that that both sectors will compete like heck. There is a bureaucratic reason why they will do so. I raised the issue when the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) spoke and I do not believe that it has been answered. In many geographical areas, the number of children in the grant-maintained sector could fall below 10 per cent. That could happen either by the removal of surplus places in the grant-maintained sector or by the expansion of places in the LEA sector.<br><br>
The same picture could be painted at the 75 per cent. exit point: because of ballots, the removal of surplus places or expansion, the percentage might fall below 75 per cent. Whether the Bill will allow the funding agency to step out of the scene if the percentage falls below 10 per cent., and the LEA to get back into the system if it falls below 75 per cent., is not clear.<br><br>
I feel strongly that both the LEA and the funding agency have a vested interest in competing for places to ensure that they continue to be game players in the provision of school places in a geographical area. Both sides will feel that they have a valuable role to play. The Bill encourages competition, not co-operation. The only co-operation that it promotes is the exchange of information. After the information has been considered, and after we have argued the figures, there needs to be co-operation in the decision making.<br><br>
The Minister explained that if the grant-maintained sector and the LEA cannot agree about the provision of places, the matter will go to the Secretary of State for a final decision. He may even introduce a third scenario and decide between three possibilities. The Minister seems to accept that it will be difficult to get decisions on the provision of places. The Secretary of State will increasingly be called upon to make a final decision. That is not good for the management of education provision or for confidence and stability in schools and classrooms.<br><br>
I want an Act that legislates for co-operation. The LEA should either be totally responsible for the provision of places in phase two or it should be given the main responsibility for strategic planning. The Bill shares that responsibility between the funding agency and the LEA; it allows them to work in parallel. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) said, to work in parallel but never to meet is not an efficient use of the time. The funding agency, the LEA and the Secretary of State should not get enmeshed in disputes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
The amendment would not wreck the Bill, the funding agency or the grant-maintained sector. I wish that it would, but we are not trying to do that in these amendments. Other amendments would remove the funding agency's power, but these amendments would provide clarity and prevent chaos. They provide a simple to understand and simply administered system for securing school places. They would promote co-operation rather than unhealthy competition at this crucial stage.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley eloquently pointed out, the amendments would remove the phase 2 shared responsibility, which is triggered at 10 per cent., and leave the responsibility for providing sufficient places with the LEA until phase 3, which is triggered by 75 per cent. grant-maintained pupils.<br><br>
The Opposition are not convinced by the Minister's arguments that shared responsibility will work. The terms "phases 1, 2 and 3" seem to have come from the DFE; they are not used in the Bill. As my hon. Friends observed, the implication is that there will be an inevitable process towards all schools being grant maintained, which we consider unrealistic. If the Government's proposals are implemented, many LEAs and county councils will find themselves permanently in phase 2.<br><br>
We are seeking to avoid a cumbersome and unworkable dual responsibility for the provision of places. No one has produced an example to demonstrate that the proposal works. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend pointed out that the only recent example in education circles was shared responsibility for speech therapy. Most of us who are familiar with the provision of speech therapy would agree that it is disastrous. To implement the concept of shared responsibility without even running a pilot scheme to find out whether it will work would be extremely damaging to the prospects of many pupils.<br><br>
I refer to Cambridgeshire county council and the two large secondary comprehensive schools that I mentioned earlier, Soham and Impington village colleges. In response to my intervention, the Minister spoke about Conservative voters in Labour-controlled authorities having little choice. However, in the area to which I refer, most are Conservative voters in a Conservative-controlled authority. They will be affected if 10 per cent. of parents in the entire county choose to take their school out of LEA control. It will not be a democratic process in which 50 per cent. of parents vote to take their schools out of LEA control; 10 per cent. will be sufficient.<br><br>
At four large and successful secondary schools in Cambridgeshire the governors voted against a parental ballot, including Hinchingbrook school in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), the Prime Minister. The parents and governors made a choice and decided to remain with the LEA.<br><br>
The Government assume that a grey uniformity is imposed on all LEA controlled schools. That is simply not the case. Impington village college has fairly high GCSE scores—a pass rate from A to C grades of 43 per cent., which is well above the national average. It also has a special needs unit catering for children with severe disabilities, which is a popular unit in the county. The school was the first in the area to offer the international baccalaureate as a qualification.<br><br>
It also has a formidable record in the performance arts. It is a good example of an LEA school whose parents,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
pleased with the choice and diversity on offer, have voted to stay within the LEA. The parents of those children, who have voted in a shire county, want their school to receive its fair share of financial support through a local LEA in which they believe. The Minister must bear that in mind and not let those parents be influenced by the 10 per cent. of parents who may vote in the rest of the county to take their schools away from LEA control.<br><br>
I have one further point that no one else in Committee has raised as far as I remember. Parents of grant-maintained school pupils have voted positively, either to prevent their schools being closed, or because they are so desperate for funds that they see it as the only way of obtaining sufficient finance to enable that school continue the type of education provision to which they considered their children entitled. What they have not voted for is the transfer of democratic accountability from an LEA to a remote funding agency, which will be answerable only to the Secretary of State. They are not making that choice; it is being imposed upon them—in some instances after the vote has been cast. I am sure that if parents held a ballot on such transfer, they would reject the idea overwhelmingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall wind up briefly because arguments have been made eloquently by colleagues who have contributed since the Minister spoke. His remarks confirmed our worst fears about his intentions for this part of the Bill. He was brazen in his contempt for democracy and the principles of accountability that are essential to education legislation.<br><br>
The Minister was hardly reassuring about the implementation of good education through the mechanisms that he is establishing. He gave us one item of information: the funding agency is likely to be staffed by his former civil servants, which shows, in part, contempt for people with experience of implementing education locally.<br><br>
The Minister's comments confirmed our fears about the remoteness of the funding agency. Its decisions will be based on information submitted on paper. If that is all that happens, as the Minister implied, it is clear that decisions will be made in Whitehall by a bureaucratic funding authority. That will conflict with the present principle of democratic accountability. Everything that the Minister said this morning makes a recipe for chaos. None of it allows for strategic planning locally and it will still result in inefficiency because of duplication.<br><br>
The Minister accused us of attempting, through our amendments, to undermine clause 7 and the Bill. He said that that could be a wrecking move. I am sure, Mr. Martin, that you would not have selected our amendments had their purpose been to wreck. Some of our earlier amendments were ruled out of order because they sought to protect the role of LEAs by stating that nothing in clause 1 should prejudice that role. They were considered wrecking amendments. We consider that the Bill's aim is to prejudice that role.<br><br>
Our amendments, far from wrecking the clause, would make it workable in practice because although we dislike it, the amendments would resolve some of the conflicts that will arise from its drafting. The Minister closed his mind to those issues before he came to Committee today. I fear that clause 7, as the Minister wishes it to stand, will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
create many problems. It will bring chaos and inefficiency to our education system. Therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending my hon. Friends to vote on this critical issue on which the Minister has failed to provide an answer.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 3, leave out lines 27 and 28.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 82, in page 3, line 27, leave out from first 'to' to end of line 28 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'the education of any specified age group'.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>No. 142, in page 3, leave out lines 45 and 46.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of helpful amendments would clarify the sectors of education to which clause 7 will apply. Subsection (1)(b) provides that an order may relate to
<br><blockquote><p>"primary education, to secondary education or to both."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 82 would remove that wording and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"the education of any specified age group"</p></blockquote>
In the spirit of diversification, of which Conservative Members approve so strongly, different types of organisations have developed in areas controlled by LEAs. In its information on form 7, thge DFE has included 40 categories, ranging from first school to sixth-form colleges to myriad descriptions such as middle-deem primary, middle-deem secondary, middle-deem combined. The list is endless.<br><br>
The list shows the various arrangements developed by LEAs that have tried to react to the needs, demands and opinions in their areas since the passing of the Education Act 1944. We start from a point of agreement: the arrangements include excellent and problematic parts. I do not claim that any set-up or organisation within a LEA is better than another. I applaud the diversity that LEAs have allowed to develop.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Line 28 of clause 7 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"an order may relate to primary education, to secondary education or to both."</p></blockquote>
It is not clear what will happen to middle schools if primary and secondary schools reach the 10 per cent. trigger point. If a middle school votes to opt out, will its votes contribute to the total of the primary or the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
secondary sector? They cannot contribute to the middle sector. If I were a Conservative Member the obvious answer would be to add the votes to the form 7 category in which the school is included for the collection of information. That worries me. The votes in middle schools could push the total votes in primary schools beyond the 10 per cent. entry or the 75 per cent. exit point. I hope that the Minister shares my anxiety that votes in the middle school sector could remove from the primary sector the right to decide its future. The amendments would empower the primary, middle and secondary sectors to decide their own future.<br><br>
Our amendments would provide for the Secretary of State to make orders for "any specified age group". The Bill's provisions would be unchanged for those areas where there are no middle schools. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State did not have to deem middle schools to be primary or secondary schools in the 40 areas where middle school provision exists. There is a rationale for middle schools. By definition, the ages of middle school pupils correspond to those of some children in primary and secondary schools. The Bill detracts from the importance of middle school education. The amendments would give middle schools the same rights as primary and secondary schools under clause 7. They would give the Secretary of State the power to make orders for specified age groups.<br><br>
The Bill will cause problems for middle schools. A school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth sought to opt out because it was threatened with closure by that fine organisation of which the hon. Gentleman was a member, Warwickshire county council. According to the local press, when Warwickshire county council sought to close what is now Avon Valley school because of surplus places, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth led the fight for it to obtain grant-maintained status. I believe that he brought teachers from the school to meet the Secretary of State to help the school to fight the plans for closure proposed by that eminent body, Warwickshire county council.<br><br>
When we discussed schools that try to evade closure by seeking grant-maintained status, little did we know—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way yet. Take your seat, please. Classes were well controlled in my day. Little did we know that in our midst was an hon. Member who had actively taken part in finding a way to prevent a democratically elected county council carrying out its plans to remove surplus places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman will forgive me, I shall give way when I have made my next point. I am more worried about what happened after Avon Valley school had evaded closure by seeking grant-maintained status. It was a school for 12 to 16-year-olds, within the borough of Rugby. It sought permission to change its status by admitting children from the age of 11 although it was in an area that has a middle-school system. Because transfer to a senior school is at 12, for Avon Valley school—like Ash Green school in Warwickshire—to take children from the age of 11 throws the educational provision in that area into chaos. They are pinching children from the top year of middle schools. It is difficult for middle schools to continue
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
to provide a coherent, planned education when they lose some of their senior class to schools that have changed the age of their intake to 11.<br><br>
It is a welcome change that there has been far more co-operation in recent years between junior middle and secondary schools about the transfer of children from one sector to another. In many areas, the curricula are meshed so that children are not at a disadvantage when they move from one sector to another. The impact on effective transition from primary to secondary or middle school if half the class move at 11 and half at 12 can only be imagined. While I welcome the diversity of school sectors within the LEAs, I deplore the running of three systems within one authority. That is as bad as the funding agency and the LEA trying to run schools between them. I give way to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Lady now finds it convenient to give way.<br><br>
The hon. Lady is aware that two secondary schools in my constituency have closed. When Avon Valley acquired grant-maintained status, Wolston high school was closed. That proposal was made by the then Labour-controlled authority. I supported Avon Valley in its successful application for grant-maintained status because it meant additional choice for the parents living in and around Rugby. I believe in and encourage choice and diversity. I want parents to have the widest possible choice of schools for their children. Unlike the hon. Lady, I believe that most parents know best what is right for their children.<br><br>
The hon. Lady will recall that Warwickshire county council is considering transfer at age 11, a proposal that is in its consultation document. Avon Valley is merely exercising its own view and testing the water, which is admirable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should know that interventions are supposed to be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I would have intervened earlier and dealt with the hon. Lady's first point and intervened again in response to her second point. However, the hon. Lady—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that, if he wants to respond to the hon. Lady, he can make a contribution to the debate and speak to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
The most interesting aspect of the ramble that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was that it made it clear that it took Labour control of Warwickshire county council for the problem of surplus places to be tackled. Warwickshire county council had been run by the Conservatives for 95 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not, because of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I know that the hon. Lady would not wish to mislead the Committee. I must say gently that it is not accurate to say that Warwickshire county council had been Conservative-controlled for 95 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then the number is 99.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Warwickshire county council was under Conservative control for a far shorter period than 90-odd years. For the majority of the past 99 years, it was under the control of independents.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: She was looking ahead and anticipating 99 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I should tell the hon. Lady and other new members on the Committee that it is a Committee convention that hon. Members give way during debate. That might be helpful for her to know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear that I intended to give way, but thought that it would be helpful to the Committee and to you, Mr. Martin, if I made both points about Rugby in one go. I merely sought the hon. Gentleman's co-operation to enable him to have a good long go rather than two short ones. Now, however, I am sorry that I did so.<br><br>
I return to amendment No. 82, which is crucial. I apologise for straying from it, but I thought the examples interesting. They showed what confusion can be caused in education provision by middle schools. One cannot argue that the water can be tested by allowing one school to move to entry at 11 years old: if one is to move from middle schools, it must be done in one fell swoop, otherwise it will be ineffective. It is thus no excuse to argue—I think that the hon. Gentleman was not seriously doing so—that Avon Valley school was helping the LEA by testing transfer at 11 years old.<br><br>
Too little attention is given in the Bill to the special situation of middle schools, as well as to the problems to which they can give rise. Many LEAs that operate middle schools will be unclear how middle schools will be treated when a funding agency has influence and control within a local authority area.<br><br>
Amendment No. 82 is not a wrecking amendment; it would not lessen the role of the funding agencies; it would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
not remove any of the funding agencies' powers; it would not increase the local education authorities' powers. It would clarify the Bill by removing the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"primary education, to secondary education or to both"</p></blockquote>
because that does not mirror the organisation of education provision, and replacing it with the wide-ranging, but tight, phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"the education of any specified age group".</p></blockquote>
Clause 7 could then deal effectively with every area of the country. As the clause stands, many will be unsure how they will be dealt with.<br><br>
I am happy to have moved the amendments, which would add clarity and purpose to clause 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the amendments would not achieve clarity. The hon. Lady made slightly heavy weather of them. She well knows that it is well-established that middle schools are deemed as either secondary or primary schools. Therefore, there need be no confusion whatsoever for the purposes of voting or any other educational planning regarding the identification of different sorts of schools. Further, if the amendments were accepted, as I shall recommend that they are not, they would produce uncertainty and an entirely unacceptable variation in educational standards across the country and LEAs.<br><br>
Therefore, I strongly urge the Committee to reject the amendments, which do not have the validity attributed to them by the hon. Lady.</span></p>
