	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 386, in page 15, line 39, after first 'the', insert 'exclusive'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 516, in page 15, line 39, after second 'the', insert 'sole'.</p>
	<p>No. 517, in page 15, line 42, after 'authority', insert 'solely'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would help to clarify the position of a school that became grant maintained by including the word "exclusive" in clause 30(2)(a). What 12cconstitutes school premises is not clear. The Department of Education wrote to Gloucestershire county council in December 1990, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no clear definition of what constitutes 'school premises'".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would help to make clear that a grant-maintained school should not necessarily take over all the land and buildings on a school campus. Many schools are not used exclusively for education, but include youth facilities, and adult and community centres, which operate on the school campus under the aegis of the local education authority. Those centres provide a service to the community beyond that for which Education Acts provide, and beyond the statutory provision of education for children between the ages of five and 19. We hope that the Government will respond positively to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 296 and 297 suggest that the Government acknowledge that there may be disputes about what should be part of a grant-maintained school. I shall examine what constitutes school premises, what should be allocated to a school that becomes grant maintained and what should remain under LEA control. We have tried to make the clause more precise by including the word "exclusive" in subsection (2)(a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that every member of the Committee has one or more schools, especially secondary ones, in his or her constituency, which offer youth and community facilities. Cynffig comprehensive school in my constituency has a youth wing and some parts of the main school building are used for the same purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barry boys' comprehensive school, where I used to work, had a youth wing on the school campus. I was a
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
member of the Vale of Glamorgan borough council in the early 1970s. The council entered into a joint agreement with South Glamorgan county council to develop community facilities, to upgrade the swimming pool and to build a new community centre on the site of Llantwit Major comprehensive school. Those joint-use facilities were developed because of the efficient use of resources by two tiers of local government which ensured that the community was even better served by the councils than before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases, there have been disputes between grant-maintained schools and the LEA about what is school land and what is owned by the local authority. In Leeds, 50 school playing fields are also used for community activities but clarification is needed about whether the playing fields should stay under local authority ownership and be used by the school during the day and by the public at weekends and in the evenings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some disputes have been resolved satisfactorily: the site of the City of Leeds school and the Notre Dame school, which became a sixth-form college, independent of the local authority, had a sports hall built 50 years ago, which was the subject of discussion about its use. The freehold was kept by the local authority and a user agreement was reached with the Notre Dame college, which was happy with that arrangement. However, if it had not been satisfied it might have challenged the local authority and the sports hall might have become that college's property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A campus in Milton Keynes was home to two schools, a sports centre and other leisure facilities, which were used by the public on evenings and at weekends. In that case, the grant-maintained school was given the freehold and the local authority granted a 99-year lease on the site. I believe that that arrangement should have been the other way round, but it shows that there are disputes about such matters. That is why it is essential that the Bill makes it clear that the property or land that is transferred to a grant-maintained school is used exclusively by that school and has no other general youth or community purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put one side of the argument. We are not discussing sections of school buildings that are no longer used by the school, but are perhaps used by adult education classes. The amendment relates specifically to those buildings and assets that are used by the school, the school governors and so on. If the hon. Gentleman's amendment were passed, it would exclude any asset or property which was jointly shared because they would remain owned by the LEA. How would he resolve the difficulties that might occur for a school if an awkward LEA or successor declined to give it the justifiable use of the property to which it had become accustomed? That difficulty is not addressed in his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, such disputes are resolved by the Education Assets Board, but I accept that the procedures are not clear. On occasions the board has supported a grant-maintained school's call for ownership of a jointly used property, but, on others, it has given the freehold to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) asked what would happen about the use of part of a school campus over which the local authority had control if that authority tried to stop a grant-maintained school from using it. When I taught at Barry boy's comprehensive school, the youth wing was used during the day by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
school for various activities. If that school were to become grant-maintained and the youth wing were to remain owned by the local authority, because it had a use for it beyond that of the school, and that authority tried to stop the school from using it, I suggest that other parts of the Bill—Government amendments Nos. 296 and 297—would cover the point made by the hon. Member for Battersea. Those amendments are designed to ensure that agreements are reached over property and that disputes should be referred to the Secretary of State, should it get to that position. If the Bill fails to cover the problem that the hon. Gentleman raised about a local authority or, alternatively, a grant-maintained school being vindictive over the use of a particular part of their property there must be a provision for such disputes to be resolved. I believe that that will be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dispute could come from either side: a local authority may refuse to allow a grant-maintained school to make use of a previous joint-user facility or that school may prevent a joint-user facility being used by another group, if it held the freehold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school goes grant-maintained and there is, within its' boundaries, land or property that is used by others—for example, public use of facilities such as playing fields or a youth wing—there should be specific provision for that not to become the school's property but remain with the LEA, subject to a joint-user agreement. If there is no such agreement the matter should be referred to the Secretary of State or some other body to be resolved. I imagine that, ultimately, an appeal would be made to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, but I assume that included in the hon. Gentleman's definition of exclusions would be those parts of schools that were used specifically for adult education. If that were so, would not that effectively make a transfer of assets to a grant-maintained school difficult? Many schools, especially secondary schools are used for adult education. Is that what the hon. Gentleman's amendment intended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not exactly, I do not know the specifics of the case. In certain instances where LEAs run adult or further education classes in schools, a nominal charge is made for the use of classrooms and facilities. In those instances, the school is being used by the LEA for continuing purposes. Most cases that I have in mind involve separately built facilities such as a youth wing, a community centre, a sports hall or, more generally, playing fields associated with a sports hall that are used regularly by the community at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clear provision for the working of this idea would be required—perhaps in schedule 11.1 mention the schedule because paragraph 5, which relates to the amendment of section 42(1)(b) of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, would cover the points that I raise. I would be interested to know whether that is the Government's intention because it may be difficult to reach a decision on schools with dual use. I have sought to relate my amendment to separate facilities that are used mainly for some other purpose than statutory education, such as a youth wing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the explanation, and the intention of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. But I
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
would have thought that my point about adult education use would come under the umbrella of his amendment and that would make it difficult to transfer the property to a new grant-maintained school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessarily so. With a youth wing, it can be shown that the LEA built it on the school premises but for a purpose not covered by the statutory provision of education for children between the ages of five and 19. From my experience of school classrooms used for adult education, I think it can be shown that the local authority was buying the space in the school for a purpose that did not come within the statutory provision of education for children, so the school would not be covered by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment in schedule 11 to the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 covers the point that I am trying to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the distinction that those bodies use the school's facilities whereas the school uses community facilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a useful definition and could help us to overcome any drafting problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 30(1)(a) refers to "any local authority". My hon. Friend may care to consider the difference between a local education authority and a local authority. In my constituency of Hyndburn the Norden high school has a new sports and leisure facility that was partly funded by the LEA, which is part of the county, and partly by the Hyndburn district council. If that school chose to become grant maintained, why should that asset, paid for by the district council for the use of the community in the evenings, be transferred to a GM school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a relevant point. That school is in the same position as the Llantwit Major comrehensive school to which I referred. In the mid-1970s the Vale of Glamorgan borough council, of which I was a member, and South Glamorgan county council together contributed funds to improve the facilities of the campus for the community at large. The Vale of Glamorgan borough council, which is not an education authority, could have used its money to build a community centre elsewhere in the town, but it decided to build it on the school site for joint use because that is a more efficient use of money and a more effective provision of facilities for the community. Our amendment is designed to deal with such situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an adult education college had built a facility attached to a school or had notionally bought from the school rooms which were surplus to the school's requirements or if some other part of the council, such as technical services, had taken over a section of the school that was surplus to the education department's requirements, none of those facilities would remain under the school's governing body. The clause deals with properties controlled by the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would insert the word "exclusive"—not "most" or "a majority" or "a minority". If a junior first aid course or a Brownies meeting were held in one room of the school for one hour a week, under the amendment the whole school would cease to be subject to the Bill because it would be exempt as its use would not be "exclusive". That is my concern about the wording of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his desire to seek clarity. I am pleased about that. Unlike the

	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
Government, I am briefed not by a civil servant but by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) who has great knowledge and experience of these matters. In the tradition of Ministers I shall pick up my hon. Friend's note. The legal distinction is that a building covered by the school premises regulations is clearly the property of a school when it becomes grant-maintained, whereas a building, such as a youth wing, that is not covered by those regulations, would not be part of that school's property. Several Conservative Members have expressed concern about amendment No. 386. I should be happy for the Government to redraft it to retain its spirit, although amendments Nos. 296 and 297 are designed to overcome disputes over the use of property within the boundaries of a grant-maintained school. I hope that the Government will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The list of amendments selected for debate later today refers to amendments No. 325, which relates to schedule 2. Is that not a typographical error, and should not the amendment selected for debate be amendment No.525?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is right. I am grateful to him for pointing that out. That amendment should read as amendment No. 525.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Battersea and other Conservative Members that a strict interpretation of amendment No. 386 may cause problems for the acquisition of land and buildings by grant-maintained schools. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), who tabled the amendment, will agree with me that the intention is not to prevent schools that seek grant-maintained status from claiming their right to ownership and maintenance obligations in respect of the buildings in which they offer full-time education. However, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools, who is listening to this debate from the Back benches this morning, has often said that he does not want the terms of the Bill to be too tight. We have often tabled amendments that would tighten the Bill, and his response has been very much along the lines of. "Oh well, give and take, we all know what we mean".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the amendment is to be adapted by the Government, it is vital that we remedy a current problem in the transfer of property and buildings to grant-maintained schools. The position must be clarified regardless of the precise wording that is used. I shall recount an example from Birmingham. Schedule 10 of the Education Reform Act 1988, deals with the transfer of land and buildings to grant-maintained schools. A major dispute has arisen in connection with the Great Barr grant-maintained school. When the Small Heath school achieved grant-maintained status under the 1988 Act, the dual-use facilities remained in the ownership of the local authority. An agreement between Small Heath school and Birmingham city council has been drawn up and works very well, with no objections to its operation from either party. Conservative Members spoke about recalcitrant local authorities, but the evidence shows that there have been no problems in the implementation of joint agreements drawn up after the transfer of assets to grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Birmingham city council built a large sports centre and recreation ground at the Great Barr school. That is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
dual-use site. The details are interesting. The hall was built in 1984 and cost £1 million. That money came from the leisure services committee, not the education committee. The hall is managed by the recreation and community services department, not the LEA. The recreation ground was not provided under the Education Act 1944. The community uses the sports hall and recreation ground more than the school. However, school use of those facilities, in school time and for extra-curricular activities, is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed inconceivable that the ownership of the recreation ground and sports hall should be transferred to Great Barr school, but that happened under the provisions of the 1988 Act. I am sure that schools and governing bodies that seek grant-maintained status do not intend to provide community services. No Conservative Member could argue that a governing body of a grant-maintained school would manage or provide community leisure facilities better than a council. However, grant-maintained schools will have to manage such facilities if the decision about Great Barr school sets a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A carnival, and Saturday and Sunday league football take place at the recreation ground. I, and people outside the House, did not believe that legislation would provide for grant-maintained schools to remove community facilities from council management. If Great Barr school can do that, something is wrong. Not only Birmingham city council opposed the decision about Great Barr, but Birmingham Sports Advisory Council, the West Midlands Council for Sports and Recreation and the Central Council for Physical Recreation, objected. None of those organisations wish to wreck measures that provide for grant-maintained education. However, they have protested to the Government that transferring ownership of land and sports facilities from councils to grant-maintained schools will jeopardise community and leisure facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the grave consequences of preventing a site from retaining a dual use. Peter Lawson, who is general secretary of the CCPR, said in his letter to the Secretary of State that if the decision on Great Ban-school was carried through,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the city council would feel duty bound to divert its expenditure away from maintaining a recreational resource that was no longer genuinely open to public use."</p></blockquote>
Birmingham city council has 22 schools with dual-use sites. Expenditure on them averages £60,000 a year. The city council will not continue to spend that money as well as money from its capital programme, if it loses ownership of the site. If it continued to do so, it would neglect its obligations to the community in Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Lady knows that Peter Lawson is mainly worried about the loss of playing fields. His usual targets are local authorities that have sold playing fields right, left and centre—I mean that geographically, not politically. He is trying to protect Great Barr playing field, as he would try to protect any other. The issue of grant-maintained schools is not germane to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the council approached school governors to make an arrangement, perhaps by contract, to ensure that it will continue to be able to use the facilities for activities in which it wishes to invest for the future? What negotiations have taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The citizens and poll tax payers of the city of Birmingham would be appalled if, having paid for the facilities and the capital costs and while continuing to cover the revenue implications, they are then told that they must pay the school to use the facilities that their money has built. It is no good pretending that ownership is not a crucial issue. We can sort out dual use: reasonable people can come to an agreement about who uses the facilities and when. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, if they cannot, we can make provision to overcome those disputes, but the ownership of the facilities is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper issued by the DFE in August last year invited grant-maintained schools to make bids for capital moneys. It specifically excluded bids for sports halls and facilities, saying, in effect, "Don't waste your time filling in the forms because we are not going to give you the money." Given that that avenue to apply for such facilities is closed to grant-maintained schools, I am worried that they may try to obtain ownership of the building while seeking grant-maintained status. The hon. Member for Battersea is right about Peter Lawson and his worry about councils selling recreation land. There is anxiety that, with the present shortage of money in education for capital building, in future Great Barr may think that by selling some of the land or buildings it will have more money to repair the school or to build a classroom extension. It is possible that the citizens of Birmingham, having paid for and maintained the building, will find that it is to be sold by the school, which will keep the money, rather than it return to the citizens of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection if a school wants to use its capital money to build a smashing leisure centre, to acquire land for recreational use and put in the effort involved in spending the money, doing the work and running the facilities. It might then gain extra income by asking the council if it wants to use the leisure centre and pay rent to do so. However, I do object to land and recreation facilities that have been paid for by the citizens of Birmingham being transferred to a grant-maintained school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could argue that most of the money would have come from central taxation, but that is a side issue. Does the hon. Lady accept that there is a distinction between playing fields, a swimming pool and other facilities that are integral to a school and a sports facility such as the hall, for example, which may have been built with the specific intention that it will be used as a community facility to which the school can have access during the school day?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous Acts have transferred the assets of schools, which this Bill would do. The hon. Lady must accept that there is no particular distinction between the sports hall, the gymnasium, the playground and the field and so on. However, there may be a distinction in relation to the extra facilities. That is when the Education Assets Board would have to come to an agreement because the intention when the hall was built was that it was for the community, rather than being for the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was helpful. At Great Barr, the situation is that what were the school playing fields now have a dual use: a sports hall was built on a recreation ground that was not formerly part of the school. I believe that The Great Barr school playing fields, used for soccer, rugby and hockey are separate from the recreation ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy for the hon. Lady's argument. However, we should not be too rigid in our consideration of measures. There will be a division of assets between grant-maintained schools and LEAs or local authorities that previously may have provided leisure facilities at such schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to talk about cases in which a clearly defined, separate leisure facility has been provided by the leisure service committee and say that such a facility should remain for community use and that it should not be used exclusively by the school or even under its control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know Perry Common school in Birmingham well. It is next to Great Barr school. The facility there was provided by the school, originally for its exclusive use. However, as the dual-use philosophy developed, leisure services began to put a lot of money into the facility to bring it up to a standard that was appropriate for community use. In that example, there is no clear distinction between the use of a facility by the school or the community. Therefore, the Government are right to table amendments No. 296 and 297 as a means of ensuring that the division of spoils is done in a sensible and pragmatic way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) has drawn a distinction between two schools in Birmingham, but the fact remains that the Bill means that the council will lose ownership of the vital facilities at Great Barr school. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has indicated that perhaps that should not happen. The Education Assets Board has considered the case and has granted the sports hall and recreation ground to the school. Birmingham city council assumed two years ago that, because the 1988 Act provids that ownership of such a facility should rest with the body that uses it most, once statutory functions have been carried out, ownership of the Great Barr facility would be awarded to the community, as happened at Small Heath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill must be changed to protect councils from losing such facilities, for which they have paid over the years. Unless there is a change, the practice of councils having dual use of such sites will end. I applaud the local authorities of Birmingham and Coventry which have been imaginative even in times of scarce money and resources. In the old days, a brand new sports hall would have been built 100 yards down the road from the school, and everybody would have said, "Tut, tut, tut, why does one department not speak to another? What is the point of having a school open from 9 am to 4 pm and sports hall open from 4 pm to 9 pm?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are at one in calling for better use of resources. I applaud local authorities that have adopted the dual-use approach, but councils must be offered some protection from the actions of the Education Assets Board, which may seek to take away from them the ownership of the land. The Great Barr example is a trial case. On it rests the future of communty and leisure provision in local authorities throughout the country. We have an opportunity to amend the Bill to ensure that councils are encouraged to continue the dual-use approach and to make the most economic use of resources. They should not fear that they will let down their local taxpayers by spending money on facilities whose ownership they may lose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to emphasise that point. The Bill must contain some protection for local authorities that have provided money for the development of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
joint-user facilities. Otherwise, future local authority joint-user plans will be blighted. It is of the utmost importance that the Great Barr case is resolved and that the Bill makes it clear that a similar disaster cannot happen again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I would go further: if a local authority, now or in the future, were to spend millions of pounds on building a leisure centre or on acquiring sports facilities whose ownership it knew it would lose within five years, it would be acting disgracefully. Local authorities would be fearful of being dragged before the court for wasting money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning, much was made of accountability. Conservative members of the Committee said that school's governors are more accountable than local councillors because they must answer to the parents, and through them, to the pupils. No Conservative Member ever said that they were accountable to the wider community, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argue that, in decisions as to whether a school should be grant maintained, the franchise should extend beyond parents. The Conservatives have never suggested that. To what extent will those who may, in future, provide sports and recreation facilities for the community be accountable to local people? Will local people be allowed to express their opinion about whether their community facilities should be taken out of control of the city council and assumed by the school, and therefore by the funding council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me pursue the point that the hon. Lady said had not been made. I do not know why she assumes that the governors of a grant-maintained school do not regard themselves and the schools as part of the larger community. Many grant-maintained schools work within the community and provide facilities. No doubt my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education will provide examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem so sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence that my hon. Friend will produce a strong and firm case to refute entirely the considered views of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris). I feel confident that the grant-maintained schools will accept responsibilities that the community gives them and discharge them in an acceptable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Lady has expressed those views. With respect, she is local government-orientated and sees all virtue flowing from local authorities. I put it to her gently that virtue also flows from other bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to have accepted our argument. Schools are indeed part of the wider community. I taught at a community college for some years. The hon. Gentleman must now accept the logic of our argument that, if a school is part of the wider community, it is for that community to decide whether that school should become grant maintained or stay within LEA control. Conservative Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that the school is part of the wider community as well as arguing, "Ah well, there is community and there is community. Some people who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
part of the community are more important and may vote on what a school's future should be; the others are part of the community, too but not quite part enough to have a vote." I would not wish to be asked to be a member of a Standing Committee that decides which part of a community gets a vote and which does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady accept that a good school, irrespective of type, will seek to be part of the community? Is not it true that unless a school attracts pupils, and arouses the interest of business, professional and other leaders in a community, with a view to getting them to be members of its governing body, it will not be considered successful? Almost by definition, members of the governing body of a school will be interested in being part of a community, gaining high repute in it and bringing it as close as possible to the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has confirmed what the committee has been discussing for the past 20 minutes. It is in the interests of both parties—the council and the grant-maintained school—to draw up an agreement that states that anybody who wishes to use the facilities can do so on a reasonable basis. I am in accord with the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is crucial because of the ownership of the buildings and the land. There is no good trying to pretend that that is unimportant. There is the problem of the future disposal of assets and democratic and financial accountability; local authorities should not invest heavily in dual-use sites using money contributed by all citizens from the area when they know that control and ownership of that site may be taken from their grasp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not about questioning whether an acceptable agreement can be drawn up—it can. Please let us have an amendment to the clause that offers protection to far-sighted councils such as Birmingham, which has gone along the road of dual-use provision. Birmingham wants to make community facilities available not only to children under 18 but to people throughout the community. It has a proven record of working co-operatively with all institutions in the community to make the most of the facilities in the area. It is vital for local authorities up and down the country to do the same. I hope that the amendment will find favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which clause 30 is worded means that, when a school is granted grant-maintained status, all facilities, properties and buildings used by it will be transferred to the control of the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there are two joint-use schools. One was purpose built as a joint-use facility 17 years ago and the other developed through the evolution of a far-sighted community-based provision. I shall describe what is in the purpose-built facility and how it was founded and a problem in the wording of the amendment will emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first facility has a complex consisting of a sports centre, a swimming pool, four tennis courts, two squash courts, a theatre and a bar. They are used in the day by the school and at night there is a joint-use agreement that allows the public to use them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case we get stories in the tabloids, may I clarify that the bar is not used in the day, by the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The bar is an integral part of the facilities; it is adjacent to the gymnasium and overlooks the swimming pool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facility was funded under a tripartite agreement between Warrington development corporation, Cheshire county council and Warrington borough council. They all contributed to the capital costs of the scheme and, until the demise of the development corporation, they all contributed to the revenue costs. The revenue costs are now borne by Cheshire county council and Warrington borough council and there is money endowed from the Warrington new town development corporation, for its continuing contribution to the community, for the next 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the unamended clause is passed, who will control that school? The control will pass to the governing body. That is wrong: it is asset-stripping of the first degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman join me in deprecating the attitude of the mainly Labour-controlled authorities that prevent children of grant-maintained schools from using local authority facilities? There are many examples of that happening up and down the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is the tradition to give way, but I knew that it would be a spurious intervention, which would have nothing to do with my point. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a speech, giving his examples, I am sure that you, Mr. Martin, will give him the opportunity to tell us of them. If the hon. Gentleman says that such examples exist, I deprecate them. At least the Opposition recognise that, if things are wrong, they should be acknowledged and addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another problem. A community school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Mr. Hoyle) has a library that is used jointly by the school and by the community in Birchwood under the county council's library service. Under the clause, that library would be controlled by the school, which would be able to do what it liked with it. That is wrong because the library should be managed for the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A primary school in a deprived area of Warrington—also in my hon. Friend's constituency—has received money from Warrington borough council to develop facilities that can be used by the community. If that primary school became grant maintained, what would happen to the council's investment? The governing body would control it. The Government must not allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is unacceptable to the Government, I hope that they will recognise the problem and be prepared to deal with it. If they do not, the provision of joint-use facilities, which are the most efficient use of community resources, will dry up. Local authorities, such as Warrington borough council, will not invest money in schools for community facilities if they believe that those schools will opt out, take the benefits of that investment with them and thus deprive the community of those facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
The protection to which my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley referred is essential. I am sure that the Government do not want these problems to occur, so I hope that the Minister will allay our fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning's debate has highlighted the difficulties that may arise when deciding how assets are to be distributed once a school has achieved grant-maintained status. Our amendment and the two Government amendments try to deal with the problem. Hon. Members have given examples of the possible problems. Those problems arise because in the past few years, we have been successful in encouraging dual and community use of important, expensive facilities. We should compliment local communities and local authorities on the positive steps that they have taken to ensure the more efficient and effective use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school in my constituency with large premises had surplus capacity because of a falling roll. An agreement was reached whereby certain buildings were turned over to the social services and leisure departments. The leisure department provided a library which now functions as a school library and as a library for community use. Social services provided a day centre for old people in co-operation with Age Concern, and a pre-school provision. The social services provision would not be covered by clause 30, but as part of the school's academic programme, pupils taking personal and social development visit the day centre and the nursery during their course, so it could be argued that the property is being used for education purposes. I am concerned that as a course of study is being held in those premises for a few hours a week, those facilities would be caught by clause 30 as presently worded. The Government amendments do not go far enough to satisfy me that adequate protection would be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the course to which the hon. Gentleman refers organised by the education establishment of the school governors or is it an adult education course, which is the responsibility of the adult education governors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to clarify that. It is a Business and Technician Education Council general course, which is taken by fourth and fifth formers in the school. It is an excellent, practical and beneficial course, which is promoted by the school. If the Minister has time, I am sure that the school would welcome him if he wished to take a look at it.The course is a social services provision, but the school uses it as part of its course development for pupils. I am not satisfied that the Government amendments would remedy the problems of clause 30. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the point that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the new Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education to the Committee. I apologise for having to ask him to refer specifically to circumstances in Wales when he responds to the debate.

Recreation and leisure facilities in Wales are provided by district and county councils. If local government reorganisation occurs in Wales, and unitary authorities are formed, the position will be simpler. However, the Bill will be implemented before that happens. Schools that become grant maintained will, under the present system, have to negotiate with both district and county councils. A sophisticated provision of recreation and leisure services
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
exists in Wales. For example, in my borough of Torfaen, comprehensive school sites in Fairwater, Llantarnam and Abersychan include leisure facilities for the community such as swimming pools and recreation halls. The district and county councils jointly fund those facilities. I am convinced that those schools will not become grant maintained, but if they do, what will happen to those facilities before the unitary authorities take over?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Timothy Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say what a pleasure and privilege it is to appear for the first time in Committee under your Chairmanship, Mr. Martin? I hope that you will not need to make me stand in the corner too often, but I am a diffident new boy. It is a pleasure to participate in the debate. I have responsibility for further and higher education and I am glad to be able to discuss schools as well. My wife trained as a teacher. I believe that an Education Minister without an interest in schools is like fish without chips, and should not be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points of agreement in Committee. I am sure that we can use them as a basis for further discussion in what has been a useful and civilised debate. First, dual or multiple use of school premises is desirable, where sensible. The hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) spoke eloquently about high-quality provision. The hon. Member for Wallsend, whose offer I should be delighted to accept, described the sensible and sensitive use of a school in his constituency. There are such cases in my constituency. My brother-in-law is a community school head in Cambridgeshire. Such provision makes educational sense and is a good use of assets, where appropriate. No one wishes to frustrate or complicate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we agree that a ring fence cannot easily be built round a school. The late Clem Attlee remains my favourite leader of the Labour party. He was once asked to define a concept. He said that it is difficult to define an elephant, but one knows what it is when one sees it. Broadly, we know what schools are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite rightly, the Committee has examined the hard cases. Two categories have emerged, although they are somewhat confused. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Bridgend, who was not always sure whether he was talking about two pieces of property on the same site, one used for the purposes of the school and one not, or about pieces of property or other things such as chattels that have a dual use. Schedule 11, which we shall discuss later in our proceedings, may offer a better opportunity for debate on dual use. Clause 30 is primarily concerned with property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dual or multiple use of school premises is agreed to be desirable. In the real world, it is agreed also that a legal transfer requires a sensible working arrangement with a sound legal basis. Having established those principles, the Committee departed slightly from the paths of righteousness over how that might be effected. The four of my hon. Friends who spoke on that matter made short but trenchant contributions, but Opposition Members did not seem to recognise the importance of that requirement. I mean no offence when I say that there seemed to be a certain ignorance about the provisions established in the Education Reform Act 1988. The matter was debated extensively when that Bill was discussed in Standing Committee, of which I was not a member. Some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
concepts developed then, and the creation of the Education Assets Board in that Act have been used to good effect to resolve difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is that the end of the process. The Education Assets Board has the power to refer cases in which it cannot obtain local agreement to the Secretary of State for determination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley argued powerfully that the Education Assets Board did not, under the existing legislation, appear to be as clear as it ought to be about to whom the ownership of the assets should belong. The amendment would tighten the definitions to enable decisions to be made more easily. If the amendment has shortcomings, we should be happy for the Government to produce an alternative wording that would take account of the points raised in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the good faith of the hon. Gentleman's intentions, and have no wish to resile from that. In fact, during the course of our discussion, which was quite long, I debated with myself whether the Opposition Members were playing Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde. I shall touch on the implications and dangers of the amendment in a moment, but I could say that it was designed as a wrecking or frustrating amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea spotted its potential to prevent a smooth transfer to grant-maintained status, but I took the contributions from Opposition Members to be genuine expressions of doubt and anxiety. I hope to clarify the matter to the Committee's satisfaction in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Secretary of State may be called on to determine cases. In doing so, he will have a duty to seek evidence and consider the matter fully. Perhaps I can round off the most eloquent speech from the hon. Member for Yardley by saying that I am aware that the Great Barr matter has been referred to the Secretary of State for determination. If she wishes to make representations to him—legislation and his thousand duties notwithstanding—she should do so, and I am sure that they will be considered. She will understand that I cannot comment because, effectively, the matter is sub judice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was slightly sideways. I must state firmly that there is provision in the 1988 Act, and considerable experience in resolving the disputes. Broadly, that is satisfactory. In circumstances where it is impossible to reach local agreement, the machinery exists to resolve difficulties. In a sense, the debate has been redundant; otherwise it has been useful in bringing to the Committee's attention the difficulties that can arise and the means with which to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going into the detailed issues, perhaps I can answer the question of whether existing grant-maintained schools are capable of showing themselves effective in community use. I was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), who is temporarily absent, to submit evidence. There was a certain scepticism among Opposition Members about whether evidence existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent survey of grant-maintained schools, 42 per cent. increased their community use, and others sustained it. Going grant-maintained is in no sense a prescription for reducing, freezing out or removing community use and may, indeed, be an opportunity to expand it, which would satisfy communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to establish the nature of the community involvement. It could be selling second-hand jewellery or something like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. gentleman's intervention. This is rapidly turning into what he and I know is called stichomythia—a rapid exchange of dialogue as in a Greek drama.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister ought not to quote figures if he knows nothing other than the figures that he quoted, given that each intervention has drawn the response "I don't know." There is little disagreement between us about the ability of everyone to obtain consent to the continued use of facilities. Does he accept that ownership of the buildings is a more crucial issue than who the user is, the percentage of use, where, when and why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the matter of ownership in explaining how the law operates.

I shall take up the hon. Lady's challenge. Identified uses include use as sports pitches by football and lacrosse teams, the use of gym and weights equipment and of swimming pools, and use for adult education purposes and lecturing. I do not have details, but these are not the sort of way-out or Arthur Daley-type uses that worry the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a habit, although not of members of the Committee, to regard the activities of LEAs as always benign and perfect. However, we should remember that LEAs running maintained schools have severe powers and in cases when they hold or use a school property they might well be entitled to do something to that property that is to the detriment of other sections of the community and to local authority interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speculate on that issue because it is not part of the clause. Merely because there arise hard cases that can be determined by the procedure that I outlined earlier, we should not imagine that there is no possibility of hard cases arising under the existing system. There was the case of a school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington), which much distressed my hon. Friend, and which was drawn to my attention, too. However, I shall not dilate that issue. We are trying to find a sensible way smoothly to resolve the transfer of these assets.

mentioned by one or two hon. Members, was not given the appropriate emphasis. Paragraph 1 of schedule 10 of the Education Reform Act 1988 is the text under which these issues are determined. That paragraph includes provisions for dealing with those cases when property is used partly for the school and partly for other local authority purposes. It provides in the first instance for division or apportionment of the property rights and liabilities in such proportions as may be appropriate. We have already referred to the fact that amendments have been tabled that relate to property that should not transfer later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about the hard cases. When the property rights or liabilities are not susceptible to division, paragraph 1(3) of schedule 10 provides for the property to transfer or not, depending on certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of land and buildings, the matter is decided by which of the two parties appears to be in greater need of the security afforded by having a legal interest in the land. Security—It is not a precisely defined term—means who needs protection for the use of the property or land. That is how I understand it, although I am not a lawyer. In cases in which neither side appears to have a greater need for security—where it is a 50:50 ball, to put it in jargon—the property—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if the properties were jointly owned by an LEA and a district council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the district council in a moment. I shall first try to complete this formulation because it is important that we understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then this does not apply to the district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that in a moment. I am outlining the general principle that applies. In the case of the land, we consider first whichever of the two parties appears to be in greater need of security in relation to the activities that are carried on in the building or place. When neither appears to have the greater need of security, the property will go to whichever appears to be likely to make the greater use of the land or buildings. I hope that that is helpful. That will no doubt be a matter for consideration under a determination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the clauses which relate to schedule 10, which the Minister cited. The decision of the Education Assets Board about the school in Great Barr, Birmingham, means that the sports hall and recreation ground would still be transferred to the school, despite what the Minister said. Both the community and the school have equal needs for security—neither group has a greater need because both education and community provision are important—but, the group that makes better use of the facility can be statistically proved to be the community of Great Barr. Against that background—which has not been questioned by the Educational Assets Board or by you today—if the decision is still to give the facility to the school, will the Minister describe an example when it would be given to the local authority? I canot think of a stronger claim than that of the school in Great Barr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, let me point out that it would be better if the hon. Lady did not use the word "you" because that draws me into the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go into the particular case that the hon. Lady raised, but I shall make two points of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
general application. First, there have been cases in which the Education Assets Board—I am not talking about the Secretary of State—has supported the LEA. It is a highly professional organisation and is well qualified to determine which group should be in favour and the cards are not loaded one way or the other. They will study each case and make a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what the hon. Lady said, I remind the Committee of another safeguard. It is not, and has never been, just the matter of the property itself. Where only one party receives the property rights or liability, there is power to make arrangements for the protection of the other party. That is central to the business. It may well be for good order that the property goes in a certain direction. If that happens, there is power to make protective arrangements, which is a powerful safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman makes about paragraph 1(3) of schedule 10. The wording as it stands in the Education Reform Act 1988 is helpful. I am sure that the Minister is aware of at least one example in which his Department was on the side of the LEA, in Calderdale. Through his Department's training and vocational educational initiative, equipment was purchased that was financed by the Department for Education. The equipment was then being used by pupils attending a school that had gone grant-maintained. The view of his Department and of Calderdale LEA was that that equipment was for the use of all children in Calderdale, but the Education Assets Board held that the equipment would be used solely by the grant-maintained schools. One would have thought that the wording of schedule 10 would have ensured that the equipment was to be used by all the children of Calderdale, yet the Education Assets Board said no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I say is that the Education Assets Board—like the Secretary of State and others—is bound by statute and its determinations must be considered in that light, although I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the case to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to discuss other local authorities, as opposed to local education authorities, because they are involved under the clause. Many hon. Members have raised the point that, under the Bill, if the district council holds an interest for the purpose of the school, that interest will transfer. There may be multiple layers of interest in land. For example, it could mean that a lease would transfer, but not the underlying freehold. If the freehold were held by the district council for the school, it would transfer so that the school would have its access protected and could carry out its purposes. The Committee would do well to remember that the aim is to promote the interest of the school and its children. Clearly, it is right that assets that are central to the school's activities are transferred with it, to put the matter in lay terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The joint-use facilities in my constituency were provided by the local education authority and the local district council, which has an interest in the costs of construction and revenue. Does the Minister mean that the rights of the district council over those assets will also be transferred, even though the facilities were provided for community use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will very much depend on the particular circumstances. The Education Assets Board will determine
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
the facts of disputes for which there is no immediate local agreement. The board will no doubt be interested to hear whether a dispute is current in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not it was so intended—I accept that Opposition Members maintain that it was not so intended—the test proposed in the amendment would make it virtually impossible for many schools to achieve grant-maintained status because of property that could be said to be for dual use. Even where there is no such property—in cases where, instead of good will there is an element of obstruction—it would be possible for an LEA to introduce an element of dual use to frustrate the attainment of grant-maintained status. That would be most undesirable. Satisfactory protection has already been provided, as I have described, for other assets and other local authority interests. The concepts developed in the Education Reform Act 1988 and in the work of the Education Assets Board, which aims to find local agreement and which is safeguarded by the fact that the Secretary of State can make the final determination, are appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South. I understood him to say that, where a district council has provided funds for a dual-use facility, the ownership and use of that facility may be determined by the Education Assets Board when a school chooses to opt out. Does the Minister accept that almost certainly that would prevent district councils from making money available in the future for schools that have not become grant maintained, for fear that they will lose control and ownership of facilities if those schools subsequently choose to opt out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A better formulation would be to say that it might prevent district councils from putting money forward unless and until the position of the assets were defined properly in a lease or otherwise. That seems entirely proper. It is up to district councils to make forward grants. If they wish to safeguard their position, the Bill would not prevent them from doing so. It would be a wise decision. I am sure that the Education Assets Board would help them with advice in cases of difficulty, but they could use their own legal advisers. It would be an entirely proper course of action, as no local authority should expend money without a definition of the assets that it controls and those that it is acquiring. The whole tenor of the debate in the Committee made it clear that Opposition Members wanted more precise definitions and attached great importance to ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming more and more worried by the Minister's answers. Is his advice to the Committee that, by definition, a local authority can maintain control of the assets that it has funded? If that is so, will the Minister write a detailed letter to explain how that will work? It is important that joint-use arrangements continue to provide for the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, the district council determines the charges for joint-use facilities and the subsidies for activities. If the application of a joint-use school for grant-maintained status is successful and it retains the joint-use assets, its approach to subsidising community activities will be different from that of the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman's second point first. The clause provided only for the transfer of ownership, not for any other part of the existing agreement. Negotiations at the appropriate time will determine what happens when a school becomes grant-maintained. The grant-maintained school may formulate its own policy for charging for facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Gentleman's first point, the Educational Assets Board will ascertain the current position and try to gain local agreement. My earlier remarks tackled the point made by the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope). I said that it might be necessary for district councils and other bodies to safeguard their position. I shall reflect on the matter and write to the hon. Member for Warrington, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a tried and trusted system for deciding difficult cases. Adequate safeguards exist for the user and other interests. The Committee should reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. When he began to speak, I believed that the Government were prepared to consider the amendment and table a further amendment that reflected our anxieties on Report. The dispute about Great Barr school shows that the system is not tried and trusted and that the Education Assets Board has experienced difficulty in interpreting the 1988 Act. We tabled the amendment to air such problems, which have arisen since the Education Assets Board was created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the early 1980s, I was leader of the district council in Durham, and I had to decide whether to invest in dual use. In view of the problems we have discussed, I am pleased that we decided against it. We invested in five sports centres, which we ran. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's reply signals the end of dual-use provision? In future, no district council will dare to put resources into dual-use provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point about the future. It is not necessarily commendable for district councils to develop sports and recreational facilities exclusively. My hon. Friend's view of the Tory party's drift is percipient. He foresaw the cataclysm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions for the hon. Gentleman. First, does he believe that it is appropriate for local authorities to engage in educational activities? Secondly, why is it not possible for district councils that wish to safeguard facilities for community use to protect their rights not only in statute but in their initial agreements with LEAs on maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up both points. First, the district council is not an education authority; it does not spend money on education, otherwise the district auditor would be round. It provides such facilities under its powers and responsibilities for recreation and leisure. Some authorities provide exclusive facilities so are not embroiled in the arguments arising from the creation of grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, since 1988, there had been no disputes about the joint use of facilities, we would not have had to raise the matter in our amendment. Many bodies are unhappy about what happens in joint user cases when district councils have put money into provision on an LEA site. If everything in the garden had been rosy up till now, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
amendment might not have been necessary, but district councils involved in joint-use facilities are now under pressure whenever there is the prospect of a school becoming grant maintained. When councils made their original agreements with LEAs about the joint use of facilities, there was no question of them ever having to protect their position in case the school was suddenly no longer under the LEA. It is true that since the 1988 Act, district authorities can take account of that possibility when they consider joint user facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may wish to comment further on the Minister's remarks. I know that the Minister is new to his job but he is showing a breathtaking ignorance of what is happening in schools up and down the country. He does not appreciate that there is good co-ordination between LEAs and other local authorities: he does not understand that relationship. Swimming and other recreational activities are the proper responsibility of those authorities that work jointly with LEAs and local schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right about the shadow that has been cast over the development of joint user facilities by the way in which the Education Assets Board has operated in certain cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman ask the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) why, if that co-operation is so active and intimate—I have already said that I accept and welcome that—there cannot be an understanding at the outset of a new activity as to who is responsible and in whom the ownership of those facilities is vested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the problem arises when the ownership of facilities is considered in decisions of the Education Assets Board. Under the Bill, it will be possible for a grant-maintained school to claim buildings that are within the school's boundaries as part of its assets. A leasing or joint user agreement for a certain number of years may be possible, but ownership—if the Great Barr case is an example of the work of the Educational Assets Board—could, even in the clearest cases of proven community use, nevertheless still be granted to the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's answer will not only prevent the joint use of facilities with district authorities, but could also prevent joint use within a local authority if it becomes a unitary authority? It is highly unlikely that a recreation department, even in a unitary authority, would now be prepared to invest in a school's joint use facility if the possibility existed that it could later be passed to a grant-maintained school. The Minister has clearly shown that facilities that will be built for recreation, whether by a district council or a unitary authority's recreation department, will be built solely by that department, and not be part of a joint venture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct, given the example of the decision by the Education Assets Board in the Great Barr case. This matter is currently before the Secretary of State for Education for his decision. Because of the evidence given to him, I can only hope that he will decide that under schedule 10 the EAB has this time made a mistake. Nevertheless, because the EAB could make more such mistakes, we think that a case exists for tighter and clearer legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
The Minister did not comment on whether the definition of "school premises" as covered by the school premises regulations would be useful in resolving disputes over who should have ownership. To use the example given by the hon. Member for Battersea, if the Brownies used a classroom once a week for an hour, that would constitute joint use and prevent ownership. I admit that I had not thought of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the helpful reference to school premises regulations provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend would cover that point, to make it clear that if such an example were covered by the regulations, a decision would fall to the grant-maintained school although in the Warrington case that my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South described, where some facilities were perhaps not in entirely separate buildings, I imagine that the picture would be much more complex. If a youth wing was a separate building in the grounds of a comprehensive school, for example, it would be relatively easy to say that the school itself becomes the property of the grant-maintained school and its governors while the youth wing would become the property of the LEA and that right of access to it would be required—a fairly common feature of property law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that by adding the word "exclusive" we solve all the problems. However, the addition of the word would give us an opportunity to raise an important point in the on-going debate about ownership issues when a school goes grant-maintained. I had hoped that the Minister would be prepared to look again at the matter. Instead, he said that we must trust the Education Assets Board, that satisfactory legislation exists and that there is no need to go further. As for future joint use, the hon. Gentleman said that it will be up to district councils that are not education authorities—or, in unitary authorities, up to the non-education departments—to find a way to provide for joint use in a local authority-maintained school that might later become grant-maintained, so as to protect its ownership of whatever facilities it has on the school site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be establishing a principle whereby a local authority, if it is not an LEA, can maintain ownership of its facilities. Why cannot the same principle be established for existing facilities held by LEAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will consider that. I propose to withdraw the amendment to allow the Government further consideration behind the scenes in the hope that they can either improve on schedule 10 or allow us to come up with more acceptable wording on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 15, line 46, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 297.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments reflect an improvement on the original provisions of the Education Reform Act. They provide for relevant property, including land and buildings, to transfer from the local authority to the school
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
governing body when that school becomes grant-maintained. There is currently no provision in the 1988 Act for governing bodies to decline to take over some property although they may not want it. That can lead to difficulties with the Education Assets Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would provide for some property that would normally transfer—within the earlier definitions—to be excluded from the transfer. An LEA might, for example, be reluctant to embark upon a project that involved the transfer of a split-site school to a single school on a new site if it thought that the school might opt out and take with it both the old and the new sites—and so end up with the cake and the biscuit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would allow the authority and the school to agree in advance that the new sites and buildings should transfer but that the old sites might remain the property of the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would also allow either the governing body of a school approved for grant-maintained status, or the local authority, in the absence of agreement, to apply to the Secretary of State for an order to exclude land or other property from a transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the amendments is that schools and LEAs have raised this topic a number of times in the past few months. It would be good if new governing bodies and local authorities reached sensible agreement over property that can be excluded. In some instances, there may be good reason for property being excluded—such as the example that I cited—even if one party does not agree. It seemed right to advise the Committee that provision for flexibility should be included. In those circumstances the Secretary of State will still have to satisfy himself that the school will be able to carry out its obligations and that the exclusion of the said property will not impair its ability to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are sensible and constructive. They will increase flexibility and make life easier both for LEAs and for new grant-maintained schools. They will help to resolve disputes in particular cases, and they are an improvement on the original concepts. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments, as they will give greater flexibility to future arrangements concerning property that may have given rise to a dispute between an LEA and a school. I welcome the new subsection (4C) especially, which details future arrangements for the management of properties that remain in the hands of the local authority and are thus excluded from transfer to a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going over the ground of the previous debate about dual use, the amendments are significant because, although ownership will be important, so will be the arrangements for pieces of property—swimming pools, recreation centres and so on—which originally may have been provided by a number of different bodies. For example, Bewdley school in my constituency has a recreation centre that is separate from the school. Most of the funds for it were provided by the district council, some by the West Midlands Council for Sport and Recreation and the Sports Council, and some by the county council. At Stourport school, there are plans for a facility on part of the school property that will be funded by the local educational authority, the Sports Council and by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. It is hoped also that funding in future will come from the national lottery. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
point is that such capital improvements will not be funded by any single body, so the issue of ownership will be difficult to gauge, at least in a moral sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those schools become grant maintained, the future arrangements for use of their facilities will be very important. Subsection (4C) refers to future arrangements for use of a property, following an agreement under subsection (4A)—that is, assuming that the property in question does not transfer to the school. Schedule 10 of the Education Reform Act 1988 deals with the division of assets rather than future arrangements for their use. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say whether cases where property is transferred to a school but where arrangements are made for the use of those assets by the local community are also covered? Although ownership would be transferred to the school beyond peradventure, would the school be obliged to ensure that the purposes for which the assets were constructed—and for which, in the case of Bewdley school, the bodies that I have listed provided funds—were maintained and were not thwarted by any future action of the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's comments. Most of them concerned subsection (4C) of amendment No. 297, which deals with property held for the purposes of a school, part of which it is decided—or, eventually, determined—will not transfer. In cases where such property does transfer and becomes the property of a grant-maintained school, the rules governing the use of that property and the safeguards to be deployed really apply to the provisions of the previous subsection, (4B). As I understand my hon. Friend's point, we are now considering users of property that does not transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Wallsend said, some of that property may not be used mainly be the school, or there may be a plan for another use of the property. However, strictly speaking, it is used for the school at the time when the transfer is contemplated. That is a separate matter because the LEA would retain the premises if it were so agreed or ordered. Any use the authority made or chose to make of that property would be determined by the Education Acts anyway and by its own decisions. Nothing changes in that respect, although our general points about the need for dual use will continue to apply. For property that does not transfer under the clause, nothing substantially changes and the arrangements for obtaining dual use, or the underlying ownership of that property, are not affected by it. Having said that, it is desirable, if agreement is reached between the school and the LEA, that they consult others who may have an interest. The clause as drafted and the amendments do not materially affect the position of property that does not transfer in relation to use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the Government intend the amendments to improve existing legislation and to seek agreement between the various parties.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sought clarification of the matter and I am advised that not only can the agreement concluded between the grant-maintained school and the LEA embody provisions for dual use, but, in a sense it safeguards the position when the property is split. In other words, a deal can be done. I am advised, too, that the Secretary of State, in making an order, can also make
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
prescriptions for dual use for the property that did not transfer. The position is even better protected than my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) and I anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(d) any equipment owned by the local authority and held at the school for the use of a child with special educational needs'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would exclude from transfer any equipment owned by the local authority and held at the school for the use of a child with special educational needs. It is necessary so as to ensure that special equipment especially provided for a child's use at a school does not stay there, unused, when that child leaves the school. There are many examples which show how important it is for specialised equipment for children with special needs to remain in the ownership of the local authority and to be made available to grant-maintained schools for children who need such equipment.

I am concerned about special provision in mainstream schools. Other parts of the Bill deal specifically with the arrangements for special schools to become grant maintained. The amendment is not an attempt to wreck that process. If the Minister accepts the principle, the amendment could be redrafted to make it clear that it covers mainstream schools that have specialised equipment because, at the time of becoming grant maintained, they had children requiring special help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given some examples of the equipment needed by the visual impaired service and of the sort of money that the local authority might spend on a child to ensure that he has access to a proper education in a mainstream school. For hearing impaired children, Coopers and Lybrand specify radio hearing aids costing £650, speech trainers £455, a speech viewer £813, computer equipment at almost £1,000, video camera at almost £1,000 and so on.

A child with a hearing impairment may need thousands of pounds worth of equipment to ensure that he can be educated in a mainstream school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give further information because I am not familiar with that report? Are those items held at a school all the time or are they moved to various schools? Will he tell us a little more about the meaning of the word "help"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall tell the hon. Gentleman more about that because that is my next point. At present the local authority is responsible for ensuring that all children receive whatever help they need to undertake education. Some of them have statements, but they are often children who do not have statements but who are nevertheless receiving additional help to enable them to be educated in a mainstream school. Several thousands of pounds might be spent on a child who is statemented to provide equipment to ensure that he has an education in a mainstream school. When the child finishes at that school and continues his education elsewhere, the equipment may move with the child because it is LEA equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child might move from primary to secondary school, or from a middle school to a comprehensive school or from a school that ends when children reach the age of 16 onto a sixth college. Arrangements can be made for the equipment to move with the child and servicing of such equipment can be provided on an overall contract for all equipment in the LEA area. That helps to cut costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A situation might occur in which a child leaves a school and some equipment remains because it falls within the ownership of a grant-maintained school, although there may not be another child who needs it. Our amendment is an attempt to ensure that, when the local authority has provided special equipment to enable a child to continue with his education at that school, even if the school becomes grant-maintained, the equipment should not be the property of the school, but should remain within the LEA. The equipment could either move with the child to the next school, or return to the LEA store and be re-directed to the next child, at another school, who required it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will have read the letter that we received several days ago from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools, which referred to the provision of special education by the LEA to grant-maintained schools. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If schools' policies are to be effective the schools must be able to call on a range of support services if they wish, particularly the education psychology service and the experts providing advice, specialist teaching and guidance on specialist equipment for pupils with special needs. I therefore also propose to table an amendment which will put beyond doubt LEA's ability to provide those services to pupils with special educational needs in all grant-maintained schools." If that is the case, and I totally agree with it, the equipment should move with the LEA from school to school, as our amendment states. I assume that the Government would have no objection to the amendment because of the Minister's letter.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for raising that relevant point. It shows that the Government have already agreed that something must be done to ensure that specialised equipment will remain the responsibility of the LEA and will move to the school where it is needed. It also
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
indicates the important point that the maintenance contracts can be dealt with on an authority-wide basis to help save on costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's letter, I hope that, if the Government are not prepared to accept the wording of the amendment, they will say that they have already recognised the need to take account of that and will introduce their own amendment to ensure that specialised equipment remains with the local authority to be used by the children who need that help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equipment can sometimes be more expensive than the figures that I have quoted. My examples are of the sort of items that are regularly used for children with visual or hearing impairments. There was a case in my constituency in which children needed specific items of the value of between £40,000 and £50,000 to enable them to continue their education. When equipment is provided for a child, it is important that it can be moved to another school to which the child may go or can be made available for another child who needs it, but who goes to a different school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop my argument because I hope that it is clear to the Committee and the Minister's letter demonstrated that the Government well recognise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary by clearing away the brushwood. The hon. Gentleman did not deploy this argument, but this is not a statement or non-statement related issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equipment may be specific to a child whether or not that child has a statement. Equally, equipment may be used by a number of children, not all of whom have a statement or they may use it together. That might be material to particular cases, but they are determined on a different basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the amendment and my advice on the state of the law and current practice is that the test is whether the equipment is specific to the child. Only LEA property used or held for the purposes of the school transfers to the grant-maintained school. If the property is held at a school for the purposes of a named individual, it is probable that it will be decided that that property is not held or used for the purposes of the school. If the equipment is used by a number of children in the school and it is held in the school, it may be decided that the property is used for the purposes of the school. A number of children may need the equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If something is provided by the LEA for a named individual who happens to be at the school and, as the hon. Member for Bridgend rightly said, that child takes the equipment with him or it is transferable to another child with a similar disability in another school, the equipment is not held for the purposes of the school and it is unlikely to transfer to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To depart from consideration of special educational needs, a similar analogy can be drawn in respect of musical instruments. The instruments may be in a school for class music and used by many children. They are part of the property of or are held for the purposes of the school. However, an especially gifted child may be provided with a musical instrument. Even though the instrument is not the child's personal property, it does not form part of the school's property and would not transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised the interesting issue of musical equipment. At this very moment, a dispute
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
is taking place between a grant-maintained school and a local authority about an expensive bassoon. The Education Assets Board has made a ruling, which in principle suppports the local authority, but there is still an argument. There is a need to hone the provisions on equipment to take account of problems such as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I shall not comment on that specific case until it is agreed or resolved. I have a daughter who is a bassoonist and I confirm the substantial expense involved. The hon. Gentleman has made the point for me that there is machinery for resolving disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic test, which we believe to be available already, is whether the equipment or property is available for the use of a specific child. If it is, it is not part of what I might, in shorthand, call school furniture, or the school's inheritance, and it does not transfer. The outcome would depend on the facts of the individual case. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect upon what I have said and feel able to withdraw the amendment, which is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfied, partly because of the on-going dispute over that bassoon—which is a very expensive instrument, as confirmed by the Minister from his own experience. However, I take the point—indeed, I made it myself—that where the statement provides for a child to have equipment, that can go with the child to another school or, if the child no longer uses it, to the local authority to be used for another child in the LEA area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister to check whether it is possible—because I believe that it is—for the local authority to keep specialised equipment at a school for children who may not have statements, but who would never the less benefit from it. There could be an argument about whether the equipment is for the school or for the children who happen to be there then, so that it can be used, if the local authority wishes, with children elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing practice has not properly resolved such issues and I am still not convinced that existing legislation would cover the point. I am prepared to withdraw the amendment so that we may all have second thoughts on the matter and either receive some assurance from the Minister about the future working of the law or bring forward a more specific and agreeable amendment to cover the points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has reasonably enough pointed out that grey areas exist in this as in other aspects of property transfer. It is impossible and would, indeed, be undesirable for this Committee or the Bill to make precise prescriptions for what may be widely varying circumstances. My general view is that the Education Assets Board has already built up a degree of custom and practice in these cases. I shall certainly reflect upon what he has said. If we feel that any action is appropriate we can then perhaps return to the matter, although at the moment I see no particular reason to do so in the light of the assurances that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has agreed to consider the matter again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 519, in page 16, line 11, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Any liability of a local authority excluded by virtue of subsection 3(b) and 3(c) above from transfer to the governing body shall on the date of the implementation of the proposals be transferred to the funding authority.'</p></blockquote>
The Minister admitted a few moments ago that there were several grey areas in respect of property transfer. In one aspect there is no grey area. My understanding of the Education Reform Act 1988 and of clause 30 of the Bill, is, broadly—and this is perhaps an oversimplification—that when a school takes on grant-maintained status, its property and assets are transferred to the governing body of the new grant-maintained school. However, many of the liabilities relating to the property and assets are not transferred with them. In other words, there is effectively a hidden subsidy to the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their health service reforms, the Government made clear that when a directly-managed unit—usually a hospital, but also other health units—opts out and becomes an NHS trust, it takes with it the property and assets together with the liabilities relating to them. The Government argue that that is an efficient and effective method of organisation because it ensures that the unit—or trust—takes account of liabilities when making decisions in future about its assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have never reached the stage in educational circles—not even under this Government—at which individual schools must take on the liabilities, such as the debt charges, of their properties. It remains for the local education authority of each region to ensure that decisions on future educational provision take into account those liabilities. I am sure that the Minister is keen on that, particularly in relation to attempts to reduce the number of school places. He has often cited the considerable sums that could be saved if surplus places were removed and if the money from assets no longer required were realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
Therefore, it is strange that in the transfer of assets from the local education authority sector into the grant-maintained schools sector, there is a transfer of property from one sector to another, without the corresponding transfer of liabilities. That means that when considering its important responsibility for admissions to schools and removal of surplus places, the grant-maintained schools sector does not need to take into account the liabilities, such as the debt charges, on premises in the sector. My relatively simple amendment would introduce the principle that the liabilities, as well as the property assets, be transferred to the grant-maintained schools sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 30(3)(b) and (c) makes clear that those liabilities are excluded from transfer. My amendment suggests that they should not be excluded from transfer. However, rather than transferring them to individual grant-maintained schools, which would create much difficulty, they would be transferred to the funding authorities which are responsible not just for individual schools, but for the grant-maintained schools sector as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. If not, I hope that he can assure me that this is not a further hidden subsidy for the grant-maintained sector and that the liabilities relating to property and assets will be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered the effect of subsection 3(c), which applies to a local authority's liability for a former employee's past period of service? It has nothing to do with the funding agency or the grant-maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could apply to property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not understand my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3)(c) refers to compensation for past service. The provision contains no continuing benefit for grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to recognise that many changes occur in the efficient organisation of schools. They include changes in the number of staff. The staff constitute a continuing benefit to a grant-maintained school. I hope that the broad principle of transferring the liabilities as well as the assets is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the amendment. It expresses an important principle and it would have real and practical effects on local authorities' power to manage any debts that they have accrued. The amendment would help to reflect the real costs of a grant-maintained school. Capital expenditure is currently made on individual schools in the way that the Government dictate: money is borrowed on the market, debt charges accrue, and local authorities have to pay for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most local authorities pool capital charges centrally. Any system should, therefore, reflect the difficulty of attributing specific capital expenditure to individual schools. Charges could be calculated on that basis if there is a will to do that. However, such a system would be labour intensive and not the best use of public resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have developed a method to tackle capital charges by the allocation of resources to local authorities. The method is carried out through the standard spending assessment system, which includes a notional element for capital charges. Every local authority receives that element to cover what the Government consider to be a reasonable calculation of the charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charges have revenue implications and revenue is tackled by standard spending assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has merit because it could provide for an element of capital that has been given notionally to a local authority to be transferred to the funding council to reflect the charges accrued by grant-maintained schools. That is a fairly simple exercise. It could be achieved without always reflecting the specific costs of individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may ask why we should bother to go through that exercise. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, it is worth doing, to reflect accurately the real costs of the grant-maintained sector. Costs are incurred through building and improvements to schools. An element of the funding council's budget should reflect the debt charges of grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
