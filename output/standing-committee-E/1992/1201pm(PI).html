</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned, I had made my preamble to the amendment, which would tackle the issue of the efficient provision of education in response to parental choice. The difficulty is to reconcile the Government's objective of extending parental choice with the removal of surplus places. The aim of the amendments is to reveal the problems that will arise as a result of that stated objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult to achieve the efficient delivery of an education service when the Bill would require the local education authority and the funding agency to have dual or parallel responsibility during the time when between 10 and 75 per cent, of pupils are in grant-maintained schools. That will result in the inefficient provision of an education service because it will be difficult for either the LEA or the funding agency to take the lead either in removing certain surplus places or in extending parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister said this morning made matters more confused, but the amendments make it clear what should be the objectives in the provision of education and parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to the removal of the 1·5 million surplus places that they identified. That objective will be difficult to achieve and it will considerably
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
reduce parental choice. The desire to extend parental choice and the recognition of the fact that there must be some reduction in the surplus capacity in schools are laudable objectives, but the dead hand of the Treasury is involved in the aim to remove such a large number of school places. If so many places are taken out of the school system, parental choice will be greatly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant-maintained sector has expanded in only a handful of LEAs. It has caused difficulties in respect of admissions to individual schools and dissatisfaction among parents. Members of the Committee will be aware of the problems created in Hillingdon, Ealing and Kent by trying to give parents the schools of their choice. The expansion of the grant-maintained sector has not increased parental choice in those authorities: indeed, in many cases that choice has been denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If surplus places are removed on the scale proposed by the Government, parents will be struggling over a limited number of places. Schools will choose the pupils rather than parents choose the schools. Some local authorities have taken the initiative to remove surplus places. A survey carried out by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities 12 months ago found that there had been a drop in successful primary school choices from 91 per cent, to 79 per cent, in one year in a west midlands local education authority, and a local education authority in Tyne and Wear had seen a decline from 83 per cent, to 63 per cent, in successful first choices over three years specifically because of the removal of surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paradox created by the Bill is that the removal of surplus places will deny parental choice. Small rural schools will face difficulties because of the Government's commitment to remove a large number of surplus places. Many authorities have done that already; they are often Conservative-controlled LEAs that wish to placate their masters in Central Office. Those small rural schools will be threatened with closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Marsham county primary school in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Ryder), the Chief Whip, is a typical Victorian primary school. It is built around two classrooms and according to the Government and the LEA has a capacity of 64 pupils. At present 30 pupils attend the school; it is only half full. From a bureaucrat's view, a large number of surplus places should be removed, because those 30 pupils are taught in classes of 15 or 16. The school has the full support of parents; 18 sets of parents choose to send their children to it. But that does not matter to the Government or to Norfolk education authority because that school is to be closed as part of the exercise to remove surplus school places. The education committee voted for closure by just two votes, but that decision has now been referred to the full county council meeting in January for further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a good example of the difficulties that occur when the desire to remove surplus places is the overriding consideration. That small village primary school has the strong support of the local community and parents, but parental choice is being denied because of the removal of surplus places. The Bill would provide for both parental choice and the removal of surplus places, but we believe that that is an impossible objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the grant-maintained sector could develop and expand with no parental support. It might even be expanded in the face of opposition from parents. The Government have always prided themselves on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
fact that the grant-maintained sector is built on parental choice. They argue that parents voting for schools to become grant maintained is a strong demonstration of the democratic process. Ministers point out proudly that the turn out in ballots for grant-maintained status is often higher than for local authority elections. The Bill allows the funding agency to expand the grant-maintained sector with no reference to the views of parents generally or those who have sponsored the establishment of a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money will be the key to the development of the grant-maintained sector. Last week we discussed the revenue that the Government would provide. The Under-Secretary of State for Schools said that the link between the amount of revenue that a grant-maintained school receives and an LEA's expenditure on education was important, reflecting, as it did, the amount that grant-maintained schools currently receive. He said that that may change, that the link may be broken if the number of grant-maintained schools increases. However, we must await the promised consultation document on revenue, which should come to us around Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the Government's plans for the capital regime because the autumn statement made it clear how it will operate for the maintained and the grant-maintained sectors. The autumn statement revealed that, over a three-year period, a little more than 20 per cent, of the total capital for schools would go to the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That begs the question of what the funding authorities intend, given that they will have access to large capital sums from the Government. They will also have powers under clause 40 to establish afresh grant-maintained schools and under clause 86, to decide on "a significant enlargement" to a grant-maintained school—all that can be done without the obligation either to consult parents or re-ballot them on whether they want the number of pupils at a school to be doubled. All that is offered is some woolly wording about consultation taking place. If it is anything like the consultation that took place on the White Paper, it will not be worth much to parents. We shall discuss the issue of shared responsibility, which causes great difficulty, on later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives powers to the funding agency and the finance will be provided to it through the capital regime. The Bill allows for the possibility of the grant-maintained sector expanding, not because of parental choice or rights, but because the funding agency will decide, for whatever reason, that new GM schools need to be set up or that existing schools need to be enlarged. There could be circumstances in which the funding agency would decide that a grant-maintained school that currently offered comprehensive education should offer a specialism. The agency would then fund a specialist block in that school. There could be circumstances in which the agency might decide to set up a new school and propose that the Secretary of State remove surplus places in the same LEA area. All those powers have been given to the funding agency. We are worried that the Bill will not require that the exercise of those significant powers be dealt with efficiently or in a way that takes into account or respects
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
parental choice. That is why we have tabled the amendments in this group, and I recommend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers). I hope that he will forgive me for suggesting that I heard a confusing message. I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for that, as people who are examining the closure of schools and the possibility of grant-maintained status are faced with a confusing option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman appeared to say that parents sometimes were voting with their feet and putting schools at risk of closure, with the consequent restriction of choice. However, he also referred to a school in Norfolk which had the support of parents but which might be closed by the county LEA. He said that the GM option might save the school and thus protect choice but that it would perpetuate the problem of excess places. I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman, as I think he has spelt out the reality of a number of the system's imponderables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parents do not want to go down the grant-maintained route. They want to keep the school that they have. That option will be denied to them because of the commitment to the removal of surplus places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. It is good to see you, Mr. Pawsey, in the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just welcoming Mr. Pawsey to the Chair, but I am sure that my hon. Friend wishes to support me in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene just when he was about to welcome you, Mr. Pawsey, to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I should like to do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school that has just been mentioned is only a few miles outside my constituency. However, the hon. Member for Wallsend may not realise that there are other schools only a few miles away from it which lack sufficient space and which are oversubscribed by parents and young people. The difficulty for the Government and the local authority lies in trying to be fair to those schools that are in demand. Unless surplus places are removed, the resources cannot be provided to satisfy the young people and parents who want to go to other schools in the area. Matters are not as simple as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is entirely right and has underlined my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to efficiency and parental choice, but they are often incompatible. One cannot have both in full measure, so a compromise must be reached. That is so whether the school is wholly maintained or whether the grant-maintained option is under review. The amendment would provide that, where closure is in the best interests of the community, there should be no escape simply through going grant-maintained. However, that is not the only issue: the quality of the school and the parental support, as shown through the ballot for grant-maintained status,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
are equally important. That is why it is crucial that the Secretary of State ultimately decides, having received all information concerning the availability of places, about the quality of the school and the parental support. He can make a judgment based on all three factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that I heard him correctly? Does he accept that the concept of reducing the number of available places—of taking surplus places out of the system—reduces parental choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point is that there are various elements to be decided by the LEA or the funding authority. For example, there could be more resources for other schools by taking some surplus places out of the system and parents could choose a particular school and show that they are prepared to support it. There are incompatibles in the system, which is why the Secretary of State must ultimately adjudicate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs Campbell) has entirely missed my earlier point, which was specifically addressed to my constituency, to the schools near my constituency and to the other school to which I referred—I understand the difficulties of the parents of the school in Marsham. In my constituency, parents are being denied choice—a point that has not got through to Opposition Members—because there are no available places. Only by reducing surplus places can places be made available in other schools—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, I see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is common sense and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) will support my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss the way in which vacant space is assessed—a point that I raised on Second Reading and to which I hope the Minister will respond. I am concerned about the way in which the assessment of empty spaces —in locally-maintained LEA schools and the funding authority—has not accounted for the provision of nursery education or for the use of some rooms for expensive resources. The more we have computers and other expensive equipment in schools, the more it is necessary to provide a secure room. If somebody looks at the square footage only, he can say, "Well, that is a room that could take more pupils. Therefore, the school should take more pupils." It is important to remember that certain rooms in a school are also used for other educational purposes, such as teacher centres. That point is not specific to the amendment, but the amendment gives me the opportunity to raise the issue. We need to ensure that we consider genuinely empty places. We will then get the balance that the amendment seeks to produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend has spelt out clearly the difficulties that the clause encapsulates about parental choice and surplus places. The clause and schedule 2 are the heart of the Bill. The clause aims to give the funding agency new functions in planning the provision of school places—that has been the responsibility of the LEAs since the Education Act 1944. We all realise the importance of the clause and of getting it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause embodies the main thrust of the Bill, which will change the role of LEAs and their democratic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
accountability. The role will be passed over—I hope in a phased and sensible way—to the funding agency, which is responsible only to the Secretary of State. As a result, the clause will reduce democratic accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause raises many issues which relate to the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first concentrate on the still unclear—despite what the Minister said this morning—roles and shared responsibilities of the local education authority and the funding agency. Their responsibilities are ill-defined. Comments from schools and local education authorities during the consultation process reveal a great deal of anxiety about that. It has been described as a recipe for chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe an on-going case in Cambridgeshire —not in my constituency but in the local authority in which my constituency lies—which demonstrates how shared power and responsibility for providing sufficient school places does, or could, lead to a bureaucratic nightmare and the duplication of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cambridgeshire LEA—I think in its response to the White Paper—pointed out that such reorganisation could involve six different organisations: the local education authority; the funding agency for schools; the Further Education Funding Council in cases involving the provision of sixth-form places; the relevant diocesan authority, if church schools are involved; the Department for Education or the Secretary of State; and perhaps the local sector. The reorganisation proposals spanning secondary and primary schools could lead to one sector being controlled by the funding agency for schools and one by the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Cambridgeshire 11 to 16-year-old schools would like their own sixth forms. For example, Queens school in Wisbech is an 11 to 16-year-old school and wishes to start its own sixth form. However, there is already adequate provision in the area. Neale Wade college in March has a large sixth form and the Isle college in Wisbech, a local further education college, offers A-level courses, BTEC and other vocational courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many agencies are already involved in that example. However, the grant-maintained school wishes to provide sixth-form places when there is already provision in the area. In that situation accountability or responsibility is extremely unclear. A funding agency, which is responsible for grant-maintained schools, would probably like to give Queens school a sixth form, but the local education authority will wish to retain the sixth forms in Neale Wade college and Isle college. That sort of dispute will also involve the Further Education Funding Council. It is not a case of one side against the other, but of a mad scramble among many agencies in which the Secretary of State would find himself as referee trying to blow the whistle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question as to whether the grant-maintained school would be allowed to duplicate provision would remain. Who would decide? Would it be the governors of the school? Would it be the funding agency? Would it be the local education authority? Would it be the Further Education Funding Council? The involvement of those agencies would lead to an extremely inefficient use of money in educational provision and during the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already know from the example cited by the hon. Member for Battersea that parental choice is increased in some areas by closing schools while choice to other parents is denied. Will choice be increased for parents with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
children in the grant-maintained sector, but denied to parents with children in LEA schools? That must be clarified. Although the Minister says that he has no specific targets for grant-maintained status, the Government speak of the schools succumbing to grant-maintained status and I suspect that temptation may be put in their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sharing of responsibility for planning provision could lead to disaster and to passing the buck, while children and their parents suffer. When a great deal of controversial decisions must be made and no one is sure where responsibility lies, a long-drawn-out process could result, with parents, teachers and children becoming increasingly disillusioned and demoralised by the uncertainty. There is no chance of the proposal working unless roles and duties are clearly identified and set up in a spirit of co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the crux of the matter. The wording of the Bill does not allow for co-operation. The funding agency is intended to take over the role of the local education authorities in both the planning and the provision of school places. That is bound to lead to confrontation and a difficult situation in which schools, parents and pupils will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tone of the White Paper and the Minister's statement to the House make it clear that the Government want all schools to become grant maintained. Will that increase choice? Are parents being given a real choice to opt out of what the Government describe as LEA control, when there are such huge financial incentives to do so? That is not a choice; it is a bribe. We should be clear about that. Let us not speak about choice. It is not choice—it is bribery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady care to comment on the point that she is making now, compared with the point that she made earlier, when she fairly and accurately pointed out that in the ballots to date, the ratio of those in favour of grant-maintained status to those against is about 3:1? If one in four ballots turns out to be no, the bribe or the overwhelming pressure to which she refers does not seem to have worked as successfully as she might imagine. Either there is free choice, and some ballots say yes and some say no, or there is not, in which case her point might have some validity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been a great pleasure to me and, I believe, to many LEAs and parents that despite the bribes, parents have seen the value of belonging to a local education authority. Despite the overwhelming financial advantage offered to schools facing that difficult choice, the ballot results are remarkable—21 per cent, of schools rejected the choice of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local accountability and expertise in planning provision are an important part of what LEAs have to offer. The funding agencies are unlikely to have expertise and local knowledge. They will seem remote to parents and they will not be locally accountable. I wonder whether they will have the time and expertise to deal with parents on new building issues, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drawing on my own experience, it may be helpful for me to describe briefly for the Minister's benefit an issue that arose recently at the school that all my children
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
attended, a secondary school in the centre of Cambridge. The school was built in the early part of the century. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> For hon. Members' information, I have three children, who all attended the same secondary school in Cambridge. It is an excellent school, offering a marvellous standard of education and achieving very good examination results, but its buildings were crumbling and it was increasingly difficult to repair and maintain it. The local authority's initial proposal was to build a new school on the edge of the city. That was subject to expensive consultation and, after several public meetings and representations from parents and governors, the overwhelming response of the community was that parents did not want that, they wanted their existing buildings remodelled. It took time to persuade the local authority that that was the genuine wish of the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that funding agencies will not have the local knowledge, the time or the patience to cope with several months of consultation. Will the Bill give power to parents? Will parents who vote for grant-maintained status be opting in to anything better than management by remote people in central Government? The Bill is another experiment with education with no pilot and no evaluation. The example that I gave, in which the LEA proved to be responsive to the local parents, is a good example of how local authorities, at their best, are working and of how funding agencies—I am confident—will not work. It is true that some LEAs could do better and my hon. Friends and I always press for improved efficiency. But this recipe for muddle will not solve the problems of poorly operating LEAs. The Minister is in danger of throwing away a good deal of good practice, expertise and efficiency. How could an individual governing body reporting to a remote funding agency foster the inter-school co-operation provided by a good LEA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady seems to be suggesting that, if an authority is remote, a grant-maintained school would suffer. Under the present arrangements, there is no funding agency as described in the Bill. Funds come straight from central Government, which is in many ways more remote than would be such an agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to a teacher in a grant-maintained school in Norfolk this weekend, who said that the atmosphere of freedom in the school and its operation was like a breath of fresh air and that the school was absolutely delighted with the new arrangements. That school operates under an even more remote funding arrangement that the Bill proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my experience. I notice that the hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Thompson) avoided mentioning the name of the school, but perhaps he will do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The massive changes of the past few years, that all pupils, teachers and parents have experienced—the introduction of the GCSE, local management of schools, the national curriculum, changes in religious education, the Education Acts, testing and assessment—could not have been possible without the help and co-operation of LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities such as Cambridgshire have a longstanding proven track record in removing surplus places and dealing with demand for growth involving grant-maintained and prospective grant-maintained schools. The LEA should have a permanent role in strategic

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
planning and the situation should not become muddied by that responsibility being shared with a remote funding agency with no local accountability. It must be clear which authority has the ultimate responsibility. On offer is the nightmare scenario of a free-for-all, with the Secretary of State as referee, which could not be sensible, practicable or workable. I hope that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would ensure the continuity of service during the transition from LEA to funding agency provision for grant-maintained schools. It would ensure that the provision was sufficient and responded sensitively to parental needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the relationship between LEAs and funding authorities will be good. Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) said that a good relationship was in the interests of the children. However, the remarks of Conservative Members about LEAs do not offer much hope for a good relationship between LEAs and funding authorities. Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge referred to the LEA in Cambridge. She said that it was Conservative-controlled, to which Conservative Members shouted, "Hear, hear". Yet the Government intend to destroy that Conservative-controlled body. Last week, a Conservative Member said that schools were in the "grasp" of LEAs. That hardly describes a loving embrace. Another Conservative Member claimed that schools were in the "stranglehold" of LEAs. "Town hall-controlled" is the other pejorative term that is used repeatedly. Today, the Minister said that he would get rid of LEA "monopoly power". None of those statements express good will. They do not augur well for a good relationship between LEAs and funding authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite Conservative Members' comments, I hope that there will be co-operation and partnership—the Minister used those words this morning—between the funding agency and the LEAs. That is vital for the efficiency of the service and for providing places in the future. The Secretary of State said that the organisations would run in parallel. In a previous incarnation, I was a teacher of mathematics. Youngsters used to ask me to define "parallel". "Parallel" means running side by side, but without meeting. Objects that run in parallel never meet. Their paths never cross; they remain the same distance apart. That is what the Secretary of State meant. He did not mention co-operation and partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's remarks this morning contradict what he said about the clause that covered the exchange of information?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another vision now that the local authority budgets have been announced. I can see the Secretary of State after the Bill is enacted, appointing the chairman of the funding agency and the other 10 to 15 members. I can see the Government setting up the new headquarters in Darlington—they have not denied that yet—and lorry loads of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Erith and Crayford intervened not in my speech, but in the speech that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) has not yet made and it is all the more interesting for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be serious difficulties when people in the local authorities see money used to provide education in local schools given to the funding agency and its accompanying bureaucracy. That will be a source of problems which will prevent the two bodies working efficiently together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that the funding agency and the local education authority were strategic planners in the provision of education in local schools. At present, when changes are needed in local education authority areas, plans are published which are then the subject of public consultation with parents and others in the local community, under procedures laid down in law. A plan is devised and developed with the co-operation of the local community, to meet its needs efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process proposed will be carried out not just by the LEAs. There will be many more players, including the funding agencies. When the funding agency plans major changes such as closing or opening schools or altering their nature, does the Minister expect the funding agency to go through the same processes of consultation with parents as the LEAs do now? Would a voluntary body, the promoter of a grant-maintained school, have to consult parents and listen to the views of the LEA and the funding agency on the efficient delivery of the service? I hope that the Minister will answer my questions when he responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have experience of such changes and I know how organisations work. When the Devon authority took on the job or reorganising schools in Plymouth, it closed a large number of school, but substantially improved the choice for parents in that area by providing sufficient finance and resources to the remaining schools to make them much better. That was a complicated and convoluted process. It involved talking to local people and groups of parents, holding many public meetings and discussing with the local education authority the need for efficiencies and for taking parental need into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That process was not without some agony. There will be substantial difficulties if the amendment is rejected.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
Other bodies, such as the funding agency, and the promoters of schools could be involved in the process, alongside organisations such as the Church, which rightly has been involved in the past. There is great scope for inaction and for the bodies to palm off the decisions so that nothing happens. The amendment would enshrine in law that the reorganisation involved in the closure or opening of a school should proceed efficiently and with due account taken of the needs and wishes of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cambridge was right when she said that clause 7 was at the heart of the Bill. It is the vital cog in the machinery being proposed by the Secretary of State, and the latest dogmatic and damaging attack on local government. I was puzzled that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) was surprised by the Government's attack, through the Bill, on local education authorities. All Opposition Members know that, since 1979, Conservative Members have mounted a concerted attack on local government and have chipped away at its security, power and responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devonport will recall that the Government have often concluded that they should scrap what they cannot control—the metropolitan counties, the Greater London council and the Inner London education authority are examples of that. When the Government do not resort to scrapping a body, they try to erode and take over its powers. Clause 7 deals with the removal of powers from the local education authorities and the donation of powers to new bodies. Opposition Members must try to work out from the Minister's responses just how the two organisations will work together. The image that comes to mind is of two pigs with their snouts in a trough, with both animals out to get as much as they can rather than working together for the benefit of their community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 156 and 158 are concerned with gaining clarification about the way in which the process will work. All the amendments tabled to clause 7 are about clarifying the powers of the two bodies, or about the way in which those bodies will work together. We are all confused. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Battersea was not surprised at the confusion of the hon. Member for Wallsend; he accepted that the position is confusing. We desperately need clarification, which the Minister failed to give us this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people outside the Committee are equally confused. The Tory-run London Boroughs Association said that this dual operation is
	<br><q><p>"a recipe for confusion, duplication of effort and lack of clarity in the public mind about who is responsible."</p></q>
North Yorkshire county council—where the chairs of all committees are held by Conservatives—says:
	<br><q><p>"To establish the FAS alongside an existing LEA is a sure recipe for increased confusion and duplication of effort."</p></q>
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that it was
	<br><q><p>"A bureaucratic nightmare where the complexity and possibility for duplication in the current proposals could lead to fragmentation and dispute, leaving an atmosphere of suspicion whenever the final point was reached."</p></q>
Those comments illustrate the confusion of many outside bodies and of many hon. Members—on both sides of the Committee in view of the remarks of the hon. Member for Battersea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
There is an urgent need for the Minister to clarify the commonality of functions of the two bodies. Amendments Nos. 156 and 158 do not deal with the methodology and the way in which those two bodies will work together. Under the Bill, the funding authority could establish a new grant-maintained school in an area where there is already a surfeit of places in LEA schools. That is worrying. The Minister said that he wants the two bodies to work together for the benefit of the whole community. We still want to know how that will be possible. The amendments would ensure that both bodies have the same duties by giving funding authorities responsibility for the closure of surplus places where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that that plea will be supported by the hon. Member for Battersea. He said that there should be no escape from closure—whether or not it is a grant-maintained school—if that were in the best interests of the area as a whole. He accepts that the funding authorities and the LEAs should have a duty to close schools if that is in the interests of the whole community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I actually said was that that was the aim of the amendment. I pointed out that whether there are surplus places in the area as a whole is one element. A school may be designated for closure because it does not have a full quota of pupils. That school should not necessarily escape closure; the quality of education at that school and the support of parents in the community make up the other part of the equation that the Secretary of State must take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no disagreement between us. Amendments Nos. 156 and 158 would ensure that the duties of the two bodies are the same. We need to have a separate discussion about the way in which those identical duties should be exercised in the interests of the area because there is confusion about that. I hope that the hon. Member for Battersea will support amendments Nos. 156 and 158. If we are to clarify how the two organisations will work, we must consider their identical or similar duties and the way in which they will co-operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 156 and 158 are especially important. Within the structure set out in the Bill, local education authorities and funding authorities have a vested interest in ensuring that their surplus places do not leave the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fewer surplus places in the grant-maintained sector could bring the number of children in grant-maintained schools below the 10 per cent. mark. More places in LEA schools could also lead to that. The Government have not made clear what would happen in those circumstances and that adds to the power of the argument of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) that both bodies should have equal powers. That should be laid down in law. It is not in the interests of the LEA or the funding authority for one to give way to the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. She adds force to the arguments for the amendments. Earlier, we discussed the two pigs' snouts in the trough, both out to maximise benefits for themselves. We should ensure that LEAs and funding authorities have identical powers and work in the same direction, so that the best interests of an area are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
served. The argument is clear and I look forward to the Minister's response. I hope that he will use it to explain the difficulties about the operation of the two bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members believe that shared responsibility, which has become known as phase 2, is fraught with problems. Under the Bill, there would be two sets of civil servants: one to work for the funding agency and another to work for the LEA. The current system works and has been seen to work since the second world war. The least we can expect from the Secretary of State is that, before making an order under clause 7, he should be satisfied that the system is not working, and that a local education authority is failing in its duty to provide places efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not convinced that clause 7 is workable. The Government have not thought through its implications. It is interesting that its provision is known as a phasing arrangement. Phase 2 describes shared responsibility between the LEA and the funding agency. Implicit in that is the assumption that we shall reach phase 3, when responsibility will no longer be shared; that when we go beyond the 75 per cent, threshold, the funding agency will take over the LEAs' function in providing school places. Bearing in mind that the percentage of schools that opt out is lower than 2 per cent, in England and Wales, that is optimistic, to say the least. At the current rate of progress, there could be a shared arrangement for as long as the 1944 Act's provisions for schools places have been with us. Phase 2 could last for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 does not specify who will take the lead in ensuring that there are sufficient places in an area. Unless that is specified in the Bill, no matter what assurances the Minister gives, there is a danger that the amount of work will double because of increasing bureaucracy. Ministers have told us many times that they think that local authorities are bureaucratic. Goodness knows what will happen when we couple their bureaucracy with that of a distant, unelected quango to share responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If no one body has the lead responsibility for provision of places, we can imagine the sort of buck-passing between LEAs and the funding agency that will result. Parents and children will be caught in the middle. We suspect that the Government's unspoken wish in not stating who should have lead responsibility is that the confusion will lead to LEAs handing over their rights and responsibilities to the funding agency before the 75 per cent, threshold is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if there is a dispute between the funding agency and the LEA over provision of places? I expect that the Minister will assure us that the matter can be referred to the Secretary of State—as usual, a case of "Whitehall man knows best." The truth is that only the LEA—not only its elected members, but its staff—will have sufficient local knowledge to make decisions that take account of a community's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One advantage of an elected authority is that accountability is part of the decision-making process that reflects local needs. I fear that the Government intend to create chaos in the system so that LEAs will be frustrated in their endeavours to provide sufficient school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the powers are to be shared, no member of the Government has explained how two independent organisations—local government and the funding agency —can share this type of responsibility. There is certainly no explanation in the Bill or in the notes on clauses. Most
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
people would accept that properly-functioning education authorities such as mine, in Lancashire, leave the efficient provision of places in schools to one organisation rather than two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the Minister say this morning, in reply to a question from the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) about whether there were precedents, that he could think of none. Neither can I. The Minister may have had time since then to look up interesting and successful precedents for an unelected quango sharing responsibilities with an elected organisation where bureaucracy was reduced rather than increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to reduce the number of surplus places. However, they are essential if parental choice is to have any meaning—a point made this morning by the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon). In my constituency so-called parental choice has been a cruel con. Effectively, parents can exercise no choice whatever over their children's school. A first choice school may be full to overflowing, and there is a limit to the physical, as well as the educational, capacity that a school can sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the summer, my surgeries were full of parents telling me that they had Government leaflets stating that they had the right to send their child to the school of their choice, but that they could not exercise that right because the school was full. In the end, they were directed to a school that had surplus places or, as some Conservative members of the Committee might call it, a failing school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will such a disaster for parents be remedied by the imposition of an unelected quango such as the funding agency? It will not. Before such an unelected level of bureaucracy is imposed on any area, there should be in the Bill a duty on the Secretary of State to demonstrate to his satisfaction and to the satisfaction of Parliament that the LEA is failing in its responsibilities. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak particularly to amendments Nos. 132 and 133. Under the 1944 Act, local authorities have a duty to provide sufficient schools—
	<br><q><p>"sufficient in number, character, and equipment"—</p></q>
so that all pupils are afforded opportunities according to
	<br><q><p>"their different ages, abilities, and aptitudes".</p></q>
Schools also have a duty to secure special education provision for children who need it. We shall discuss that further in the context of later amendments. Section 8 of the 1944 Act provides not only for sufficient schools, but for schools that meet the pupils' education needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has a duty
	<br><q><p>"to promote … education … and to secure the effective execution … of the … policy for providing a varied and comprehensive educational service".</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend spoke in detail about those duties and responsibilities. Given that the creation of the funding authority makes nonsense of the Secretary of State's duty, when will the Government table amendments to deal with that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 7 of the 1944 Act, local authorities must
	<br><q><p>"contribute towards the spiritual, moral, mental, and physical development"</p></q>
of the children
	<br><q><p>"by securing that efficient education … shall be available to meet the needs of the population of their area."</p></q>
Again, we must ask when the Government will table amendments to give similar responsibility to the funding authorities.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
The arrangement that has served us well for the past 50 years is to be destroyed by the clause. That is not because the arrangement does not work—it has worked admirably for 50 years—but simply because the Government are headlong in favour of the opting-out process. Their solution is to transfer that duty to the funding agencies when 75 per cent, of children in an area are educated at grant-maintained schools. I shall not discuss the 10 per cent, issue because we saw this morning that it was meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) spoke about phase 2 of the process. That is clearly the language of civil servants. It is not mentioned in the Bill. How can it possibly be workable? What does "shared" mean? There is no definition to explain what it means in this context. I should like to know, on behalf of the residents of Lewisham, and my hon. Friends want to know on behalf of residents in their constituencies, how many new places in schools will be made available as a result of the creation of the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government intend that the LEAs and the funding agency are to share responsibility in phase 2, why are they not dealt with in the same formulation? The Minister cannot be surprised if we are led to believe that there are different formulations for the LEAs, and for the funding agency because the Secretary of State intends that the funding agency should have the lion's share of the responsibility. The formulation in the Bill is a smokescreen to provide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we heard that the Government assume that opting-out will speed up. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge admirably pointed out why that was an over-ambitious dream of theirs and that phase 2 is likely to be around for some years to come; so the arrangements that must be provided under that must last. Will the Minister be able to guarantee that the new arrangements can match the record of the 50 years since the 1944 Act?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to debate local accountability, the way in which the Bill and the clause are shaped and the reason for the amendments. It would be wrong if the Government were deliberately using the Bill to create vague arrangements, which will cause complete chaos in LEAs. They will be forced to hand over their responsibilities for providing places in local schools to the funding agency because they will be frustrated to the point of despair at their inability to respond to local needs. Is that the Government's intention? I will happily give way to the Minister if he is prepared to answer that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MRS. ANN WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The Minister is not prepared to respond. I take it, therefore, that he intends to force local education authorities to concede responsibility to the funding agency.</p>
	<p>The clause is another example of the Government experimenting with the country's children. Their previous experiments with the local management of schools and the introduction of grant-maintained status have not yet been evaluated. In London, there are 43 grant-maintained schools, only six of which are in Labour-controlled boroughs. Only 1·7 per cent, of London children are attending grant-maintained schools. Yet the Minister has said that the London boroughs of Brent, Barnet, Bromley, Croydon, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hillingdon, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Sutton and Wandsworth will be educating 10 per cent, of their secondary pupils in grant-maintained schools by April next year. How does the Minister think that that will happen in the short period between now and then? What will be the effect of the dual planning arrangements in the Bill on the children in those boroughs? The Minister did

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
not include my borough of Lewisham as one that will have children educated in grant-maintained schools by April 1993.</p>
	<p>One problem involved in opting out and grant-maintained status that affects parental choice is the reorganisation proposals within the borough which have, on several occasions, persuaded parents to ballot on opting out. That has created long-term havoc in the borough's planning arrangements. For example, the five grant-maintained schools in Ealing were influenced in their decision to opt out because the borough proposed to establish a tertiary college. The hon. Member for Battersea did not tell us that the debates in Wandsworth schools highlighted parental anxiety about the borough's move to re-establish selection. Some schools in Wandsworth considered opting out to avoid the reintroduction of two-tier education.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were various reasons for the schools in Wandsworth seeking grant-maintained status. A primary school in my constituency opted out and secondary schools elsewhere in the borough sought grant-maintained status because they thought that it was the best way forward. There is no proposal in Wandsworth for selection, unless the hon. Lady means selection of aptitude for particular courses. That is a very different type of selection—of which I would have thought the hon. Lady would approve—from that in the past, in which schools selected on ability. The hon. Lady should be aware of the difference between aptitude and ability. If she and her party do not understand it, they will fail to understand what is best for pupils in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fascinating. We now have a distinction between ability and aptitude. Perhaps when the hon. Gentleman rises to speak in the debate, he will spend some time defining that difference. I remind the hon. Gentleman and other Conservative Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I cannot speak twice in the debate, I am grateful to the hon. Lady for allowing me to say that the magnet concept, which Wandsworth is examining, means that it makes sense for a school that is a magnet for, for example, modern languages to see whether a child has an aptitude for that subject, irrespective of ability level. The result is that pupils of all ability who have the appropriate aptitude will go to that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting definition, but I do not think that it would be found in any dictionary. I taught in Wandsworth for a couple of years, so I have bitter experience of Wandsworth education authority. It was the borough in which head teachers passed a vote of no confidence in the director of education because of the borough's policies. We do not have to take many lessons from Wandsworth or from the hon. Gentleman about how to provide good education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the worst examples of how children's education suffered under grant-maintained status was the debacle over Stratford school. The education authority was attempting to do its duty to secure sufficient places, as the law required. It decided that Stratford school should be closed to comply with the Government's requirement that surplus places be reduced. The school voted to opt out to avoid closure. It appears to have been encouraged to do so by members of the Conservative party in both local and national Government. Newham's Members of Parliament, councillors and officers warned the Minister of State at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
time that it was nonsense to award grant-maintained status to a school that was facing closure as part of a reorganisation process. Civil servants also advised against opting out, and there was overwhelming opposition from the school's governors. Nor was there any real support in the local community, but still the Government gave the go-ahead. The Government's determination to push forward with grant-maintained schools has been evident since the concept was first introduced. It is evident in every clause in the Bill, but especially in clause 7. The local education authorities' responsibility to provide sufficient places and an efficient schooling system is to go by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The involvement of the funding agency in making decisions about school places will tend to reduce the efficiency of the use of financial resources for a particular area. It is in the interests of children, parents and the wider community to have an efficient, publicly funded service that does not waste resources in maintaining surplus places unjustifiably. However, there must be some marginal spare capacity to satisfy parental choice. Without that, schools admission policies would dictate where pupils are admitted. As we warned at the start of our deliberations, schools would choose pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for our concern about the way in which the funding agency will take over responsibility for surplus places is the inaccurate data that we have had from the Department of Education. As the funding agency is simply the Department at arm's length—one step removed, but basically the Department's presence in the community—we have every reason to be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I raised some examples of inaccurate data. In Lewisham, schools that no longer existed or that were oversubscribed were accused of having surplus places. The DFE data included schools that had already obtained grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot trust the Department's figures to ensure that the funding agency will be able accurately to reflect the needs of local communities. The very formula is riven with difficulties. Most education authorities would say that it does not represent the best way to ensure that the number of places in any school is accurately recorded. The Department suggests that the difference between school capacity and the January rolls represents a surplus to be dealt with. That does not take into account the fact that the number of pupils in many schools increases after January for several reasons, or that changes may be taking place in the local area. For all those reasons, we are doubtful about the funding agency taking responsibility for surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capacity of a school is determined by both its staffing and its building. Therefore, revenue as well as capital considerations must be taken into account. Given that the revenue consideration is largely determined by pupil numbers, the most pertinent planning consideration is the efficient deployment of capital. The Minister has already said that grant-maintained schools will get a disproportionately large share of available capital, so it would seem likely that an order under the clause would lead to the inefficient use of capital grants. Grant-maintained capital projects could be approved even when they were of a lower priority in educational terms than those of LEA schools, which would be refused. That would give the grant-maintained sector the opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
expand when it did not represent the most efficient or economic use of public resources, especially where there were surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What proportion of school places will be left empty to allow for the exercise of parental choice? Will that apply to school places overall, or separately to places in each type of school? Will the Minister consider the effect of capital expenditure on surplus places—whether that would disadvantage LEA schools compared to grant-maintained schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 includes the words
	<br><q><p>"in response to the exercise of parental choice".</p></q>
Parental choice is not exercised exclusively within a LEA area. That is especially true in London and other metropolitan areas, and will become increasingly true in non-metropolitan areas after reorganisation. We can therefore expect similar cross-boundary flows of pupils outside London to those that we experience within London. That causes particular difficulty for the efficient running and strategic planning of LEAs now, and will cause even more for the funding agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will funding agencies approach the practical everyday difficulties of recoupment of fees? Will the Secretary of State oblige the funding agencies to conform to best practice in recoupment—for example, by including a 90 per cent, payment on account? Will the Secretary of State use interim payment arrangements, with a final payment at the end of the year based on the previous year's pupils' rolls at the current year's recoupment rates? Will he ensure a cut-off date for the settlement of claims and even penalties for failure to meet that date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those questions must be answered for the clause to make sense, because it makes no sense as it stands. It exists solely to undermine LEAs and to enhance the capacity of grant-maintained schools in the short and long-term. It will ensure that there is no local accountability, no LEA input in schooling, and no parental choice. Amendments Nos. 132 and 133 are, therefore, crucial. I hope that the Committee will support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You use your words, Minister, and I shall use mine. You are our third Chair today, Mrs. Winterton, and the fourth Chair of our proceedings. I am especially delighted to welcome you, because you also represent Cheshire in Parliament—your constituency is Congleton and mine is Warrington, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have missed most of the debate about clause 7, Mrs. Winterton. I shall not repeat the democratic arguments. We have failed to convince the Government that the erosion of democracy in the provision of education is a major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to convince the Minister of the economic argument for accepting our amendments. The creation of the funding agency for schools to run parallel to but not to share responsibility with LEAs to provide sufficient school places, is a recipe for confusion, duplication and bureaucracy. The amendments would deal with those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 would include in the Bill a provision that has been a feature of education legislation since the Education Act 1944: the efficient use of resources. It was included in the 1944 Act to ensure that there were sufficient school places for children between the ages of five
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
and 15. It was hoped that the school leaving age would rise to 16 in the not-too-distant future. The school leaving age was raised in 1969—a long time after the 1944 Act. Amendment No. 132 would ensure the efficient provision of school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 would provide a check and balance against duplication. If the Bill reaches the statute book as it stands, two authorities will exist. The funding agency for schools, appointed by the Secretary of State, will consist of 10 to 15 people who will direct the provision of education in a LEA education authority area. That job will be carried out alongside that of the democratically elected LEA. No demarcation exists in the Bill between the roles of the two authorities. The Minister has said that they will have "parallel responsibilities", which could mean that they carry out the same activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Potential for duplication exists. Amendment No. 133 would provide a trigger for the funding agency to become involved in the provision of school places in a LEA. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is not in his place, because he informed the Committee that he had been a member of a LEA in Warwickshire. He proudly defended local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a strong supporter of local government. I am a parish and a borough councillor and a Member of Parliament. The amendment would help to convince local authorities that the Government do not have a vendetta against local government. It would tell local authorities that in principle we want to promote grant-maintained schools—I would use the word "force"—but we shall see how the policy progresses. The amendment would reassure local government in that respect. It would also reassure LEAs that they have an accepted and valued role in the provision of school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 would trigger funding arrangements for schools when LEAs fail to carry out their statutory responsibilities. I shall return to that issue later. It is in the interests of the education community, of teachers and of pupils that resources are used efficiently. Teachers use resources in schools and pupils depend upon places being provided. Children should be able to demand the best possible education, using up-to-date textbooks in modern, well-equipped buildings. The Government have nothing to fear by accepting the efficient use of resources in the provision of school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed the practical use of resources in providing education. The classic, powerful example is the notion of surplus places. The Government said that there are 3·5 million surplus places—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up to 1·5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there are up to 1·5 million surplus school places at present. Although I do not accept that figure, there are some. If those surplus places are to be removed, it is vital that it is done in a strategic and co-ordinated fashion, using resources efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My greatest anxiety is that when LEAs try to reorganise their educational provision and schools are threatened with closure or reorganisation, by and large those schools apply for grant-maintained status, although there are one or two exceptions. Cheshire, my local education authority, applied to close Bankfield school in Widnes, in the Halton district—it is not in my constituency but I am familiar with it—because it had many surplus places. The school applied for grant-maintained status, which was granted. That frustrated the local education authority's attempt to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
rationalise their available school places. That was not the most efficient use of resources. Widnes is an old-established town based on the chemical industry and I am not sure that the correct decision was taken. However, it convinced me that the Government were prepared to grant any application for grant-maintained status. The Minister said that schools faced with closure which apply to opt out will necessarily be granted that status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to a primary school in my constituency which was proposed for a merger. The Secretary of State wisely decided that the school had a particular ethos and standards and he acceded to the campaign led by me, the school and by someone close to the Leader of the Opposition. When Walsingham school in my constituency was faced with closure, it applied for grant-maintained status and I supported that. The Secretary of State, in his wisdom, decided that it should close and it will close. That is an example of the Secretary of State taking into account the number of empty places and the quality of the schools. I do not necessarily agree with his decision, but it exemplifies his taking the kind of decision to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the intervention of the hon. Member for Battersea because it shows that the Department for Education made two contradictory decisions on applications for grant-maintained status— one was granted and one was refused. There is clearly a recipe for confusion. The Minister laughs, but we have been told by the hon. Member for Battersea that a school in Wandsworth, when faced with closure, applied to opt out but was refused. I used the example of Bankfield school in Widnes, which, when faced with closure, applied for and was given grant-maintained status. If that is not a recipe for confusion I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, instead of laughing about those examples needs to make a commitment this afternoon that under no circumstances will any school faced with closure be given grant-maintained status. Further than that, he could insert such a provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being repetitive, if not deliberately obtuse. We may have to get used to that. Mrs. Winterton, you have not had the pleasure of Chairing the Committee for long. I hope that you do not get carried away in the white heat of the arguments that occur from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have told the Committee not once but several times —I am happy to repeat it ad nauseam—that the Secretary of State believes that a school cannot escape closure by applying for grant-maintained status. It is now and will remain his responsibility to judge whether an application for grant-maintained status is viable and supportable from the point of view of education. He will take that view and will take it even-handedly as the case referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea exemplified so well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Government say certain things and act differently. When the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), the then Secretary of State for Education, spoke on the Second Reading of the Education Reform Act 1988, he promised that grant-maintained schools would be given the same funding as schools under LEA control. We have since been told that that is not the case. Ministers' words need to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
backed by legislation. Then we shall be convinced. I am prepared to accept that no more schools facing closure which apply for grant-maintained status will be given it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise the validity of my hon. Friend's point. No matter what Ministers say about their intention not to allow schools to opt out in order to escape closure, does my hon. Friend agree that schools have been allowed to do exactly that? If schools in the past year or two have been allowed to opt out in order to avoid closure —there is one in my constituency—surely there is more reason to give credence to the words of Ministers today than there was two or three years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury for her comments because they futher exemplify our point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been much talk about savings made by reducing the number of places in schools. It is much overstated. I wonder how my hon. Friend will react to that. School budgets under LMS are driven by the age-weighted pupil unit, so there are no classrooms in schools that are heated and lit, and full of books, and contain teachers but no pupils. Perhaps the Minister, if he finds time to finish his conversation, will heed that point. The amendment is important. When the number of places is reduced, closure of schools will result. That is the only way to reduce the number of places and those closures will cause great agony in the communities and great conflict between the funding agencies and the LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's valid point emphasises the practical difficulties that LEAs face in acting on surplus school places. One of the most difficult decisions that an LEA has to make is to threaten a school with closure. Given that the Government are intent on using the financial stick to beat LEAs and force them to tackle the problem of surplus places, while at the same time advocating the introduction of grant-maintaned schools, LEAs face a considerable problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that a school that was faced with closure and applied to opt out would not necessarily be granted that right. If he accepted the amendment, he would reassure the Committee and education at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A paradox of clause 7 is that when the funding agency achieves the 75 per cent, position, there will be a complete transfer of LEA responsibility for provision of surplus school places to the funding agency. The agency should be governed by the provision of the Education Act 1944 with regard to efficient use of resources. The funding agency may in time have to rationalise places in a former LEA area. It will threaten schools with closure. Those schools will apply to opt out and may be given grant-maintained status. They will then come under the direct funding of the agency. The Government must come to terms with that interesting paradox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 relates also to additional school places. New resources will be needed for growing communities with increasing demands because of a growing school population. Warrington area has a new town in north Cheshire that has a growing population. When the trigger point in Cheshire reaches 10 per cent, the funding agency for schools will be given responsibility to provide sufficient school places. The LEA will be given similar responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the LEA will wish to deal with the problem in a different way. It may wish to provide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
additional places in existing schools—to expand, to provide additional classrooms and facilities and the necessary finance. The funding agency may wish to create a new grant-maintained school that would not be subject to parental ballot or choice. This would bring about a problem that the Minister would have to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said at this morning's sitting that where there is conflict between the strategic roles of the funding agency for schools and the local education authority, the Minister will be the final arbiter. If we build into clause 7 amendment No. 137, which relates to the efficient use of resources, we need not rely upon the Minister being even-handed or putting his prejudices to one side. He has told us that he wants every school in the country to become grant-maintained and I understand that he told the Select Committee on Education that he would not mind presiding over the demise of local education authorities. He would have a simple yardstick or criterion—the efficient use of resources—on which to judge a request. It might make for greater efficiency to allow the LEA to expand the school and increase the number of pupils than allow the funding authority to build a new school. I hope that the Minister will deal with his important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An ancillary point to that is the question whether, if the Secretary of State for Education decides in favour of a new grant-maintained school that is not subject to parental ballot because no parents will be involved, he will consult the LEA and the local community. Will he also consider the need to consult parents in general? I feel sure that an answer to that straightforward question will be forthcoming because the Minister has taken note of a number of points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of the efficient use of resources relates not only to revenue but to capital. No doubt the Minister will confirm that the Government have made their intention clear: over the next three years 25 per cent, of the capital allocation for schools will go to the funding agency for schools. That is a disproportionate allocation of capital resources. It may mean that LEA schools that need minor, but essential capital work to maintain the structure of their buildings could be put to one side because the resources may be used by the funding agency for schemes of lesser priority. We need guidance from the Minister about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 7 is amended by amendment No. 132, the capital allocations to schools would be covered by the efficient use of resources. It is in everybody's interests to accept that addition to the amendment, which strengthens the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 would introduce into clause 7 a safeguard against duplication. If the Bill is passed unamended, there will be duplication—the arguments have been used time and time again. If the Government accept amendment No. 133, the trigger point for the activities of the funding agency for schools will be when the LEAs fail to meet their statutory requirement to provide sufficient school places. The amendment is a simple and straightforward way to prevent duplication, to allow the LEAs to carry out their statutory responsibilities and to save money on bureaucracy and duplication. I hope that the Minister will give some detailed consideration to this trigger point, which is an essential part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow for the circumventing of potential circumstances. Additional school places may be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
promoted in grant-maintained schools, regardless of the perceived or actual surplus places in state schools. The amendment would stop that happening. There is a good financial reason why the Minister should accept amendment No. 133.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that the Opposition are suspicious of the way in which the funding agency for schools will work. Every Opposition amendment has aimed to build in democratic accountability. These two amendments would provide practical measures, which would help the Government to achieve their aims, to build in safeguards for financial probity and to ensure that there is no duplication in the provision of what the Minister accepts as locally provided education service. By accepting the two amendments, the Minister will go some way to assure us that we are not misguided in our interpretation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I rise to speak to amendment No. 132 and those that follow, as they affect the Principality. The view of most people who are involved in education in Wales is that the combined operation of the LEA and the schools funding council in Wales would create chaos and confusion. The efficient provision of school places, which lies at the heart of the amendments, would be seriously jeopardised if we were to accept clause 7 as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said this morning, in six months the Government have changed their minds as to the way in which clause 7 should affect the Principality. Amendment No. 132 is important because it ensures that flexibility is introduced to the provision of school places in Wales. The Government found that the message slowly crept up on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It dawned upon the Minister that local government reorganisation in Wales might give him a better chance of having opt-out grant-maintained schools in Wales. The Minister could ask, as he has in the past, that local authorities come up with a reorganisation scheme to ensure that surplus school places—of which there are 118,000 in Wales—should be removed. What would happen in a small unitary authority such as my own, where there are 90,000 people and one further education college, which is in the hands of the Further Education Funding Council? The Catholic comprehensive school—one of only two in the whole of Gwent—might try to opt out. If it did, great confusion would ensue. What would happen if the Welsh medium school—the only one in Gwent, which might become six new unitary authorities—opted out and went grant-maintained? The same question could be asked if one or two of the five LEA schools decided to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be six bodies dealing with the provision of education in a valley 10 miles long by three miles wide. That is hardly a recipe for the efficient provision of school places, with which the amendment is concerned. The Minister knows that there is a difference between local education authorities in the Principality and those in England. Over the years, the Welsh authorities have over-provided—in the best sense of the term—for various aspects of education. For example, they have provided tertiary education and led the field in many parts of Wales. Nursery provision by LEAs in Wales has been first class

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
and well above that provided by their English counterparts. There is also the very special problem of Welsh language education. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham (Mrs. Prentice) spoke earlier about music and cultural activities. Such activities have been developed through the work of the local education authority as a planning and strategic body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither choice nor diversity will result if that structure is fragmented, with LEAs on the one hand, on the other hand grant-maintained schools, on the other hand the Further Education Funding Council and on the other hand the diocesan authorities. That will be a jungle, and a recipe for disaster and chaos in Wales. That is why every body involved with education in Wales has rejected the idea decisively. I am shocked and dismayed that in the six months between the White Paper and the Bill the distinctive Welsh difference—which had maintained the good aspects of LEAs—was destroyed because the Minister slavishly followed the rulings of the Department of Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what happened over the review of the English syllabus and the standards of GCSE —the Welsh HMI was satisfied on all counts and did not want to be included in the English review inspired by the Secretary of State—is that not another example of the Welsh Office being browbeaten to follow the English pattern? It is not an isolated case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a classic example. Originally, and rightly, the Welsh Office took great notice of the consultation exercise that was undertaken. The Minister told me in a parliamentary answer last week that he has decided that the results will not be made public. The local government reform consultation exercise produced two boxes of material which are now in the Library of the House. Why cannot we have the results of the education consultation? It is because the exercise resulted in a rejection of the changes that have been brought in in England. We in Wales do not want the rubbish that is peddled over there. The Principality is different. The Minister knows it, and that is why he has changed his mind. The Minister may laugh, but if he came to Wales and peddled his rubbish he would soon be told to go back to England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends raised the issues of surplus places. The amendment deals with the efficient use of school places as laid down by the Education Act 1944. The Minister of State, Welsh Office has several times in the past few years written to LEAs in Wales telling them that they should reorganise to save money when dealing with the 118,000 surplus school places. That is right and proper. He has liaised with the LEAs so to do, but the problem is that of the three grant-maintained schools in Wales two were to be closed by the LEA because they did not merge into the reorganisation proposals that the Minister initiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scenario is this: the Minister writes to Gwent county council saying that it must reorganise to save surplus places and Gwent county council writes back to the Minister and says that it has done that and presents the plans. Two schools decide to opt out and he allows them to do so because he is so bereft of schools prepared to opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to the number of grant-maintained schools in Wales. I should like to bring him up to date. Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan in Abergele in my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
constituency has today been told by the Secretary of State that it, too, can become grant-maintained. Will the hon. Gentleman join me in congratulating the governors, the head teacher and the parents of that school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That leaves only 2,113 to go out of the 2,117 schools in Wales. Perhaps that is the upsurge to which the Minister referred on Second Reading. So desperate is the Minister for schools in Wales to opt out that on 30 October he wrote to every chairman of governors of schools in Wales. I have frequently been a school governor, but I have never received a letter from the Minister, so things have obviously changed. He presumably sent this two-page letter to a couple of thousand chairmen. It says that he wants to point out the misgivings that school governors have had in the past few months and he wants to clarify the position on funding, on the role of the proposed funding council, and on services provided by LEAs—all matters that we shall deal with later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must have cost a bob a two to send that letter to every school in Wales. The Government must be desperately searching for schools that want to opt out. That is causing confusion in the minds of the men and women in Wales who have decided to serve the community by being school governors. We were told this morning that local education authorities are trying to persuade school governors not to accept grant-maintained status. The Government are also trying to persuade school governors—and with Government money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the aid of my party's finances, I intend to write, as the Minister's shadow, to every governing body in Wales to put the opposite view to that of the Government. I hope that governing bodies will come to a sensible decision and realise that the system that we have had in Wales in the past 10 years should continue. Local education authorities have done sterling work. That is why I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had answered all the charges made by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) earlier today. I thought that at least I had convinced him that the changes made between the White Paper and the Bill were not attributable to our views on local government reform in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper that outlined the proposal for 23 unitary authorities in Wales was published in March and antedated the publication of the White Paper. The hon. Gentleman is right: there are many vested interests in education, including that of the local education authority. Although his party and mine are in favour of unitary authorities, there is no doubt that if we go ahead with the proposal, it will affect the remaining eight county local education authorities. Those LEAs know it only too well. It is with some anticipation of local government reorganisation that local education authorities in Wales have become aware of their possible predicament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Gentleman, in advance of our White Paper on local government reorganisation, that we anticipate that unitary authorities will continue to have responsibility for education in much the same way as the existing LEAs. However, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, the unitary authorities will be smaller than the existing counties and will undoubtedly collaborate with each other in providing education services.

The hon. Member for Torfaen referred to the consultation. There is a simple reason why we cannot put the responses to that consultation in the Library. As was explained in a written answer, we did not ask those responding to the White Paper whether we could disseminate their responses. Therefore, we have no option but to preserve the confidentiality of the replies. If the hon. Gentleman wants to know who replied and so on, he should table a Question asking me to list the respondents and I shall consider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact I did so only this morning. The consultation papers on the reform of local government are in the Library, but those on education are not, although the exercise was carried out simultaneously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simple. When we consulted on the local government issues, we forewarned those tendering replies and asked their permission to place their responses in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the simple answer to this problem to contact those who responded to the White Paper and ask them if their responses can be published? That would be open government, as promised in the citizens charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly a possibility, but it is not an ideal way to proceed. When consultation is on a confidential basis, it does not savour well to write again to those who responded to ask them whether we may divulge the contents of their replies. There is a simpler answer. If I respond favourably to this morning's question from the hon. Member for Torfaen and produce a list of respondents, there is nothing to prevent a member of the Committee from writing to them asking for a copy of their responses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After inviting responses to the White Paper, was it merely an oversight that the Minister did not consider putting them in the Library, or a deliberate act to ensure confidentiality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of ensuring confidentiality. As I have explained, the hon. Gentleman can write to the respondents, but there is the issue of proper behaviour by the Government in dealing with responses given to them in good faith. Surely we should respect the confidentiality in which they were given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: this has been a revealing little debate in many ways. It has also been a sad experience. One thing that it revealed was a concept that our American friends, who often have interesting additions to our language that I appreciate, would call mindset. To me, the clue to the mindset of Opposition Members came from the hon. Member for Bath who, in his excitement, spoke twice of pigs' snouts in a trough, which I took to refer to the LEAs and the funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it sad that a member of the Committee should approach a subject such as the future of education on the basis that the joint role of those who carry the responsibility—the LEAs, whose role will continue, and the funding agency—can be regarded in terms of pigs and troughs? That is not how I or my hon. Friends see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no difficulty accepting the concept of shared responsibility of this sort when we reflect upon the extent
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
to which parents may choose, through ballot, whether to have their school organised other than by their local education authority or to continue under its aegis. We see this as a natural co-operative regime rather than as hostility or enmity, or as people trying to do down schools or parents. It is sad, although revealing, that Opposition Members see matters in those terms. I hope that, as time passes, they will see it in a more positive light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been two different interpretations of the relationship between funding agencies for schools and LEAs. All this morning, the Minister told the Committee that there would be parallel, but not shared, responsibility. He now talks of shared responsibility. Where is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably a bit of both. I do not have any great problem with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me get on a bit, first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to help the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always accept help when it is offered and I will accept the hon. Gentleman's help in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem is that Opposition Members are still stuck in the groove of thinking that only local education authorities will ever be capable of providing education or planning for it in any way. They are stuck in a time warp that does not allow the possibility of moving forward, developing or changing. That is a sad response to the imaginative ideas in the White Paper and the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about powers that are highly emotive and will involve value judgments—for example, the power to close a school would give rise to high emotion. It is not appropriate to say that the responsibility may be shared. One organisation must have legal responsibility for deciding to close schools. It may be knockabout stuff for the Committee, but those of us who have experienced the practical problems entailed in the removal of surplus places and the closure of schools know that parents will not accept a dual or shared responsibility. They will want to know where the responsibility lies. If they do not get a satisfactory reply, they will not rely on Parliament to interpret the law; they will go to the courts. There is, therefore, a practical necessity to make it clear who has the responsibility. It cannot be a bit of both. Responsibility must rest somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's help. He is absolutely right, as I hoped he would be. The responsibility in the grant-maintained sector, as defined in the Bill, will be with the funding agency for schools, and the responsibility in the continuing LEA sector will stay there. That is as it should be. I shall go on to develop this concept in reply to some of the points that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister an example, to see whether my interpretation of what he has just said fits? Let us suppose that the funding agency decides to use its powers under clause 40 to set up a brand-new grant-maintained school, but also decides that that will create surplus places, and therefore issues proposals to take out surplus places at two local authority schools in the same area, which might be bottom of the league table. Is the Minister saying that at no stage will the funding agency have that power? It would be helpful to the Committee if he clarified that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is the case. The funding agency will never have powers to propose closure in the continuing LEA sector. That is quite clear. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Before Opposition Members get over-excited, would they reflect for a moment on what I am saying, as I am trying to be helpful to them? We have said all along—it is part of the parallelism that the hon. Member for Devonport brought out rather effectively—that the parallel responsibilities operate in precisely this way: the funding agency for schools will have overall planning responsibilities for new schools, provision of places and closures in its sector, and the LEAs will have continuing responsibility in theirs, within the terms of the process defined in clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just said is very interesting, as it seems to confirm what we have tried to establish throughout the debate—that there is to be a parallel functioning of the two authorities. However, both he and the Secretary of State have also said on several occasions that they hoped that the two bodies would work together co-operatively. As far as I can see, the only provision of the Bill for which they will be forced to do that is for the exchange of information. That in itself will not make them work co-operatively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To enlighten the Committee, can the Minister give examples of ways in which the two bodies would work co-operatively, rather than in parallel? In response to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend about whether grant-maintained schools could recommend the closure of LEA schools, the Minister gave an excellent example of the way in which the two bodies would work in parallel. I cannot envisage cases in which they would work co-operatively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will depend on the geographic distribution of schools, the extent to which their areas might abut, the extent to which a co-operative approach will be required to define satisfactorily the provision of basic needs, and so on. I do not understand why Opposition members of the Committee have difficulty in grasping the concept of co-operation. They seem determined to see the matter only in terms of hostility between bodies that will have statutory duties for the provision of education. It is a sad comment on the minds of the Opposition that they assume that bodies charged in different ways with the provision of education should be hostile to each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can Opposition Members talk among themselves and decide who will go first, because they are queuing up? I must give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems unable to grasp one of the central points of concern to Opposition Members. The funding authority could open schools and provide education for children who are being squeezed by the lack of funds in the local authority sector. The Minister must realise that the catchment area for children attending grant-maintained schools will be the same as for those attending local authority schools. If the Minister provides extra funds for one sector at the expense of the other sector, the co-operation to which he refers is bound to fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the way that it would work. Funding authorities will not be able, as Opposition Members have suggested, to establish new schools at their whim or significantly to enlarge an existing school without first publishing statutory proposals. That will also apply to LEAs, funding authorities and voluntary bodies. After the proposals are published there will be a two-month period in which local people, schools or LEAs affected will be able to object. If objections are made, the matter will be determined by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the funding agency will be able to run riot and create unnecessary new schools all over the place is simply not true. The obligations upon the funding agency for schools in the Bill would prevent it from doing what Opposition Members suggest. There would be no reason for it to do so. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] Because apart from anything else, it would be an inefficient and inappropriate use of resources, which would be caught by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister address his mind to the point that I made earlier. An 11 to 16 grant-maintained school in Cambridgeshire wishes to establish a sixth form when there is already adequate LEA provision in that area, although not in the same place. What would the funding agency's attitude be in such a situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am too old a hand to get drawn into prejudging individual applications. That will be a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I help the hon. Member for Wallsend before he helps me again? I refer Opposition Members to schedule 2(3)(4). Under the heading "Responsibility for providing sufficient school places" it says:
	<br><q><p>"Nothing in this paragraph requires a funding authority to take any action where to do so would not be an effective use of their resources."</p></q>
Other parts of the Bill have similar provisions. There is nothing to suggest that the funding agency for schools will have the duty, the power or the capacity arbitrarily, casually or unnecessarily to create new schools just for the hell of it. They will have to take into account the basic needs of the area, whether the provision of schools is appropriate and all the other matters that are relevant now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does schedule 2 also provide that funding agencies must not do anything detrimental to the financial affairs of the local authority in the provision of education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From memory, no, I do not think that it does. The hon. Gentleman presumes that a public body would go out of its way to do something that would damage the interests of other public bodies. I suggest that that is not the way in which constitutional arrangements work. If that is his view of the world I feel sorry for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister look again at the schedule? It says that it would not be an effective use of "their" resources. Opposition Members are concerned about the effective use of overall resources for education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention of the Bill. That responsibility will reside ultimately, as it does now, with the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
