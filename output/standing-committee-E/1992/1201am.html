<br><br><!-- lb --> BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 3, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(2A) In respect of the exercise by the funding authority of functions in respect of any grant-maintained school, the Secretary of State shall make arrangements to secure that a copy of each direction is
	<ol>
	<li>delivered to such representative organisations of grant-maintained schools as he thinks fit; and</li>
	<li>made available to the governing body of every grant-maintained school.'.</li></ol></p></q>
I have already expressed my concern about the powers that the Bill will give the Secretary of State. Earlier, we discussed the power of the Secretary of State to appoint members of the funding authorities. Now, clause 6 gives him absolute power over the members of the funding authorities, and he will have the right to dismiss them should they take decisions of which he disapproves. One might say that, that is not just the belt and braces approach, but he is even using a piece of string.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, it is vital that the directions issued by the Secretary of State are consulted on as widely as possible and that the process is as open as possible. Like many Opposition members, I would ideally like a requirement that ensured that, before directions affecting graint-maintained schools were given, the Secretary of State discussed his proposals with the governing body of each GM school. However, I recognise that with the centralised structure that the Government are trying to impose through the Bill, consultation with so many groups would be impractical. Such a problem does not exist under the present arrangements for local education authorities and their schools. For example, in the major revision of the local managements of schools arrangement, LEAs are required to consult all of their schools. That is covered in section 34(4) of the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major problem of the Bill is that the structure proposed by the Secretary of State could ultimately lead him to have direct, personal control over all 24,000 schools; consultation would be administratively impossible. We have heard that the Secretary of State likes to think of himself as the nation's headmaster but, unfortunately, his door does not seem to be open to many people and it is unlikely to be open for consultation with the governors of all grant-maintained schools. It is inauspicious that he has recently moved to a sanctuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70—which we discussed last sitting —and amendment No. 71 are designed to introduce at least some of the features of openness and consultation that are already required by LEAs. There is genuine
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
openness in the work of the LEAs: they consult, they are accountable and they have public meetings. They must openly reach the decisions that affect children in LEA schools. The Bill would provide no guarantees that the Secretary of State would operate in the same open way for grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting, the Minister accepted the arguments for amendment No. 70, which dealt with the need to consult the funding authorities before issuing directions. It would have gone some way towards open decision making about grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 71 also deals with openness. It distinguishes between the two sorts of direction under clause 6. The amendment does not cover directions for purely internal management issues that affect the work of the funding authority. However, the Secretary of State will also issue directions that affect the interests of individual and collective grant-maintained schools. The amendment would ensure that such directions to the funding authority were delivered to organisations that represented grant-maintained schools and made available to the governing bodies of every grant-maintained school. If individual grant-maintained schools cannot be consulted about directions, they should receive details of directions that affect them as soon as possible. That will enable them to look ahead and plan effectively. Early notification about details of directions means that grant-maintained schools will receive them before the funding authorities have interpreted them. The schools may thus be able to influence the funding authorities' interpretation of the directions. The amendment is uncontroversial. It would increase open decision making. Just as the Minister accepted the argument for amendment No 70.1 hope that he will accept the argument for amendment No. 71.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Battle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been called many names before, but not that one. I welcome being called, even if I am linked to the Norman conquest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment includes some worthwhile ideas, which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will note, although its requirements are too detailed and specific. Last week, the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) provided Latin tags for the Committee. We batted caveat emptor and quis custodiet principles to and fro. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes means, "Who shall guard the guards?" but is often used in the case of the man who has locked up his wife because he does not trust her. Perhaps the hon. Member for Hemsworth had special reasons for referring to that branch of Juvenal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the declassification or demystification of the procedures. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) also supports that. The Bill covers schools, governing bodies, heads and communities that are not necessarily practised in dealing with funding formulae and procedures for capital bids. It would be helpful to have a ministerial assurance that grant-maintained schools will be able to know about changes that are made to formulae that will affect their funding bids and the way in which funding authorities will treat them. That applies especially to capital bids, which are a mystery to most LEA schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be good for the procedures and for the grant-maintained sector if grant-maintained schools could be guided about the correct way to submit a successful bid. I leave it to my hon. Friend the Minister to decide whether that should be achieved through a clause in the Bill or by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
him directing or advising the funding authorities to provide user-friendly guides for grant-maintained schools and to make significant changes known to the schools. I welcome this probing amendment, which is a useful vehicle for clarification on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) had made a valuable contribution. He brought out the distinction between the type of information that would usually be provided in the course of a well-conducted relationship between, in this instance, the Secretary of State, the funding agencies and the schools communities, and an attempt to prescribe in excessive detail, as the amendment does, the form that it should take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can do no better than revert to an earlier theme that I shall repeat as often as necessary. It is in the interests of the Secretary of State, the FAS and the grant-maintained sector that it all works as well as possible. We are not in the business of encouraging the new grant-maintained sector and then preventing or obstructing it from operating with maximum efficiency. I ask the Committee to begin from that shared position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the hierarchy of events that would begin with the Bill, which will set out the broad framework within which the agency would operate. It will proceed in the usual way, and guided by the non-departmental public bodies guidelines, the Secretary of State will set out the form of operation. We have mentioned annual reports, financial accounting, accountability and other aspects. All this will lead to a relationship developing between the FAS and the growing grant-maintained school sector. In that context it will be greatly in the interest of the agency and the schools to have the best information available at each point so that the relationship works properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that all that is common ground. Where I must take issue with the hon. Member for Bath is that I cannot accept the proposal in the amendment that
	<br><q><p>"a copy of each direction is … made available to the governing body of every grant-maintained school."</p></q>
It is possible, although I cannot predict this, that some directions may not apply to some grant-maintained schools. The education world may find this hard to believe so I shall have to be taken on trust, but my Department strives daily to reduce the amount of paper that it sends to schools and to local education authorities. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i>It is true. I thought that that might meet with incredulity, if not ribaldry, but it is one of our aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An amendment that proposes sending, automatically and unthinkingly a copy of each piece of paper to every school, regardless, runs counter to our attempt to cut to a sensible, workable level the amount of documentation that should be sent to head teachers and boards of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doubtful about the amendment's value, to say nothing of the cost that would result. We want the FAS to be a lean, fit organisation that will execute efficiently and cost-effectively the aims set out in the Bill, and in my right hon. Friend's guidelines. I do not want to put in the Bill a statutory instruction that every time something is decided, a piece of paper is to be sent to every school. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is to allow a sensible relationship to develop between the Secretary of State—through the guidelines that he lays down and the Bill's provisions—and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
the staff of the funding agency, who will want to know what they should tell schools about directions. I hasten to add in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea that the formulae setting out the funding arrangements will be in the public domain. They will be well known and understood and will result from extensive consultation. That starts next month with the consultation document, which will have the maximum transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in our interests that schools understand the basis on which funding will be made. Even in the past year or two, we have made significant strides towards telling existing schools—LEA and grant-maintained—about such things. That process has helped them to put their capital bids in context, and it will continue, which is in the interests of the Department, the Secretary of State of the day, and the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the objectives and spirit of the amendment. However the way in which such a provision would operate would be unhelpful. It would be bureaucratic, expensive and unwelcome to most head teachers. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment for those reasons and to accept that directions would work on the basis that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first comment on the Minister's remark about his Department's aim to reduce the amount of information given to schools. Without wishing to be out of order, I shall point out that if his Department got things right the first time—for example in different parts of the national curriculum—perhaps there would be no need to circulate so much information to schools. As for his comment on the cost of the exercise, I remind the Committee that the publication of examination results has cost, as I understand it, £1·4 million, money that could have been better spent on improving the quality of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his policy and that of his party is not to produce the information that we have just produced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Our policy is clear. We believe in providing maximum information to parents and governors. However, that information must be accurate and correctly "contextualised". For example, examinations results should be placed alongside information that ensures that people get a measure of the added value provided by schools, not just the raw results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet, because I want to respond to the Minister. As for the question of cost, again, there are many other cafes in which one must accept that there is an important need—which the Government accept—to provide information. The Government sent out a well-produced and clearly written White Paper. On some occasions it is appropriate to incur costs to make widely available information that affects people to such an extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the maximum information that the hon. Gentleman spoke about include examination results? If so, how would he pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to respond—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are moving away from the amendment. We should be talking about the directions that the Minister will give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take your directions on this matter, Mr. Martin. I hope that the record will show that in my response to the Minister I said that examinations results are part of the wealth of information that should be provided, but that those results should not be given in isolation. They should appear in the context of information that enables people to make judgments about the added value being provided by individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea made an important contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always. He acknowledged the need for information and said that it should be clear and timely. The Minister's response about timeliness was not as fulsome as I should have liked, but he gave us some assurances that information would be provided in the way that I sought. I hope that he will take on board also the issue of timeliness, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 3, line 20, after '(1)', insert
	<br><q><p>'subject to 1,500 schools having been approved for grant-maintained status in England and Wales,'.</p></q>
We have now come to one of the Bill's most important clauses. I hope that the Minister will sustain the attitude with which he debated the previous amendment, because if he does not listen to the perceptive criticism from people outside the House, clause 7 will cause chaos in our education system for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 is one of the clauses that causes most concern, especially among local authorities, which are responsible for the effective delivery of education through the school system. That anxiety cuts across the political divide. Conservative and Labour councillors are equally worried that clause 7 will create a planning nightmare in the future provision of sufficient school places. I hope that the Minister will adjust his normal attitude and, for once, listen to those people with a great expertise in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 159 may not be the most important amendment to the Bill, but discussion now of the idea behind it will give the Minister an opportunity to tell the Committee his ideas about the timing of the implementation of the clause. We have suggested that the trigger point for the operation of clause 7 should be the time when 1,500 schools have been approved for grant-maintained status in England and Wales. I do not want this debate to become a discussion about the failure of the movement towards grant-maintained status, nor an exchange of information about individual schools. What is important is the Minister's thinking about the implementation of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper, the Government stated:
	<br><q><p>"There will need to be a point at which the Funding Agency takes on some responsibility for securing sufficient, suitable places in the areas of individual LEAs"</p></q>
where more than 10 per cent, of pupils are in grant-maintained schools. However, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State altered that. I hope that the Minister will clarify the matter. The Secretary of State said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
	<br><q><p>"the funding agency will take on a parallel duty to ensure an adequate number of school places … There will be two bodies—the LEA and the funding agency—with parallel but not shared responsibilities."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213. c. 634–5.]</p></q>
The provision of parallel but not shared responsibilities will cause havoc when LEAs are trying to plan sufficient school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Committee last week, when my hon. Friends were exploring the possibility of a regional structure for the funding agency, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"There is a difference, in principle and in practice, between setting up an institution to deal with a known quantity and a known distribution of bodies, and pre-empting unknown growth and development … Establishing a formal, rigid structure from the start, without knowing how many grant-maintained schools there will be in different parts of the country is irresponsible folly".—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 24 November 1992; c. 220–1.]</p></q>
Yet, in clause 7, that same Minister promotes the idea that when the trigger point in the Bill is reached the funding agency should be responsible for providing sufficient school places. He is contradicting what he said last week on organisational principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone involved in the practical delivery of education is extremely worried about the clause. Confusion may arise, there may be different patterns in different parts of the country, and there will be some areas with funding agency responsibility for the provision of sufficient school places adjacent to other local authority areas where the funding agency has no responsibility and there may be transfer of pupils across those boundaries. I hope that the Minister will give us his views on the implementation of clause 7 and the confusion that Conservative as well as Labour councillors believe it will cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 7 is enacted as it stands, it will be impossible for either the funding agency or the LEA to plan for sufficient school places in any geographical area because they will have parallel powers and shared responsibility. We have tabled later amendments that would alleviate that difficulty by providing that the local authority plays a leading role, but I shall keep the arguments about that aspect until later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the Government have already made up their mind about the system that they will introduce and the powers that they will give to funding authorities under clause 7. The Minister is nodding his head in agreement. However, clause 7 will create chaos. I hope that the Minister will enligthen us about how he will amend it so as to avoid the chaos that everyone involved in education believes will be created by the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the misgivings of the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor). They stem naturally from the rather cosy monopolistic position that people have been in for as long as they can remember, and that they now find to be threatened. The basis of the concept of grant-maintained status is that a school and its parents can decide that they would rather have a regime other than that of the monopoly local education authority. A workable framework then has to be provided for the operation, funding and planning of schools as an alternative to the system to that the school has balloted freely to leave. Although I understand the concerns of the hon. Lady, it is as natural as night following day that we should seek, and, indeed, be obliged, to provide an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
alternative framework of operation for the growing grant-maintained school sector and not leave things untended or in the control of the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to clause 7, which, as the hon. Lady said, is an essential part of the Bill. We must decide whether we want a straightforward cut-off point or transition in each local education authority area or nationally—as the amendment proposes—or to adopt a more phased approach. After much deliberation, we decided that the latter was the better way to proceed. As the hon. Lady has asked me to, I shall describe briefly to the Committee how I expect the regime to work, although we may return later to more detailed consideration of some of its operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LEA will remain responsible for maintained schools and the funding authority will be responsible for grant-maintained schools. That flows naturally from earlier clauses. The hon. Lady concentrated on the period between the 10 per cent, trigger and the 75 per cent, exit point, if I can put it that way. Both bodies will be able to bring forward statutory proposals only in respect of their own sector. But, when considering the needs of their particular sectors, both bodies will have to take account of the provision that exists in the other sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that period, we would expect much of the impetus for the increase in school places to meet a projected shortfall of places to come from the grant-maintained schools as they respond to the demand for places from parents or changes that are taking place in their locality. Proposals may also come from the voluntary sector. Where proposals come forward from the governing body of a grant-maintained school, they will be judged by the Secretary of State in a similar way to proposals from the governing body of a voluntary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such proposals would essentially respond to parental choice. LEAs will need to carry out a more strategic planning role in partnership with funding authorities, if we are to ensure that there are sufficient school places. Both LEAs and funding authorities will therefore need to have information about the needs of the area and the provision already made in the other sector. That is why clause 5 places a duty on LEAs to provide funding authorities with such information as they require in order to fulfil their functions. Similarly, funding authorities will be required to give information to LEAs to enable them to fulfil their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That information will include birth figures, attendance figures, the number of pupils attending independent or special schools, the level of migration in and out of the area, the number of pupils receiving education other than at school and the number of dwellings built or planned. That is the material with which any authority—local education or funding—responsible for the strategic planning of the provision of school places would naturally be concerned. That is no more and no less than what an efficient and effective authority does already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister deals with strategic planning, which he is now touching on, we should like more detail than he is giving us. No doubt we shall have an opportunity to discuss the matter in more detail later, but I have two questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister said that the two separate bodies, the LEA and the funding authority, would be required to take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
account of the provision in the other sector. I believe that I am quoting the Minister correctly. Will there be criteria in the strategic planning and the decisions arising from it, to ensure that provision in the other sector is taken into account and that no duplication or waste of money will occur? Secondly, can the Minister give me a single example anywhere in the world of two bodies operating as the Minister describes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not offhand, but I shall have a look and see whether I can come up with any. I am not sure how relevant that is, nor whether we in the United Kingdom have a tradition of doing something only if it is done somewhere else in the world. That may be comforting and reassuring for the hon. Gentleman, but I should have thought that he, as a thrusting radical, would be more imaginative than that. It shows how political concepts and philosophies change over time, but I shall leave that for another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is self-evidently yes. Any authority that dispenses public moneys, as LEA and the FAS will do, each in its own way, will be obliged to take account of existing provision when planning for other provision. I expect all the authorities to continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference is that the LEA may increasingly need to obtain information about grant-maintained schools in its area. That, I think, is the point that the hon. Gentleman was making. It is not new, as LEAs that already have great-maintained schools in their areas are, presumably already engaged in the process of taking account of that information. The establishment of the funding authority should help not hinder them in that task. It will be business as usual. I should be surprised and disappointed if the exchange of information between the LEAs and the funding authorities did not continue at both formal and informal levels. We have already dealt with that in our discussion of clause 5, which underpins the entire process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the exchange of information between the LEAs and the funding authority should mean that both are clear what demands there will be for additional places in the LEA area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said, "the LEAs and the funding authority" and, a few seconds before that, "the LEAs and the funding authorities". Will he clarify whether clause 7 applies to both England and Wales, and whether the words "Secretary of State" in the clause mean the Secretaries of State for Wales and for Education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that must be yes. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I was grammatically inconsistent. That was unintentional.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of grammar. There has been a change in the contents of clause 7 between the White Paper and the Bill with respect to Wales. The figures of 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, which appear in the clause now apply to Wales, although originally they did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our hope is that there will be a continuing dialogue and an exchange of views between the funding agencies and the LEAs about the best way to meet the needs that they have identified in their different ways. To date, the LEA has not been able to act in a way that co-ordinates action with the grant-maintained sector. The provisions of the Bill will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
make that possible. An essential aspect of the activities of the funding agency for schools and of clause 7 is to provide a strategic planning framework for the grant-maintained sector alongside that of the LEA. Without it, there would be no such facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an analysis has been made of the existing provisions within an authority's area, the best way to provide the additional places required may become obvious. In most instances, a common view will emerge about the type of additional provision that would best meet the needs of the locality. That is not dissimilar from the judgment that LEAs currently have to make when deciding whether to encourage the expansion of a voluntary school or to propose the extension of a county school. The best solution might prove to be the significant enlargement of an existing school or the provision of a completely new school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I concede that agreement might not be reached. When it is not, both the LEA and the funding authority will be free to bring forward statutory proposals. It would then fall to the Secretary of State, taking account of the views of parents and other interested parties, to decide what would be most appropriate. What could be more natural if the authorities cannot agree than for both authorities to have the freedom to bring differing ideas to the Secretary of State? When considering bringing forward its own proposals, the funding authority will have information from the LEA about the need for places—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my sentence, if I may. It may also, in some instances, wish to purchase other professional advice from outside consultants or from the Office for Standards in Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which side would the Secretary of State be more likely to take when a dispute occurs between the funding agency and the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State would, as ever, be completely impartial and even-handed. He would have the interests of pupils at heart, as he always does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister just say that the Secretary of State may have the power to seek advice from other bodies? He could, therefore, bring forward his own proposals as an alternative to those submitted by the LEA and by the funding authority. If that is the case, is not it strange that the Secretary of State will deliberate on his own proposals? What sort of impartiality is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the advantage of reading from a text today. That is unusual for me, but safer in this case. I repeat my words, as the hon. Lady may have misheard me: when considering bringing forward its own proposals, the funding authority will have information from the LEA about the need for places but it may also in some instances wish to purchase other professional advice from consultants or from Ofsted. I was referring to the ability of the funding authority to seek the best information available from wherever it may be in order to judge its planning responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have further clarification of that point? I may be wrong, but I believe that it differs from the proposals in the White Paper. Will the Minister confirm that the Secretary of State's choice when there is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
difference of opinion within a geographical area is only between the proposal put forward by the LEA and that proposed by the funding council? He cannot draw into the argument a third, or subsequent proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am advised that in clause 210, the facility arises for further proposals to be made when appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the Secretary of State, possibly following a public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment is about the triggering mechanism. The Committee is discussing matters that will arise in other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I want to help the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) rather than confusing her, but I suspect that when we debate clause 210—I hope that we will get there eventually, if not today—we shall explore the issue. There is a further available facility, which is important in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that and I look forward to clause 210. As the records show, the Minister's comments are—if I might say, in the kindest sense—misleading. I would not want anybody to be under the misapprehension that the Secretary of State will be unable to decide between three options—that of the LEA, the funding council and his own. I would put a fair bet on the fact that he would be biased towards his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is for the hon. Lady to judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we do not make overly heavy weather of the role of the Secretary of State as it unfolds in the Bill. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I shall tell the Committee why I say that. Secretaries of State already have substantial powers, which is right. The fact that the Bill contains a description of differing powers for the Secretary of State may alarm some members, but if they reflect on it, they will realise that that is a natural way to proceed. They should not get too obsessed—if I may use that term in an affectionate way —by that part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept the comments made in 1987 by the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), who stated that the Secretary of State for Education had more powers than any other Secretary of State? Since that time, more than 400 additional powers have been created by the 1988 Act and the further 44 powers are proposed in the Bill. We are concerned about the powers of this particular Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment before us does not deal with the powers of the Secretary of State, but deals with a triggering mechanism and the various bodies that are involved with that. We are not discussing the Secretary of State. Further amendments will deal with the powers of the Secretary of State, and then the Committee will debate that point. We shall keep to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous respect for the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup on educational matters, not least because it was he who appointed as Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Thatcher. What greater tribute could there be to his judgment on education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the Minister down that path by reminding him of the number of grammar schools that that particular Secretary of State closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential for conflict between the funding authority and the LEA is central to the clause, which is why we think that the clause's implementation should be delayed. So far, the Minister has considered that argument in the context of the need for an expansion in the number of places. One of the greatest areas of conflict will arise if there are surplus places in an area. We have had many macho statements from the Secretary of State about how tough he will be about surplus places. A few minutes ago, the Minister said that the Secretary of State would be impartial in such conflicts—a statement that I found quite incredible. How can the funding authority itself be impartial on surplus places, when it will have a vested interest in luring any school that is threatened by closure into the grant-maintained sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear on many occasions that it is not in our interests, as a Government or as people interested in education, to lure schools—especially those that may be under threat of closure—into any sector. That would be unproductive and it would make no sense to establish as grant-maintained schools those schools that had already demonstrated that they were unpopular, failing and undersubscribed. The Secretary of State is turning down such applications and will continue to feel free to do so, if he thinks that they are inappropriate. The idea that there is, somehow, an escape route for schools that are threatened with closure into the grant-maintained sector, either now or in the future, is quite wrong. I hope that the Committee will discount it completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the funding authority decides that it should, itself, propose changes to schools or the establishment of a new school, it will be required to consult those who have an interest. The way it does so will no doubt vary according to the type of proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the consultation process has been carried out the funding authority will need to publish proposals locally, as it would with any other related planning matter, in a similar way to the way in which the LEA currently publishes such proposals. This will normally be achieved as it is now, for example by asking the relevant schools to display the notices on their premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposals made by the funding authority will require the approval of the Secretary of State if he gives notice to that effect or if objections have been made. If the proposals do not attract any objections and the Secretary of State does not call in the proposals they will be decided by the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implementation of proposals will rest with the governing body either of the existing grant-maintained school, as provided for in clause 89, or the governing body of a prospective grant-maintained school as provided for in clause 45. The funding authority will be responsible for making the necessary grants to enable the premises to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped the Committee's notice that from the 10 per cent, limit voluntary bodies will also be able to propose the establishment of new grant-maintained schools. It will be for those bodies to put forward proposals in a similar way to the way in which voluntary bodies put forward proposals for new voluntary schools. The funding authority would have to be consulted before
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
such proposals were published. It and interested parties, specified in schedule 3, part II, would also have the right to submit objections to the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last few comments were significant. So far, the grant-maintained sector has been allowed to develop only if parents vote in a positive way in favour of their school becoming grant-maintained. What the Minister has just said—and I hope that he will confirm it—is that the Bill will give the funding agency the authority, under clause 40, to set up a totally new, grant-maintained school. More importantly, it will need to consult only—there will be no need for a parental ballot. The result could be the rapid development of the grant-maintained sector through funding agency initiatives, without parental ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, because it is the responsibility of the funding agency for schools, as the strategic planning authority, to provide places where appropriate. To deny it that facility would be to undermine its strategic planning powers. What the hon. Gentleman said is self-evidently true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am a little confused. The Minister has just said that the funding agency will be a strategic planning authority, yet he told us about 10 minutes ago that the LEA would retain that role. Will he clarify which is which?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both. I shall return to the amendment, lest it be thought that I have paid it no attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a probing amendment, or mischievous, but I have examined it carefully. However, given the terms in which i have described the different responsibilities of LEAs and the funding agency, the amendment's attempt to ensure that 1,500 schools must be approved for grant-maintained status in England and Wales before the funding agency comes into operation is unacceptable. The amendment shows no sensitivity to the requirements of different areas. Sensitivity and flexibility towards the needs of different areas are fundamental to the structure of the Bill and to the way in which we envisage that it will progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is self-evident—if perhaps regrettable—that grant-maintained schools are making more progress in some parts of the country than in others. To prevent the funding agency, with all of its strategic planning responsibilities, from coming into effect before the total of grant-maintained schools had reached 1,500 would deny the purpose of the Bill. More importantly, it would deny us the facility to plan properly provision in the grant-maintained sector in large parts of the country before the threshold was reached. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the trigger mechanism? When that 10 per cent, level is reached in any area for any sector, will the transfer of responsibility be automatic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Automatic is not the right word. There must be an element of discretion so that the power would not be used if, for any reason—I cannot envisage one at the moment—the crossing of that threshold was unworkable or absurd. We have included this provision to make it clear for planning purposes and for parents about to ballot that the 10 and 75 per cent, levels are significant for the transfer of responsibilities between LEAs and the funding agency

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
for schools. Although there must be a degree of discretion as a safeguard, it is intended that in most cases where the threshold is passed, responsibility will also pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will consider the situation that is likely to arise in Wales, especially after the reorganisation of local government. The 10 per cent, level may be reached by only one school becoming grant maintained. I would like an assurance that that would not necessarily trigger the process.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office, that that situation is extremely unlikely—he may want to check that. He says that the 10 per cent, level may be reached by a few schools becoming grant maintained, but not by just one. I can think of one or two LEAs where that may apply, but they are not in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will happen after the reorganisation? I have been given the example of Holyhead school in a reorganised Gwynedd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might give way to my right hon. Friend if he wants to intervene, because I am not qualified to comment on the detailed provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to reply—I am taking my time. It might be better if my right hon. Friend were to write to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) and give him a proper, considered reply. It is sometimes tempting for less statesmen-like Ministers such as myself to try to give spontaneous, if inaccurate, answers. My right hon. Friend, who is statesman-like, will probably want to give the hon. Gentleman a proper reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way—it is on the same point but concerning the English dimension. What would happen if a large secondary school in an urban area took pupils from across the boundaries who were not resident in the local authority area but were attracted to that school? If that school became grant maintained and the majority of its pupils were not resident in that local authority area, could that trigger the 10 per cent, mechanism?—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me make the point that members of the public are not allowed to approach the Committee. I shall remove anyone who does so. Researchers have nothing to do with the Committee; they are present as members of the public and should remain seated in the Public Gallery and not approach members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is, yes, where appropriate. I doubt whether the exact circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described would apply. There are, increasingly, large cross-border migrations. A substantial number of pupils, although not the majority, may be affected. The issue would have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. That would determine whether, when planning and other responsibilities shared by LEAs and the funding agency for schools was taken into account, it was sensible for a transfer to take place. The Bill states that the Secretary of State "may", not "will" make an order to effect such a transfer. We did not believe that it was right to mandate the transfer mechanistically at the 10 or 75 per cent, trigger point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. The Minister used the phrase "where appropriate". It would be useful if the Minister gave some illustrations of cases where the Secretary of State might consider it appropriate to exercise that discretion, for example, when many pupils crossed the border from another local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give an example, riskily, off the cuff. If rationalisation proposals in the pipeline are being considered, when the final ballot that crosses the threshold takes place, the Secretary of State would want to take a view of the background of the case when the threshold was crossed. Education is not static. Rightly, LEAs make changes in their schools. A ballot could take place against a background of proposed or imminent changes. I hope that the Committee agrees that granting the Secretary of State discretion makes sense in such circumstances. An over-mechanistic approach is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt proceedings, but we are now discussing other amendments. We are considering amendment No. 159. Perhaps we should dispose of amendment No. 159 and then go on to matters that the Committee considers to be more important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I was trying to do that. I always give way to members of the Committee when appropriate. I had reached the point of asking the Committee to reject amendment No. 159.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall give way, but the hon. Gentleman must satisfy the Chairman, not me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The Committee is confused about the 1,500 schools and the marrying in of the funding authority. The beautifully written White Paper states that, by April 1994, there will be 1,500 grant-maintained schools. I do not wish to argue the rights or wrongs of the figure. However, we should discuss the reason for the figure later, as the arguments for it are not convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is sure that there will be 1,500 grant-maintained schools by April 1994, I am worried about why the Minister is worried. Funding authorities will have to be set up for those schools. If matters progress well, there will be no problem for the Minister. However, in recent Budgets, the Government's forecasts have not been wholly accurate, but I shall not stray on to that matter. If the Government's forecasts are inaccurate, this creature, the funding agency—set up at considerable cost and vying with civil servants as to who does what, and with local authorities, which themselves will be undergoing reorganisation—will be a total mess. Fifteen hundred schools are involved, and if the numbers are there, accepting the amendment should not be a problem; if they are not, the amendment would offer a real, and necessary, safeguard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, unusually for him, is missing the point: he is making the speech that he wishes that he had made earlier. That is no bad thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create a number of difficulties. First, if there were 1,499 schools by April 1994 and, because of the amendment, we were unable to set up the agency, we would be left with the nonsense of a large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
grant-maintained sector and no facility to plan properly for it. Surely the hon. Gentleman does not consider that ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more important, the whole essence of what we are attempting in the Bill, with the 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, trigger points, is to be sensitive to the differing rate of development of the grant-maintained sector in LEA areas. It is wrong to take a global view, and say that unless there are a considerable number of grant-maintained schools, there will be no funding agency, when in some LEA areas by that stage—who knows?—all schools might be grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard of one or two local authorities with more than 50 per cent, of such schools, so we could reach that stage quickly. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we deny the important mechanism of the agency in these areas because other parts of the country have not succumbed, or caught up, as it were. Therefore, the amendment, however ingenious, runs against the thrust and philosophy of the Bill. The Committee should reject it for that reason and for the detailed reasons that I gave to the hon. Member for Hemsworth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that there are already sufficient mechanisms in place. I accept that the Minister wishes to introduce funding authorities. I understand that, but he can set them up at the time. Doing so beforehand would not help individual schools—the pupils and customers—because adequate mechanisms exist. If the Minister wishes to do so later, I would not object to a bit of odd arithmetic. I recall that the Department, the Minister or the Secretary of State used the term "sevenfold"—a wholly inaccurate mathematical term if one examines the statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is like the word "decimation", which suffers the same misinterpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was incorrect in saying that there are already adequate mechanisms. That is precisely not so. LEAs do not have planning authority over the grant-maintained sector. Because grant-maintained schools opted out of LEA control freely, the Bill's mechanisms are essential. It is not good enough to say that if we leave it as it is, or wait until there are 1,500 schools in the sector, all will be well. It will not, because, in the meantime, the grant-maintained sector will be unplanned. That would be unacceptable. That is why the sensitivity of LEAs areas to the 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, threshold was judged carefully by those of us who put the Bill together. The purpose was to show that sensitive reaction to the different development in the grant-maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is saying that the system is unplanned if the funding agency is in operation, that would apply especially in respect of the primary sector, even below the 10 per cent, threshold. As the Minister is aware, in many LEAs, while it would be possible for a small number of secondary schools to trigger the 10 per cent, mechanism, it would require far more in the primary sector. I do not want to tempt the Minister to lower the 10 per cent, margin, but he must realise that there is a seeming illogicality in his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not. If the hon. Gentleman wants to table an amendment to lower the threshold in order to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
hurry matters along, I shall consider it carefully. Our judgment is that 10 per cent, is about right and is reasonable but it can be no more than a judgment. We could have endless and fruitless arguments about the most appropriate level. We had to identify the point at which responsibilities could pass from LEAs to the funding agency and 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, were thought about right but I do not want to fall out with the hon. Gentleman on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. If the Minister is right and there is a planning vacuum when there is no funding agency nor a sufficient number of schools involved, the Committee could not allow that situation to continue. The Minister must make it clear how, below the 10 per cent, level, the Secretary of State and the LEAs, both of whom have responsibilities for planning school provision, between them will manage that planning vacuum. If they can do so below the 10 per cent, level, the Minister must justify it at that level. I accept that there is no magic in precisely 10 per cent., but how will planning be achieved below that level and why is the mechanism necessary above 10 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because our view is that when 90 per cent, of the provision remains with the LEA, it is likely to be able to provide for most contingencies. Up to that point, a small number of schools that have balloted to become grant maintained can be accommodated. Once the number goes beyond the 10 per cent, level, planning is needed and the more formal planning mechanisms that are available through the funding agency for schools will be introduced. Until that point, the Secretary of State—I do not want to upset or excite Opposition Members—obviously has an important responsibility, which he will continue to discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cross-over between the continuing adequacy of the 90 per cent, provision through the LEA and the point at which we must invoke a new mechanism for the grant-maintained sector is a matter of judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that he said earlier that the funding agency for schools was needed because the grant-maintained sector was unplanned? Does he agree that, until recently, grant-maintained schools were part of a planned system of locally provided education? Surely the only unplanned element in the grant-maintained sector is when the schools are threatened with closure because there are surplus places and the local authority wants to reorganise them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Any number of local variations, such as new housebuilding and so on, would affect the future development of the different sectors. We must try to take account of those changes in the most effective way. Our judgment is that when 90 per cent, of the provision continues to be in the LEA-maintained sector, the Bill will cater for it, given the Secretary of State's existing ultimate fallback powers. We want to be able to provide a proper, structured strategic planning role at some point for the growing grant-maintained sector, which will differ in every LEA—that is my problem with the 1,500 schools trigger point—to bring in what we hope will be the co-operative mechanism in the parallel regime that the Bill will introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me for returning to a point that I made earlier and to the question

of flexibility in determining the trigger point. In the chapter on Wales in the White Paper the intention seems clear. It states:
	<br><q><p>"It is important, however, that there should be flexibility in applying these trigger points so that they can be adapted to meet different circumstances in different areas in Wales. It is proposed, therefore, that the Secretary of State should have the power to specify different trigger points in both primary and secondary sectors and in different LEA areas, subject to consultation with the schools and LEAs concerned."</p></q>
We were anticipating that that would find expression in the wording of the Bill, but it has not. Can the Minister assure me that the Secretary of State for Wales will be flexible, and that he may decide, on occasions, not to trigger the funding council's entry until well past the 10 per cent, point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. Between the White Paper and the Bill, the Secretary of State for Wales was persuaded that the judgment inherent in the 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, figures was sound. Although the discretionary element that I ascribed to the Secretary of State for Education will also be available to the Secretary of State for Wales around the margins of the 10 per cent., I would not want to give the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North the impression that there will be wide discretion and that the Secretary of State for Wales might want to ignore the trigger point altogether. It would be wrong of me to do so, as clause 7 applies equally to Wales and to England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister's opposition to the 1,500 threshold places more to do with the fact that the Government are already in the process of revising downwards the estimate of the number of grant-maintained schools that there will be by April 1994? The White Paper refers to 1,500 schools being established by April 1994. For that to happen, they would have to be approved by January 1994. In the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the other place at column 618, Baroness Blatch spoke of 1,500 grant-maintained schools being approved by April 1994. Clearly, that represents a difference of several hundred schools. Which is it—1,500 schools established or 1,500 schools approved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term of art that we are using is to say that we anticipate. The figures can be only projections. I hope that the Opposition will not get too hung up on them. We are not. We believe that there are likely to be 1,500 schools operating and approved by that date. [HON. MEMBERS: "Which date?"] By April 1994. Our recent experience is encouraging. The rate of balloting is accelerating. The recent evidence suggests that the number is likely to increase.

I assure the Committee that I am not prepared to go to the stake over the matter. Those are projection figures. They may, in the end, be inaccurate one way or the other. I suspect that they may turn out to be over-modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I rephrase the Minister's answer? The figures are an estimate, which is designed to encourage schools to opt out. That is why he is so over-generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
Welsh Office will reply to our points. The Minister said a few moments ago that between July of this year and now the Secretary of State for Wales was persuaded to change his mind about the trigger mechanism operating in Wales. I do not believe a word of it. I believe that the Secretary of State for Wales changed his mind because, at the same time as the Bill was being drafted, proposals for the reorganisation of local government in Wales were being constructed. The difference is obvious. Currently there are eight local education authorities in the Principality. We are told, by leak or fact, that under the new dispensation there are likely to be about 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that if the move towards grant-maintained status is as slow as it is in Wales, the chances of 10 per cent, of schools under one of the eight local authorities having grant-maintained status are much less than they would be if there were 25 local authorities. Only three schools in Wales have opted out. Their positions would not be altered. There would be no trigger mechanism if there were eight local education authorities, but it is possible if there were smaller education authorities. The recipe for chaos in smaller local authorities is unbelievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A possible example is if my district council were to become a unitary local education authority. There are five state secondary schools, one Welsh-medium secondary school and one Roman Catholic secondary school. If the Welsh-medium school and the Roman Catholic school decided to opt out and were governed by the funding council for Wales, the country-wide provision of Welsh-medium and Catholic education would be thrown into confusion. Similarly, if one of the five secondary state schools in the new unitary authority of Torfaen were to become grant maintained, the funding council would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That change of mind, which has occurred in six months, is a result of consultations in England. It goes against the grain of the work that local education authorities and the Welsh Office have jointly undertaken over many years. The local education authority of Gwynedd—the Minister's local education authority—which is not Labour-controlled, has decisively rejected the idea behind the so-called trigger mechanism and the funding council in Gwynedd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trigger mechanism also has serious implications for Welsh-medium education in Wales. I hope that when the Minister of State responds to my comments, he will say how Welsh-medium education, particularly in rural areas, will be safeguarded if the figure of 10 per cent. is retained. The reason why the White Paper was right and the Bill is wrong, is that flexibility is necessary. There are huge differences within the small country of Wales in educational provision and need. I assumed that the White Paper made different provision for Wales because of Welsh-medium education and rural education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales—not the Minister of State, I hope—has suddenly realised that 25 unitary and smaller local education authorities would give the funding council a chance to operate. It is a bit shifty. I do not think that people involved in education in Wales will like it. I should be grateful for the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is considerable danger that the unco-ordinated efforts of the funding agency, the Secretary of State, the governing bodies and the local education authority will highlight the tension between local self-interest and the broader long-term planning of education provision. Such a tension will not be in the interests of pupils, parents and staff in my constituency and, I suspect, throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's proposals will reduce and remove the influence of the local education authority. A local education authority and the funding agency for schools will share responsibilities when more than 10 per cent, of local pupils are in grant-maintained schools. That will result in absolute chaos. I said that on Second Reading, and I have had no reason to change my mind. No single body will be in charge, yet earlier the Minister said—I do not know whether he was joking—that both bodies would have the same responsibilities and that both would be in charge. If that is so, it will create incredible confusion and chaos in certain areas. However, the local authority will continue to bear the political consequences of the confusion, uncertainty and conflict that will be the likely result of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is no accident. The Government have failed to resource education properly. They dictate education policy from the centre and sow the seeds of discord at local level, each time seeking to blame local authorities for the inadequacies of our educational system. Furthermore, the Government's ideological bias towards grant-maintained schools, and thereby towards the funding agency, in combination with the increase in powers given to the Secretary of State by these proposals are a recipe for political favouritism and interference by central Government in a process that should be the subject of local democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the funding agency, the Secretary of State will be in a position to push certain schools to seek grant-maintained status or to favour grant-maintained schools differentially at the expense of local education authority schools in considering proposals to rationalise school places. Such interference by the Secretary of State will result in the supply of school places being subject to criteria which are not of an educational nature. That will not be in the interests of pupils, parents, schools, local communities or the wider society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once in place, when grant-maintained pupils total above 75 per cent, of local provision, the undemocratic funding agency will assume responsibility for the provision of school places. These proposals replace a national education system—locally administered and accountable —with a fragmented system, nationally administered. The result will be the confusion and chaos that I have described.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
I shall quote from an article in 	<i>The Observer</i> written when the White Paper was first published. The article was written by Barry Hugill and states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State for Education has taken it upon himself to institute the most far-reaching blueprint for schools since R. A. Butler's famous Act of 1944. It took 'Rab' the best part of four years to prepare his legislation; Mr. Patten has managed it in three months. The Butler Act served for nearly half a century; The Patten version will be lucky to survive five years.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The main reason why the Education Act is needed is that parents in their hundreds of thousands have refused to do what Mr. Kenneth Baker, the last but one pretender to Butler's crown, decreed they should do in his 1988 Education Act".</p></q>
That sums up the argument. Parents have refused to follow the Government's suggestion that they opt out. The Bill has been introduced not to raise educational standards but to encourage schools eventually to opt out of the state sector. The Bill deals with the present state education system, irrespective of schools' status. Any Education Bill should aim to improve educational standards. In order to achieve that, there should be minimum standards of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that you are about to rise to call me to order, Mr. Martin, but what I have said is relevant to the amendment. These things have to be said before one can argue for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that class sizes are rising. The Bill should set maximum class sizes and minimum levels of resourcing, and provide adequate and safe school buildings. Government edicts already impose undue control over expenditure by means of the discredited standard spending assessment arrangements and capping mechanisms. No matter what the Government say, parents and teachers know that class sizes are increasing, buildings are crumbling and that there is a shortage of books and equipment. Parents spend many hours raising funds for basic equipment for schools. The Government have already ensured inequality of provision by interfering with LEA budgets, and now they propose to introduce a mechanism to perpetuate and extend that inequality by creating non-accountable funding authorities, even when only a tiny minority of schools—less than 400—have achieved grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment—I know that you have been waiting for this, Mr. Martin—would give the arrangements much more credibility by ensuring that the number of grant-maintained schools is more significant before the funding authority arrangements are triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would expect the Minister to have no hesitation in accepting the amendment. The figure of 1,500 schools represents a low proportion of the number of schools throughout the country; it is a very low trigger point. If the Minister had confidence in the Bill, which he and his colleagues drafted, he would be extremely confident that 1,500 schools will soon have grant-maintained status. Baroness Blatch recently stated in the other place that 1,500 schools would have grant-maintained status by 1994. If he believed that—I am sure that he does—it would be petty of him not to accept the amendment. If he were not to accept the amendment, it would suggest that he does not have confidence that 1,500 schools will, quickly, achieve grant-maintained status. The figure of 1,500 schools is not a high proportion of the total number of schools.

Many education authority areas contain no grant-maintained schools at all, and frankly, there seems to be no great push toward grant-maintained status. Many schools do not seem to be rushing toward seeking grant-maintained status—as we were told that they would after the general election. In my region of the north of England, which includes Cumbria, Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland, North Yorkshire and the five metropolitan Tyne and Wear districts, only one of those authorities— Cumbria—has shown interest in grant-maintained schools. If one studies the record of Cumbria and some of the things that have happened in Cumbria recently, one can perhaps understand why a few schools wish to seek grant-maintained status. The vast majority of LEAs in the north have not witnessed any serious effort by their schools to become grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other local authorities in the north-east—in Gateshead, Newcastle, north Tyneside, Cleveland and North Yorkshire—have held numerous ballots. Every one of those ballots has been unsuccessful, and no school has achieved grant-maintained status, yet the Government continue to try to sell what I would describe as their rotten goods. Surely, it is reasonable to require wider acceptance of grant-maintained status before the funding agency or funding authority is allowed to be involved in resourcing arrangements for schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the hon.

What was the attitude of the LEAs to each of those ballots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The LEAs were hostile to the idea of grant-maintained schools—and naturally so—because they are giving a first-class service to their children. There is no need for grant-maintained status, there is no need for funding authorities, there is no need for funding agencies. The parents have shown that they have confidence in LEAs by turning down every single ballot on grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is a case of cause and effect? If the LEAs are hostile—the hon.

One of the things that I applaud about the Bill is that it will make it be much more difficult for LEAs to adopt the hostile posture that the hon. Gentleman appears to applaud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says how good the LEAs are in the north-east.

The LEAs put forward their arguments about why schools should remain within their LEAs and the parents accepted them. Those LEAs in favour of the grant-maintained sector put forward their arguments and they lost. I have a letter that has nothing to do with my LEA or with my region, but which is from Manchester city council in response to a letter from Mr. Forrester of the Department of Education. He is not here this morning; he usually passes little notes but perhaps he has a morning off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DFE sent a letter to the chief education officers of all the LEAs in England. It is a disgraceful letter, which I shall not read out because it is far too long [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh, go on."] I could read it out, but I shall leave it on file.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manchester city council is deeply annoyed at the allegations that Mr. Forrester made in his letter. He alleges that LEAs prevent schools from achieving grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has cited a letter that bears the name of one of my officials.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that helpful intervention. The Government regard hostility to grant-maintained schools as a crime, but LEAs have a right to campaign against grant-maintained schools. Those LEAs have provided an excellent educational service to ratepayers for more than 50 years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hardly surprising that the views of LEAs correspond with those of parents, because parents are part of the general populace and they take part in the democratic process of electing councillors.

The fact that LEAs are trying to protect their services adds balance to the decisions that schools and parents are having to make. If LEAs did not so actively campaign to keep schools within their control, people would be making decisions on the basis of the Government's propaganda. Will my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an excellent intervention by my hon. Friend. Her analysis is correct. There is no need to ask the Minister what he thinks of LEAs and local government. We all know that he is hostile to LEAs.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is reasonable to require a wider acceptance of grant-maintained status before the funding authority is allowed to be involved in the resourcing arrangements for schools. Grant-Maintained Schools Ltd said that 2,000 schools will opt out immediately after the Conservative party's general election victory. The previous Secretary of State said that there would be an avalanche of schools requesting grant-maintained status. The amendment would not require 2,000 schools or an avalanche of schools to opt out; it would require only 1,500 schools and I think that the case rests there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7 allows responsibility to be passed to the funding agency for schools. Many of the Minister's arguments against the amendment lack logic. I am not sure that the case has been made for the introduction of the funding agency for schools per se. I am unconvinced that it is necessary. The amendment proposes a more reasonable trigger than the 10 per cent, level proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has not been made for the introduction of the funding agency. The current mechanism used to recycle local authority moneys into grant-maintained schools is simple and straightforward. The Department for Education bills the LEA for the grant-maintained schools in its area. That bill is based on the local management of schools funding formula plus approximately 15 per cent, for added-on costs. The Department sends that money to the grant-maintained schools. Another mechanism enables the Government to deduct money at source from the grants to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no difficulty in those arrangements continuing until at least 1,500 schools have become grant maintained.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
The Government's reason for introducing the funding agency for schools, is a strategic one: to plan the provision of school places in a given area. I shall come back to that and its place in the Bill later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we place on record that if the clause is enacted as drafted it will be a recipe for chaos in local education provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said, we have a national system operated locally. The clause will give the funding agency for schools a statutory responsibility to provide sufficient places for education in a given locality. When that responsibility is triggered, at 10 per cent., two authorities, will be given parallel, but not shared, responsibilities. That means that two authorities will act independently to provide school places in any given area. That is a recipe for chaos; a bureaucratic nightmare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will pay the cost of establishing the funding agency when the trigger point is reached? We were told that the Secretary of State was the author of the White Paper, which states on page 57, paragraph 13.14:
	<br><q><p>"The only significant additional expenditure will be on the establishment and operation of the Funding Agency. It will have an important, but carefully circumscribed, role. Its costs are therefore expected to be modest, and that will be more than offsetting savings in local authority administration and DFE manpower costs as the number of GM schools grow."</p></q>
According to the White Paper, the establishment of the funding agency will have little impact, yet it is an additional arm of bureaucracy. When the funding agency is set up, at 10 per cent, trigger—or when 1,500 schools are grant-maintained, if the amendment is accepted—its centralised bureaucracy will be engaged in the provision of sufficient educational places alongside a locally elected LEA, which will be given the same statutory responsibility to meet educational needs in its locality. Where will the necessary additional finance come from?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wrote to me on 13 November on that issue and said that, by and large, the system in force now will continue to apply. His letter stated that council taxpayers' money will still be used for the provision of local education services. However, when the 75 per cent, trigger is reached and the funding agency becomes the sole responsible instrument for the provision of places, it will use council taxpayers' money to help to provide local education services. Where will accountability lie? Will the local taxpayers be consulted about the efficient use of their money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the funding agency for schools will have a strategic role when new schools are created once the 10 per cent, trigger has been reached. Is it right that a funding agency, a non-departmental public body, charged under the guidelines with carrying out a central Government activity, should be involved in something that is the statutory responsibility of the local authority under the Education Act 1944?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred earlier to new school places that will meet needs arising from house building. A new town area such as that in Warrington, in my constituency, has an expanding population and therefore an increasing need for new schools. For the past 20 years, those needs have been met. In the Bill, however, when the trigger point is reached, two agencies acting independently will propose schemes to meet the needs of a particular area. Any proposal will be dealt with through arbitration by the Secretary of State for Education. He has said that he would act in an even-handed and impartial manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
The White Paper, under the authorship of the Secretary of State, states in page 19, paragraph 3.4:
	<br><q><p>"It is right that the route to GM status should remain the parental ballot. However, the Government firmly believes that self-government is best for state schools and remains fully committed to the advancement of this end."</p></q>
That paragraph includes two points: First, the Secretary of State has already declared that he is not impartial, but has a committed view on grant-maintained status. Secondly, he believes that a parental ballot should lead to grant-maintained status. Where would the parental ballot for the creation of new schools be held? Is the Minister saying that those schools will be created without parental ballot when their strategic needs come to be met?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which proposes the introduction of a trigger point of 1,500 schools, is a most reasonable measure, given the considerable opposition to the funding agency for schools. I hope that the Minister will accept our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with some of the points relating to Wales, and specifically those raised by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). First, let me assure him that the Government's change of heart on the issue of flexibility between the White Paper and the Bill had nothing to do with our proposed reorganisation of local government in Wales. If the hon. Gentleman needs proof, let me remind him that the proposal for 23 unitary authorities was put forward as far back as March, while the White Paper was published in July. We were fully aware of the possibility of changes in the structure of local government when the White Paper was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper has dealt with the issue of flexibility. We were especially concerned, because of LEAs, about flexibility at the 75 per cent, trigger point. That document states:
	<br><q><p>"It is also proposed that an LEA should be able to request the Secretary of State to relieve it of those duties once more than 10 per cent, of pupils are in GM schools".</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Schools and I had further discussions about trigger points. I concluded that there was sufficient flexibility at both the 10 and the 75 per cent, points because of the nature of the clause, because it is permissive for the Secretary of State, and not obligatory. We shall consider the circumstances in each LEA as they arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As said on clause 2, it is difficult to predict how matters will develop. I made it clear then that where the schools funding council for wales shares with LEAs responsibility to secure sufficient school places, there will be provision for Welsh-medium education. If an order is made under clause 7 and there is shared responsibility between the SFC and the LEA to provide sufficient places, that duty incorporates provision of Welsh-medium education. Therefore the SFC for Wales has an obligation to provide Welsh-medium education in the grant-maintained sector. This has become something of a bogey among some LEAs, possibly because we do not yet have a Welsh-medium graint-maintained school, but there is no reason why we should not have one. It is well known to those members of the Committee who represent Wales that at least one school, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North, is considering such a proposal. I assure the Committee that there is no threat whatsoever to Welsh-medium schools in any of the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Government are deliberately over-optimistic in their estimates of the number of schools that will opt out. If the Minister is convinced that his estimates are correct, or nearly correct, he should have no difficulty in accepting the amendment. The earliest date by which he is likely to be able to establish the funding agency for schools will coincide almost exactly with the date by which he estimates that 1,500 schools will have opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are misusing statements to further the cause of grant-maintained schools. I refer to a Department for Education press release, 371/92, which was headed
	<br><q><p>"Sevenfold increase in ballots for grant maintained schools".</p></q>
It states that around 100 ballots were held in October. The true figure was 95. The press release says that that was a sevenfold increase over the previous year. In fact, there were 15 ballots in October 1991, so the number has increased just over six times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Six and a half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Six and a third. If one rounds that, it becomes six, not seven. I am not sure what that says about the Government's promotion of high standards in schools. When I was at school, if I had said that 95 divided by 15 was seven, not six and a third, I would have been severely reprimanded. That blows open the Government's hypocrisy about promoting high standards, when they are so sloppy in their own statistics. The headline should have referred to a sixfold increase. I hope that that will be taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of the 95 ballots held in October were 75 yes votes and 20 no votes, which represents a 21 per cent, rejection rate. In the previous October there were 14 yes votes and one no vote. That is a 7 per cent, rejection rate. The figures therefore show a threefold increase in rejection rates. The Government did not publicise that, but it is worth noting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said, and the Minister has just confirmed, that they wanted 1,500 grant-maintained schools by April 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the cause of accuracy, the Government have not said that we want 1,500 schools, but that we project that there are likely to be 1,500 schools. That is an entirely different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that inflection in the Minister's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments must be able to plan, for financial reasons and to determine the division of responsibilities between LEAs and funding authorities. They estimate that there will be 1,500 grant-maintained schools by April 1994, and that most of the 3,900 secondary schools will have opted out by 1996. To make that a realistic target, the Government would require 1,000 additional yes votes by December 1993. So far, the ratio of yes to no votes has been about 3:1—that is, there has been one no vote for every three yes votes. In addition, the Minister has rejected about 13 per cent, of those yes votes. Forecasts are made by examining past figures and projecting them into the future to come up with a sensible figure for the number of ballots that would need to be held to achieve the Government's target of 3,900 grant-maintained schools by 1996. Using the figures that I have described, the Government would need 1,530 ballots to produce 1,000
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
approved yes results. The 100 ballots still due this term will bring the total to 260. There would have to be a further 1,430 in the following three terms. That is a massive increase to an average of 480 ballots per term, compared with 260 this term. That is an ambitious and almost impossible target. I should be interested to know how the statistics have been calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the uneven pattern of opt-out schools, the figures become even more unlikely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the implication of the hon. Lady's remarks that the amendment would mean that the funding agency for schools could not come into operation for some considerable time after April 1994?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conclusion that I have reached is that the Government are being inconsistent in opposing the amendment and in their forecast targets. I am curious to know whether the Government are being deliberately misleading, or whether the statisticians who calculated the estimates have been incompetent. The Committee deserves an explanation as to why the figures are so wildly inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An examination of the pattern of the way in which local education authorities and the schools within them, have opted out shows that most such decisions are concentrated in a very few authorities. Only 28 local education authorities out of 109 have more than three opted-out secondary schools. Without a major breakthrough in those areas where fewer than 10 per cent, of secondary schools have voted to opt out, the Government's estimates will be impossible to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the proposition that the problem has nothing to do with the incompetence of statisticians, but everything to do with Government interference as a result of the cloud cuckoo land expectations of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend expresses it very well. I think that cloud cuckoo land is far more likely than statistical incompetence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for the funding of grant-maintained schools by the Department for Education were given in the autumn statement, when it was said that £157 million would be made available for 1993–94. What will happen to that money if grant-maintained schools do not materialise? Grants for education support and training for the 1993–94 financial year have been reduced by £35 million —about 10 per cent.—because of the Government's expectation of the number of grant-maintained schools that will be created in the next financial year. Yet that figure is far in excess of what might have been expected even if there were 1,500 grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole matter is riddled with inconsistency and we deserve a better explanation that has been given so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start with the 1,500 schools. That ensures that I do not stray from the amendment. I shall place the figure in context. A specific figure is not the important point. The Minister was naive when he mentioned 1,499 schools. The Opposition would not deploy such an argument, but I accept that it is reasonable for the Minister to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We included the figure in the amendment because local education authorities and funding authorities will work in tandem for a long time even after the 10 per cent, and 75
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
per cent, figures are reached. Anxieties exist about how the LEAs and the funding authorities will co-operate fruitfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider LEAs. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth mentioned hostile local education authorities. We should consider the Government's hostility to local education authorities. That is equally important. We have included the figure of 1,500 schools in the amendment to ensure that there is a sensible long-term analysis is of how the LEAs and funding authorities work together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow that remark to pass. The Government have not been hostile to local euducation authorities. I was a member of a LEA before I became a Member of Parliament. I have always supported the excellent work of LEAs. However, the hon. Member for Hemsworth is a sensible man and will recognise that change occurs. LEAs have existed for 100 years. The LEA is not the only vehicle capable of delivering good education to the nation's children. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State presents an alternative in the Bill, so that parents have more choice. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take account of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it is another example of Government exaggeration for their special causes and dogmatism. Local education authorities have not existed for more than 100 years. They have existed for 90 years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the main thrust of the argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us return to the main thrust of the argument as the hon. Gentleman admits that he is wrong about the subordinate point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is an unjustified attack on local education authorities. Without local education authorities, which work in partnership with central Government, many Government reforms would not have been implemented. Many LEAs are Labour-controlled. Although LEAs have sometimes been hostile towards the Government, they have all shown that they will work closely with the Government when measures become law. LEAs miraculously effect reforms that are excessively difficult to implement, sometimes on minimum money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: LEAs, even Birmingham, should be congratulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not mention Birmingham. The Opposition's view of the Government's attitude to local education authorities is paranoid. The argument of the hon. Members for Hemsworth and for City of Durham in favour of LEAs is that in every school for which LEAs are responsible, the best possible standards are produced, even when parents believe that grant-maintained status for a school would improve standards for their children. The Opposition are thus trying to deprive parents of a choice that they believe will improve standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent article in 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> highlighted the differences in value-added between schools in the same Liberal-controlled education authority. Professor Nuffield of London university said that
	<br><q><p>"there are still very substantial differences between schools. We have to close the performance gap."</p></q>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
The hon. Gentleman's argument is predicated on the belief that every LEA produces the best possible results for the children in every school. If that is not so, he must give parents the opportunity to do something about it by choosing grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. After that brief intervention perhaps we can deal with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) for that extraordinary outburst. He has obviously been building up spleen for a long time and now he has given vent to it. That is wonderful. He may call us paranoid, but if ever there was an example of paranoia, that was it. The hon. Gentleman quoted 	<i>The Sunday Times.</i> I no longer take that newspaper because it is the most inaccurate newspaper currently printed; it is full of trash and tripe, either about the Chancellor's Access card or Princess Diana. I do not hold with such trivia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first reply to the hon. Gentleman's speech, in the context of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, LEAs are not perfect creatures; no one suggests that for one moment. My hon. Friend, or rather the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth—he may be my friend, I know not, but he will come over to our party eventually. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Well, perhaps he cannot join just yet; he has to show true repentance. The hon. Gentleman believes, as I do, in original sin. We know that no human institution is perfect. The Minister may approach perfection, but no one else on earth does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities are weaker than others, and weak LEAs will have to work with funding and grant-aiding bodies about which we know nothing. We know nothing about their quality. All we know is that the powers that the Bill gives them do not include some of the powers currently held by LEAs, such as those relating to the provision of places and suitable education according to age, ability and aptitude. That was central to the Education Act 1944 but is completely missing in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs are not empowered but enjoined to develop the spiritual, moral, mental and physical welfare of children in their schools. The Minister does not refer to that. When he defined the funding agencies he said that they would be little more than accountants. That will present a problem if they are to work in conjunction with LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are asking is that, for once, the Government take their time. They should let grant-maintained schools settle down and then decide how to marry the funding agencies with the LEAs so that the infinite wisdom of LEAs is not lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate at the beginning of this important part of the Bill. Some of the Minister's remarks were informative, if not always convincing. He gave us interesting ideas—leaving aside his comments on our alleged obsession with what he regards as "the small matter" of the Bill giving more power to the Secretary of State. He dismisses that as insignificant. I remind him that the Secretary of State himself told us that the Bill would give him 44 new powers. I think that he will eventually have even more. That is hardly insignificant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One interesting point emerged from the Minister's remarks. He said that the 10 per cent, trigger point will not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
be automatic and that there will be circumstances in which, if 10 per cent, of schols are established in an area, it does not necessarily follow that the clause will be activated. That is useful, and right, but it raises many other issues that we shall have to pursue on later amendments. It is a step forward, but it opens up a new range of points on which we shall require information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not go into detail about the time scale of the operation of clause 7. Had he done so, we might have been able to see whether his ideas about that fitted in with his thoughts on when 1,500 grant-maintained schools would be in place. The simple logic is that it is inevitable that, even if the Minister establishes powers under clause 7 early, they could not be used until the financial year 1994–95. It is too late for them to be in force by next year. Yet that is the date by which Ministers expect to achieve 1,500 grant-maintained schools. I do not see why our amendment would conflict with their aims if, indeed, they are confident that that would be the outcome of the grant-maintained campaign. His other remarks confirm our worst fears about the implementation of the clause. The Minister again talked of the parallel powers of the funding authority and the local education authority. This implies that the funding authority and the LEA will move in the same direction, but cuts in surplus places may cause tension and conflict and, under the Minister's plans there will be no lead authority or overall strategic planning. This will not lead to best use of resources or to the most appropriate provision of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that in any dispute between the funding authority and the LEA, there, on his white charger, will be the impartial Secretary of State for Education. This does not quite fit with all that the Minister has told us previously. He has said that with capital allocation, Ministers will be prejudiced in favour of grant-maintained schools. Where this wonderful new impartiality is to come from remains unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first debate on an amendment to clause 7 and, as I said earlier, we need to consider it in more detail because it is so important. If the Minister will not accept that the clause should not be triggered until 1,500 grant-maintained schools have been established, it will show that he is not confident that there will be 1,500 grant-maintained schools in the projected time scale. It is worth testing that principle and I urge the Committee to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a paradox at the heart of the Bill; the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
Government insist that about 1·5 million surplus places need to be removed from the school system, but they also say that the Bill will extend parental choice. We have difficulty reconciling the Government's political objectives. How can 1·5 million surplus places be removed and parental choice be extended at the same time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, it is impossible for the Bill to achieve those two aims. The amendments would ensure that the Bill would properly reflect the need for an efficient education system. As a result of Government neglect, an ever-decreasing share of national wealth is devoted to the education service. Therefore, it is imperative that the limited resources available for the education service are used efficiently, in the best interests of our children. We need a system that can respond to parental choice. Opposition Members believe that the Bill, rather than extending parental choice, will reduce it. The amendments expose those deficiencies in the Bill.
