<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 519, in page 16, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Any liability of a local authority excluded by virtue of subsection 3(b) and 3(c) above from transfer to the governing body shall on the date of the implementation of the proposals be transferred to the funding authority.'.—[<i>Mr. Don Foster.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 30 would transfer liabilities from the local authority to the funding agency when schools opt out of local authority control. This morning I stressed that two important points must be tackled. I was halfway through my explanation of the first, which is simply that a clear public statement should be made of the cost of the grant-maintained sector to Britain's taxpayers. By concealing debt charges and by allowing the costs of premature retirement to remain with the local authority, the Government will provide a hidden subsidy for the grant-maintained sector. Many Opposition Members find that unacceptable.<br><br>
The second argument is more complicated, in that we must enter the Alice-in-Wonderland world of local government finance in more detail than we have so far. It concerns the way in which the Government calculate debt and the restrictions placed on local authorities over the use of capital receipts to help capital projects in their areas. All hon. Members know that, until recently, there was what amounted to a clamp down by the Treasury on the use of those receipts, which could be used only for the redemption of debt. The autumn statement changed that. For a one-year period, local authorities will have the opportunity to use capital receipts for capital projects. That period is due to end in April 1994, when capital receipts will no longer be available for new projects.<br><br>
Because the use of capital receipts is linked to the total amount of debt held by a local authority, reduction of that debt through the transfer of liability from the local authority to the funding agency would give a true reflection of spending on the grant-maintained sector and would liberate some of the capital money that would no longer be tied up in debt redemption. Such a reduction would allow the possibility of freeing some of local authorities' capital receipts.<br><br>
Of course, the sums are notional, rather than real, but that proposal would be of great assistance to many local authorities. I hope that the Minister will consider it. Local government finance is a difficult subject. There are many experts but few certainties. However, there may be considerable benefit in reducing local authority debt in that way and transferring it to the funding agency.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 808</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to this important amendment, and shall begin by explaining the reason for my interest. Cambridgeshire county council was involved in extensive building plans for the Cambridge regional college, which comes under the Further Education Funding Council, as it is not a school. I shall tell the Committee what happened to show the kind of difficulty that might arise unless the legislation relating to schools is changed.<br><br>
In about 1987, Cambridgeshire county council agreed to relocate the regional college which at present is housed on about eight or nine sites scattered around Cambridge on to one site on the north side of the city. It is an expensive project, totalling some £30 million at 1987 prices, one of the major projects in the pipeline and has been approved by Government.<br><br>
One way in which Cambridgeshire county council hoped to recoup some of its costs was selling some of the sites on which the college is currently located. The scheme went through the education committee and the county council and, as I said, it was approved by Government. Plans went ahead for the first phase of the building programme to proceed.<br><br>
In the meantime, the Government announced their plans for the further education colleges to be taken out of local authority control. At that stage, the county council started to have severe worries about what the Education Assets Board would decide about the college's assets. Once building had begun, not only the new site, but the eight or nine existing sites could have been transferred with the college, thereby denying the LEA the possibility of selling some of those sites later to recoup its debts. The local authority which, I remind the Committee, is Conservative controlled, was so worried about it that it delayed the start of the building programme for a good 18 months until the previous Secretary of State for Education managed to sort out the problem.<br><br>
I have described what happened at length because the problem could occur in the schools sector. It is easy to understand the local authority's reluctance to get involved in the issue. It did dnot want to be saddled with a large debt, unable to pay it off, with no assets to dispose of at the end of the day. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that point when he replies to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Tim Boswell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that this was not an issue in which there were grey areas to consider. In a sense, he is right—either debt is transferred or it is not. However, my experience of privatisation legislation is that it is extremely difficult to attribute particular slugs of debt to particular kinds of capital spend, especially when the different interests which may or may not apply to an existing education institution or school may themselves be somewhat uncertain.<br><br>
If the Opposition were, collectively, to apply the passion with which they spoke this morning on the division of assets to this afternoon's consideration of how the debt is to be apportioned, there could be some major practical problems. In fairness, the hon. Member for Bath and the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) acknowledged some of the potential problems. My hon. Friend is feeling his way round those difficulties. For the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0554">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 809</span>
Committee to try to "hunt the debt", to assign it to particular schools and then to make some compensating transfer to them, would be a major, but fruitless exercise.<br><br>
Local authorities may be worried that they will be saddled with a debt for which the assets are no longer under their control. Their standard spending assessment will take into account the servicing of that debt. The hon. Member for Wallsend tried, manfully and ingeniously, to convert the debate into a debate on the Department of the Environment, but I am reluctant to follow him in extenso down that path, although I am tempted. We could debate all night the appropriateness of SSAs, but if we were to do so, Mr. Martin, you would not merely shuffle in your chair, but would rise to your feet and bring us to order. We could similarly debate the impact of the capital receipt regime. It was a pity that the hon. Member for Wallsend did not acknowledge that, even under the old and more restrictive regime, which was relaxed this year, it was always possible to spend 25 per cent. of the capital receipts per annum, so there was some flexibility. But we do not want to get into the general and technical issues of local authority spending and the philosophy and doctrine behind it.<br><br>
I shall dispose of the short and eloquent contribution by the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). She gave a practical example of the problem that worries people. I am not trying to put her down, but the particular case that she mentioned related to previous legislation—the Education Reform Act. She is concerned that that problem might arise under this Bill. I hope that we have anticipated that by the amendments on exclusion clauses that I moved and convinced the Committee of this morning. They were designed to achieve a proper understanding of and make a sensible allowance for such matters. I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured that the Bill deals with the difficulties that her local authority has experienced.<br><br>
There would be some conceptual difficulty in pegging debt to an individual school. We should acknowledge that that would be the case whether or not the school opted for grant-maintained status. No one in the Committee has proposed that the same exercise should be applied to LEA schools, although a debt burden could be assigned to them which could be matched by an increase in grant. That might involve a certain management principle.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wallsend suggested in his interesting contribution that it might be possible to have a shadow debt and to transfer that to the grant-maintained sector. That might be a management tool, but I think that it would still give rise to the conceptual problems of unpicking local authority debt, which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, is aggregated. It would be difficult to do whether the school was grant-maintained or maintained. It might involve interests that have nothing to do with education.<br><br>
The valiant attempt by the hon. Member for Bath to put the debt aside and transfer the global debt to the funding authority would create two problems. First, it would not remove the problem of working out the debt to be transferred. Secondly, under the Bill the funding authority for schools is not to borrow—even if its funding could be increased accordingly. I remember earlier exchanges with the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 810</span>
Taylor)—who is temporarily out of the Room—on the Bill that introduced privatisation of water. I assure the Committee that we do not wish to follow that route because we do not want funding authorities to be borrowing authorities.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an important difference there. I apologise for not being very aware of the details of legislation on the privatisation of water. When a school becomes grant-maintained and it embarks on capital projects after approval from the Secretary of State, the funding will be produced by grants from central Government, rather than by giving the school borrowing powers. There will be no debt charge or servicing of the debt by the individual grant-maintained school because it will come out of a slice of money that is granted from central Government. The only servicing of a debt charge will be that incurred while it was previously under local authority sponsorship. We are trying to address that debt in the amendment. By one action, that debt could be transferred from the local authority sector to the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I have been attempting to explain the difficulties of unpicking what that debt might be. By a side wind, I pointed out that, at the moment, it is not proposed to impose the same disciplines on maintained schools, although it would be interesting if one did.<br><br>
Oddly enough, I think that the hon. Member for Bath put forward interesting and thought-provoking proposals, which might have a certain resonance in some quarters. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, for example, thinks about such things, which have been imposed in several other disciplines involving capital charging.<br><br>
It is difficult to unpick the past. Conceptually, it would be easier to do something in the future, although it is not an indication of anything more than a possibility—whether it would be desirable or not is another matter. The hon. Gentleman is right—grant-maintained schools will receive grants for their capital works in the future, just as the local authority will directly fund the capital works of schools in the maintained sector. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was moving towards saying that, one day, it would be good practice to bring about a situation in which all capital was charged for and then reclaimed. There may be a stronger case for that happening in the future.<br><br>
Tonight is not the time to produce such a situation. For a start, not only does it have practical ramifications, but it goes wider than this legislation and it affects the whole of local authority debt. I am not standing here hoping to reform the whole system, although I found the debate on it extremely interesting. I want a sensible basis on which grant-maintained schools may transfer. I am not convinced by the arguments that I have heard that there is a practical way to identify the debt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the Minister's point. Capital projects in schools that were planned five or 10 years ago by LEAs were based on the cost of the capital projects plus the debt charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should have tabled an amendment to confine the debt charge to a prior and identifiable one. The local authority is not a loser by this process, because, although it holds the debt, the debt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0555">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 811</span>
and its servicing are taken account of in the standard spending assessment. If the debt has already been incurred and is causing charges to the local authority, those are part of the considerations under which the SSA is determined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will agree that the fundamental funding arrangement for LEAs is by per head of school population. When the school population moves into the grant-maintained sector, that fundamental element of local education SSA moves with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that is not a full account.<br><br>
We have a fair formula for dealing with debt. The clause, as drafted, does not impact on local authorities by making their servicing of that debt more onerous. It is not intended to do so. It would cause endless difficulty and, probably considerable inequity, to move across to the schools—presumably with the necessary funds—inherited debt burdens. I have listened to the debate with care. That move would not be justified, effective or practical. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the Minister and I received the impression—I hope that Opposition Members agree—that the Minister's remarks showed some sympathy for our case.<br><br>
The Minister properly made the point that the identification of the debt to be allocated to an individual school or to a number of schools collectively within an LEA would be difficult to achieve. I acknowledged that earlier and it was also acknowledged by the hon. Member for Wallsend. The amendment does not set out the mechanism by which that would be done. The Minister was right to say that it would be difficult. However, I remind him that in other Government opting-out policies that is precisely the exercise that has been carried out.<br><br>
Earlier, I made specific reference to the national health service reforms, in which detailed calculations of the capital receipts, debt charges and other matters surrounding the transfer of assets are made. Mechanisms are available within the NHS reforms to carry out such calculations. At the present rate at which schools are becoming grant maintained, that would not be an especially difficult exercise because there is no evidence of the avalanche of schools moving to grant-maintained status that was predicted by Conservative Members. Even though I accept the Minister's argument, I believe that it would be possible to carry out the exercise in due course. The Minister said that it would not be appropriate to consider that issue tonight because of wider implications involving the Department of the Environment, but I hope that he is willing to reflect upon it and will return to it later.<br><br>
I hope that you will not rule me out of order Mr. Martin because I am responding to the Minister's points, but his remarks about SSAs will not be well received by many LEAs. For example, he said that there would be a fair formula for dealing with debt. My local authority, the county of Avon, will not be happy with the formula for debt that is to be used. If it is not a fair formula, it will have a bearing on other aspects of local authority control and, specifically, on education, which makes up 70 per cent. of the budget of most local authorities that contain LEAs. The servicing of debt charges is an important issue for LEAs and many of them are not happy with current arrangements. One of the arguments that the hon. Member for Wallsend used to support the amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 812</span>
was that the removal of debt charges from LEAs to place them into the hands of the funding authority would be of great benefit to the LEAs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made an interesting intervention in my earlier speech to say that he was surprised that we included reference to the debts that occur by payments for early retirement. I am sure that he is well aware that the usual procedure for early retirement is carried out within the efficient exercise procedures for LEAs. He will also be aware that that exercise is expensive in its first few years, but leads to benefits accruing later. Perhaps my response to his intervention was not effective. I tried to make the point that, having gone through an efficient exercise and paid high up-front costs as well as subsequent costs, LEAs will be dismayed if they do not have the continuing benefit of such an exercise. If the proposal in the clause is not amended, many LEAs may no longer opt for the efficient exercise procedure for fear that it will be a continuing burden that will not provide any benefit to them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wallsend made it clear that there are two key reasons for the amendments, the second of which—relating to capital debts—is important. I have discussed it, but concentrated on the first reason, which is crucial. We need a mechanism that reflects the cost of the grant-maintained sector and gives an impetus for those involved in that sector to examine the true costs of what they are providing. They are attempting to reduce such costs, particularly by shedding surplus places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander? If he wanted to impose those management disciplines on the grant-maintained sector, he should concede that similar and parallel disciplines should be imposed on the maintained sector and its capital spend as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention as I intended to discuss that issue.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the implementation of such changes in the NHS and said that they apply to individual health units. I said that I was not seeking for the change to be applied to individual schools, be they grant-maintained or LEA-controlled. The Minister, quite properly, said the same thing. The change should be applied to a sector. The Minister is right to ask if I believe that similar disciplines should apply to the LEA sector. Yes, indeed, they should. He will be aware that such reforms have been introduced only in the higher education sector. The universities are now required to specify their assets and any depreciation. Such reforms would be important and perhaps the Minister will bring forward proposals to facilitate them.<br><br>
Given the Minister's response, there is little point in pressing the amendment to a Division because there is scope to consider it in future. If the carrying out of debt calculation could be more precisely defined, we may persuade the Minister to support the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nice tie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like it to be recorded that the hon. Member with perhaps the most exotic taste in ties in the House has commented on mine. That is high praise indeed.<br><br>
The clause is important. It is one of the central clauses dealing with the terms and conditions of those who will be transferred with schools as they opt out—in other words, those who work in them.<br><br>
We want a debate on the transfer of staff and how that will happen because, so far, the history of such transfers in opted-out-schools has, in some cases, been alarming. I shall give the Committee examples of when staff were not given the protection that was envisaged under the Education Reform Act 1988. Moreover, they are not being given the protection to which, in other areas of law, the Government would claim that they are entitled.<br><br>
It might help the Committee if I mention several schools—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful if the hon.

It is important that the Committee should not be confused at the outset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am ever anxious to help the Minister. I hope that he, in turn, can help the Committee as his Secretary of State has not been willing to help one or two of the grant-maintained schools. If he will bear with me, I shall try to establish that important point.<br><br>
In an earlier sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) drew to the Committee's attention the Scotby Church of England primary school in Cumbria. That is a 200-pupil school. In a fearlessly frank article, the education correspondent of the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> Richard Garner—<i>[Interruption.</i>] he is an excellent journalist—said that that school was a flagship of the Government's opt-out crusade. After that school opted out, it quickly became clear that it was effectively crippled by a shortage of cash. As a result, two members of staff who had transferred and whose rights would, I hope, have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 814</span>
been protected were faced with redundancy. One was a teacher who went to a school down the road. The other was the school's 56-year-old head of cleaning, Mary Griffiths, who had put in nine years' service and obviously played a significant role in the school. Yet her reward was dismissal because of the cash shortages.<br><br>
The article points out that the row which those sackings has generated is a major embarrassment to the Secretary of State. Although he has consistently accused opponents of opting out of giving parents misleading information, he has remained dramatically quiet about the circumstances of this case. In response to the Minister's recent intervention, may I say that a Secretary of State who will not comment on what goes on in schools makes it difficult for us to be certain of the legal position? I hope that the hon. Gentleman can help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help only to the extent of saying that if there has been a breach of the law, it would be a poor day indeed if the Secretary of State were finally to determine that matter. If there is a breach of employment law, that is an appropriate matter for a tribunal and/or the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not surprise the hon. Gentleman to learn that the matter will be heard by the industrial tribunal. The General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union alleges that there was a breach either of the law or of the school's contractual obligations.<br><br>
There is an even more bizarre case concerning a school in Dorset. Woodroffe school became the first grant-maintained school to announce forced redundancies, going so far as to suspend the head teacher. It is a comprehensive school with 850 pupils, some of whom are boarders. The teachers at the school passed a vote of no confidence in the head teacher last September after the announcement of threatened redundancies, because by that time the school had already established a deficit of £100,000.<br><br>
Although it has become obvious that a clash of strong personalities took place, it is beyond doubt that the school had run into significant debt. There is considerable relevant documentation, including a letter which my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury recently received from one of those most closely connected with the school. In fairness, I shall not read the letter into the record, as some of it is about the rights of individuals and I do not want to prejudice those rights. I shall simply say that the correspondent wrote repeatedly to the Secretary of State asking him to look into events at the school, particularly the way in which individual members of staff had been treated. Despite those requests, the Secretary of State and the Minister of State consistently refused even to answer that correspondence.<br><br>
By way of comparison, I draw the Minister's attention to a school that has already been mentioned. In the process of opting out, representatives of that school met the Secretary of State and on the basis of that meeting, they advocated opting out because it meant better resources for the school. So the Secretary of State is prepared to meet people to dragoon them into opting out, he is prepared to proselytise and to promulgate propaganda, yet he is not prepared to meet those intimately connected with a school, when their livelihood and careers are at stake when his experiment in opting out is deemed to have come off the rails, as happened at Woodroffe school.<br><br>
Redundancies in opted-out schools deal the Conservative argument that opting out will lead to an

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 815</span>
educatioal paradise a major blow. We must recall that such redundancies mean that real people have suffered, seen their jobs disappear and their life skills and experience dissipated because of the incompetence of the management at that school. That may appear a harsh judgment, but there is evidence to justify it. Those redundancies may also be the result of the unsatisfactory way in which the school was established in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members appreciate the concerns expressed by the hon. Gentleman, but is he aware that the survey of grant-maintained schools conducted just before Christmas showed that 100 per cent. of the primary schools that responded, and 75 per cent. of the secondary schools, were employing more teachers? Is that not a good example of how such schools can employ more teachers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may happen in some schools, but the survey results do not negate the serious difficulties into which the Woodroffe school has got itself. I hope that the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) is not suggesting that those results should be a great consolation to the teachers who have had their jobs destroyed, nor that they may have kept those jobs had they been in a different sector of the education system—although it is true that, had they remained under LEA control, it is almost certain that their jobs would have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Knight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The survey stated that 100 per cent. of the primary schools that had gone grant maintained were employing more teachers. That is a considerable percentage improvement. The hon. Gentleman should recognise that, for every bad example that he chooses, there are other schools that are doing very well and producing real benefits for their pupils and staff. He is forgetting that for the sake of making a specific point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady will forgive me, I must say that it is silly to claim that I am using examples of insecure employment to make a point about the security of employment. She will understand that I cannot take her criticism too seriously. I have consulted my colleagues, briefly, and none are aware of the survey quoted by the hon. Lady. I hope that she will make details of it available so that the Committee may judge its validity: if she will let me have a copy, I should be glad to give it back to her later.<br><br>
The central point is that we are discussing the rights, duties and security of employment of members of staff. It is perfectly justifiable to refer to staff who have discovered that they do not have job security and that their job contracts have either been changed or simply torn up. As the newspaper headlines stated, those are "lessons in hardship". It is a severe hardship for any teacher to lose his or her job, as happened to the deputy head of the Woodroffe school.<br><br>
The experience of schools that opt out already shows that the managements of such schools have found it necessary to change fundamentally the terms and conditions of employment. The 1988 Act established the first opted-out schools, and provided for protection of some aspects of individual employment contracts. It allowed staff to transfer across to grant-maintained schools and retain their employment rights as individuals. However, there is a great debate, relating also to a clause in the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, which is in Committee in another Room, about the use of the European Community directive known as the acquired
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 816</span>
rights directive. That directive is interesting, because it has confronted Ministers and Government Departments with many questions about its impact on those whose employment is transferred from one employer to another.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
It is reasonably clear that the Department of Education believes that the directive has some impact on the transfer of employees from an LEA to the employ of a grant-maintained school. Correspondence from departmental officials makes it clear that that is thought to be the case. Is it the Minister's interpretation? There seems to be confusion between Government Departments about the directive's effect. Some seem to believe that it applies to the transfer of individual employees to different employers, and some that it does not.<br><br>
Among the important elements of the acquired rights directive is an obligation on an employer to inform and consult employee representatives about any proposed transfer. That is particularly important to me because it affects what happens in Trafford, one of the local education authorities in my constituency. There, the LEA and the governors of three schools—Sale Moor, New Wellington and Aston under Mersey—failed to consult staff when it was proposed that the schools should opt out. It is clear that if the acquired rights directive applied already and covered those teachers, the LEA and the schools were under an obligation to inform staff that the opting-out process was about to start. I hope that the Minister will not hide behind the fact that the matter has now been referred to an industrial tribunal by the National Union of Teachers. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] My hon. Friends quite rightly say hear, hear, because in this case the NUT is performing, not the role always ascribed to it by Conservative Members, but its legitimate role of protecting its members' rights when they have clearly been threatened by the action of their employer—in this case the Conservative-controlled, and rather hawkish, Trafford local education authority.<br><br>
It is important to establish the basis of individual rights in relation to such information, to be provided in consultation, which would apply under the directive. For the sake of completeness I should point out that the Government are legislating to bring the law up to speed with the directive. That is almost a technical requirement, in that, as I understand it, the directive already applies. The Government are merely codifying its requirements.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister understands my next point, which relates to the core of difficulties in employment law. One of the problems with employment law is that, as it is based on the concept of a civil contract, such a contract can, effectively, be ripped up by the employer—within the bounds of certain terms and conditions—at virtually a moment's notice. If the Minister doubts that, I must pray in aid the Under-Secretary of State for Employment, who is, I suppose, relatively expert in the subject. I wrote to the Secretary of State not long ago at the instigation of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South about Astra training services, which took over the skills training agency. I said in my letter that when the Department privatised the skills centres, it guaranteed the maintenance of the employment terms and conditions of staff at those centres, but that Astra training services had torn up those terms and imposed different contractual arrangements on its employees. The Under-Secretary of State replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"It may help if I explain the arrangements that were made at the time of privatisation to secure the terms and conditions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 817</span>
of employment of the staff who were to be transferred to the private sector. We ensured through the Employment Act 1989 that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations were applied to the sale. This had the effect of securing the transmission of most aspects of staffs terms. But the Regulations, and the EC Acquired Rights Directive, do not cover pension rights, which in the case of civil servants include redundancy rights. So we made separate arrangements through the Contracts of Sale to ensure that staff rights in these matters were transferred."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary states unequivocally that the Government were—unusually—trying to protect staff who had given considerable service to the skills training agency. Government legislation went beyond that of the EC directive. However, the Under-Secretary continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is, however, nothing to stop an employer and employees from subsequently agreeing to different terms and conditions".</p></blockquote>
That is reasonable in a free society, if it is achieved by negotiation. Different parties should be allowed to negotiate contracts. But the letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"nor to prevent an employer from seeking to impose changes unilaterally."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary was right. The fundamental weakness of this country's labour law is that, in extremis, it is not worth a candle in the wind. Too many unscruplous employers, in international, national and small companies rip up contracts of employment, destroy the contribution that employees have made over many years, and worsen terms and conditions of employment. Astra did that because it was in financial difficulties through mismanaging the skills centres. The schools that I mentioned earlier did that for reasons that are not clear—perhaps because of mismanagement or through underfunding. Financial pressure meant that they had to sack people.<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to rebut the charge that teachers are under pressure when schools opt out of LEA control, he must explain why empirical experience in schools shows that protection for staff is weak. The Under-Secretary of State for Employment acknowledges that the legal basis for protection is tenuous.<br><br>
Employees are worried about their ability to be represented collectively. Some people choose to be members of trade unions and others do not. I have been a member of a trade union for many years and I defend and advocate the need for strong and free trade unions. I served on the Committee that considered the Employment Bill 1990. A clause made clear that an employee has the right to belong or not to belong to a trade union. The Government hold—or pay lip service to—the view that individuals have the right to join trade unions. That right has no reality unless there is a mechanism by which the individual can be represented collectively. Trade union membership is about not the maintenance of individual rights, but the development of collective rights. The issue of collective rights becomes, once again, central at the point of transfer.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury has shown me the letter written to her by one of her constituents, Rodney Angell-Baker, who was a leading light in the campaign for Castle Hall school to opt out. I am not sure whether the word "successfully" is appropriate in this case, but the school achieved opt-out status. Mr. Angell-Baker is one of the many people who, having gone through the opting-out process, is now totally, sadly and bitterly disillusioned with the experience. He says in his letter:
<br><blockquote><p>"The way I feel at present I would not be sorry to see Castle Hall school closed down."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 818</span>
That is a damning indictment from someone who played such a key role in opting out. I hope that the Minister will consider that, because the Government should at least try to understand what they are asking ordinary people to do when they introduce legislation.<br><br>
Mr. Angell-Baker discovered that opting out was not the bed of roses, bowl of cherries, or any other piece of purple—or not so purple—prose that might be used to describe the new arrangements. The school ran into many difficulties. It began to take a hardline view of the rights of individuals to trade union membership and representation so that it became school policy not to recognise trade union membership. There is an extremely sad twist to the story. The daughter of the letter's author, Rebecca Angell-Baker, who was a member of the National and Local Government Officers Association and the school's secretary, became a victim of the school's new policy and was sacked.<br><br>
It would not be particularly helpful to ask the Minister to comment on the minutiae of the case, but when opted-out schools have a policy of not recognising trade unions, that means a serious change to the terms of conditions of those who work there. I know of many right-wing Conservative LEAs, but I am not aware of any LEA that refuses to recognise a trade union. Therefore, when someone, such as that young woman, is told that she cannot be a member of a trade union and when a school refuses to recognise trade union membership, that signifies a fundamental change to individual and collective employment rights.<br><br>
Under the European Community acquired rights directive, collective rights, as well as individual employment rights, are transferred. The right to be a member of a trade union is, first of all, enshrined in national law, but the right to be represented collectively—if that applied before the transfer to opted-out status—should be transferred when the school opts out. However, I put again to the Minister that that is fundamentally flawed, if the Under-Secretary of State for Employment is right to say that there is nothing to prevent an employer from seeking to impose unilateral changes when the transfer has been undertaken. The Under-Secretary's letter—this is important because I object strongly to that way of speaking—continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Essentially … these matters are … for a company and its employees and not for us"—</p></blockquote>
the Government. The Government cannot say that it will be all right on the night because they can always intervene. We know that the Minister's Department will have nothing to do with the Astra case. He stated in his letter that it was up to the affected individuals at Astra to pursue problems over their employment terms and conditions themselves, through tribunals or their trade unions.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
We know that the Secretary of State for Education refuses to discuss the matter of Woodroffe school in Dorset. He has refused to talk to anyone even though it is clear that some individuals' contracts of employment have been changed substantially and in some cases abrogated. We cannot accept being told, "Don't worry, the legislation will take its course and people will be protected."<br><br>
The Minister will say, because his brief says it, that the acquired rights directive must be looked at. It was interesting that when I raised the question of the directive with the Secretary of State for Employment some months ago she would not accept that it had had any impact on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 819</span>
employment rights, but of course there has been a little change since then because of court cases in the Netherlands and elsewhere. The acquired rights directive, as the Secretary of State makes clear, has a very limited impact over the short term on people's terms and conditions.<br><br>
We know of cases of employees in opted-out schools being sacked and of employees in opted-out schools having their contracts changed substantially. We know of schools that are approaching opting out whose teachers have not been given the information and consultation rights to which the directive entitles them. We know that the directive cannot offer them the protection that they will need. We know as a matter of basic human values that we as a Committee ought to ensure that those individuals have their employment rights maintained as they are transferred to opted-out schools. Teachers and schools support staff are not animals who can be herded into a new organisation with no rights; their contractual rights should be maintained. Those rights include individual terms and conditions, but they must also include their collective rights. That is most important.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can find a way out of this minefield. I understand that he has had a bit of a rough ride in Committee today on the subject of property. We do not want him to have a rough ride on the issue of staff. Property matters, but it is not as important as people who have given many years of valuable service to our community being afforded some dignity. I hope that the Minister will ensure that their rights are genuinely protected, and not just pay lip service to the concept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The drive to increase the number of grant-maintained schools will lead to further fragmentation in the management, deployment and professional development of school teachers. I do not believe that single school employers such as the education associations or governors of grant-maintained schools have sufficient training, expertise or facilities to manage effectively, and ensure the professional development of, the teaching force.<br><br>
The Government's interim advisory committee's report of 1988, which dealt with management issues, stated
<br><blockquote><p>"As we see it, the need for professional management of the teaching force would increase, not decrease, with the proposed reforms in education.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The scale of the local education authority operation would allow it to manage its teacher force effectively and professionally, offering opportunities for training, interchange and career development which would not be available to any single school employer."</p></blockquote>
The Government have created a situation in which teachers working in the same school may have different terms and conditions of employment from each other or terms and conditions that differ from those in other schools—LEA-controlled or grant-maintained—in the same locality. My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury mentioned that in passing.<br><br>
The recent case in the European Court of Dr. Sophie Redmond Stichting <i>v.</i> Bartol, and the consequent concession by the Government in the judicial review case brought by the National Association of Teachers of Further and Higher Education have important consequences for teachers and trade unions. Taken together, the cases allow teachers to rely upon the protection given by the EC acquired rights directive, which safeguards employees' rights on transfer of employer.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 820</span>
The importance of the two cases that I have quoted is that they have provided judicial support for the assertion that the United Kingdom regulations do not comply with the directive and allow a means for teachers and other public employers to assert their rights under the directive. In making the concessions in the NATFNE case, the Government have effectively accepted that teachers transferred to grant-maintained schools can rely on the directive.<br><br>
As the conditions of employment of teachers whose schools opt out are guaranteed by the Education Reform Act 1988, the directive will affect their collective rights. For example, the union representative's right to time off, as agreed with the LEA, will transfer to the governing body of the grant-maintained school. The right to information and consultation will apply and the unions will be entitled to information on the legal, social and economic implications of the transfer.<br><br>
The transferor—here the LEA and the present governing body—and the transferee—here the proposed new governing body of the school—are required to inform trade union representatives of the employees affected about the reasons for the transfer, the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer for employees and the measures envisaged that affect them.<br><br>
According to the minimum requirements of the directive, such information must be given in good time before the transfer is undertaken and, in any event, before employees are directly affected by the transfer in respect of their conditions of work and employment.<br><br>
If measures that affect employees are to be taken, there must be consultation in good time, with a view to seeking agreement. When a transfer has taken place—for example, when a school has opted out—the main purpose of the directive is to ensure that employees' rights are safeguarded.<br><br>
There is, in my view, a clear problem when an LEA recognises the educational provision in its area by a process of closing existing schools and establishing new schools, or by changing the character of existing schools so as to remove classes in one age group from the primary to the secondary sector, or vice versa, or from the secondary to the tertiary sector. As a result of those changes, responsibilities are transferred to new or different managing bodies with their own employment powers.<br><br>
If the transfer of undertakings regulations were not made to apply, it would be open to the new governing bodies to dispose of the services of those formerly employed and replace them simply on the technicality that they are not the actual employers—an opportunity that would clearly defeat the purpose of the regulations and the directive.<br><br>
It also follows that this problem will exist because of the confusion and chaos caused by a LEA sharing responsibilities with a funding agency for schools. The clause will not ensure the application of the acquired rights directive to grant-maintained schools. I hope that the Minister will deal with that problem.<br><br>
The prospect of a school going grant maintained will have profound consequences for everyone connected with it—parents, pupils, the local community and, not least, the teaching and non-teaching staff. The extra money which is made available when a school opts out may seem inviting, but there are significant long-term implications in divorcing a school from its neighbours and its LEA. By definition, grant-maintained schools are cut off—by choice
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 821</span>
—from the LEAs which formerly maintained such schools. LEAs have no further responsibility for or obligation to grant maintained schools, which is the object of seeking such status. A grant-maintained school cannot expect any assistance from LEA support services for teachers as of right, now or when the Bill becomes law. Staff cannot expect access to LEA-provided in-service training for professional development, to participate in consortium arrangements or joint curriculum development projects or for the school to have sporting links with LEA schools after opt out. Therefore, there is a risk of grant-maintained school teachers being cut off from professional and curriculum developments.<br><br>
The clause should provide for staff working in schools which become grant maintained to opt out of such schools' employment. It does not. Teachers at grant-maintained schools are not allowed to resign on the grounds of the school assuming such status, and the Bill will not allow resignation on those grounds. Staff may not be happy about changing their employer from an LEA to a governing body. They should be able to deal with such a problem by being able to work elsewhere for an LEA. Without such a provision, a teacher may be forced to continue working for a school governing body for several months or risk being unemployed and surrender possible redeployment with an LEA because he is unable to resign otherwise than by resignation on standard notice. That is unacceptable.<br><br>
National regulations require that teaching staff give two months notice—three months in summer—which must expire at the end of a term. Head teachers are required to give three months' notice—four in summer—which must expire at the end of a term. For example, if a school became grant maintained in May and a teacher had missed the resignation date for that term, the next resignation date would be 31 October, with the teacher being unable to leave until 31 December. Without provision for teaching staff to be voluntarily redeployed elsewhere within the LEA, prior to the transfer to grant-maintained status, the clause is severely flawed.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
Teaching staff have no say in the process of a school transferring to grant-maintained status. That, in itself, is wrong. When a school decides whether to change to that status, its' employees should have a say in the decision. They do not have such a right afforded to them. Therefore, they should have the right to be redeployed, if they so wish.<br><br>
While existing conditions of service may transfer at the time of the school transferring to grant-maintained status, provisions exist for governors of grant-maintained schools to opt out of national agreements on pay and conditions. They may also vary conditions for new staff appointed to the school and try to change the conditions for existing staff.<br><br>
Experience has shown that, in some grant-maintained schools, some of the staff would prefer not to continue to work for them because they had no influence over the decision to opt out. The clause should provide them with the option of alternative employment, if such employment is available. I accept that the availability of alternative employment is a major problem.<br><br>
Opted-out schools may result in unwanted changes to pay and conditions; therefore, those who wish to change
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 822</span>
should have the option of alternative employment. Clause 31 does not give that right to teachers. They have no rights under the clause to transfer. They have no say in the decision to opt out and are forced, by the decision of others, to change their conditions of service, and even to face possible redundancy, or the sack.<br><br>
When the Minister replies to the debate, I hope that he will be sympathetic to the arguments for teachers who do not wish to remain within the grant-maintained sector, but to transfer, if possible, to an LEA school. I hope that he will make provision in the clause for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) is a specialist in employment law and has been busy in that area for some time. I joined the Committee in the middle of its proceedings, and hon. Members may be aware that, recently, I served as the Government Whip in the Department for Employment, in which I had less of a speaking role but, nevertheless, a listening one. I have been ripped away from those duties just in advance of the Department's consideration of the acquired rights directive and the relevant clauses.<br><br>
I suspect from what we have heard tonight—but not what I hope we are about to hear—that members of the Committee feel that, in some ways, something has gone slightly wrong and that, perhaps, the discussion should be taking place two Rooms down the Corridor. The debate has primarily been about employment law and the hon. Member for Stretford made that point firmly. I shall reply to that shortly.<br><br>
I was interested in the speech of the hon. Member for the City of Durham although I was not entirely surprised by it. The issues of principle and especially the primacy that we put on the decision of parents to initiate and carry through the procedure for grant-maintained status have been debated at length. What was missing from the two long contributions that we have heard was a serious consideration of the role and position of the school.<br><br>
I do not wish to belittle the rights or interests of individuals employed in schools—they are important—but there is an important interest in securing the continued existence of the school and the future of its pupils and parents. In fairness to the Opposition, I do not think that they wish to destabilise those schools.<br><br>
The Government's view is that the clause is essential for the successful establishment of a grant-maintained school. It does not break new ground because it reproduces the staff transfer provisions of section 75 of the 1988 Act, with the provision that most school staff will remain at the school when it becomes grant maintained without any loss of their entitlements. That is intended to safeguard the position of the staff and the school.<br><br>
It is self-evident to all members of the Committee that the school must be staffed at the point at which it becomes grant maintained. More materially, it would not be in anybody's interest, let alone that of the local community, to have to recruit a brand new set of staff when a school moves from LEA to grant-maintained status. Nobody would welcome disruption of that kind.<br><br>
At the same time, I recognise that other people involved have an interest. The school's employees have a right to know in advance whether they are to remain in the employment of the school. They will know where they stand and the clause provides, with a few specific exceptions, that all LEA staff who are employed to work solely at a school that becomes grant maintained
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
automatically transfer. That is the substance of the concern that hon. Members have expressed. When the school becomes grant maintained, staff contracts will become as though they were made by the original governing body. Staff will retain their existing rights. I have taken account of what hon. Members have said about rights and I want to say something about them later.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stretford, who has a cup in front of him, has discussed many issues with me in the past. If he and I were faced with a half-empty cup, he would always say that it was half empty and I would be inclined to say that it was half full.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister pours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is a little unfair. I shall not press the analogy further except to say that I do not believe that we have a half-full cup in this case.<br><br>
The position developed by grant-maintained schools is one in which their cup runneth over. That is demonstrated by the survey that has been carried out recently. The hon. Member for Stretford is anxious to see it and we can make it available to him.<br><br>
That survey is of more than 100 grant-maintained schools and it is interesting to see what it reveals about the teaching side. All of the primary schools and three quarters of the secondary schools employed more teachers. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash. That amounts to one and a half new jobs for each school over a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure of 100 per cent. of primary schools appears very impressive, but it would be helpful if the Minister could tell the Committee how many primary schools took part in the survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the aggregate figure, but it was a significant number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was that significant number greater than 10?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not have the aggregate primary school figure, if one takes the figures together—the 100 per cent. of primary schools and the 77 per cent. of secondary schools which I rounded down because it is well known that the grant-maintained secondary school sector has developed more quickly—it is well known that, however one worked out the allocation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here come the cavalry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not need the cavalry. If the hon. Gentleman will contain himself, I shall administer the coup de grace. How extraordinary—the figure of 25 primary schools has just floated out of the air. I can therefore answer the question from the hon. Member for Wallsend and say that the figure was greater than 10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I owe it to the hon. Member for Wallsend to complete the point. However the distribution of the figures is worked out, even if compliance with these excellent staffing figures was not 100 per cent.—and I concede that it was not—it was somewhere between 75 per cent. and 100 per cent. That is remarkably encouraging. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) wants to have a go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give the equivalent percentages for the control group? On what basis were they compiled?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 824</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a control group. This is a survey of grant-maintained schools. Opposition Members are not backward in coming forward with stories about the way in which local education authorities cannot finance their schools and may have to sack teachers. However, I should be surprised if LEA-maintained schools could replicate those figures.<br><br>
More than one and a half new jobs were created for each of the more than 100 grant-maintained schools surveyed. In addition, more than half of the secondary schools, and just over two thirds of the primary schools employed more administrative staff. That may not be to everybody's liking, but the survey contains better news about classroom support: a third of the secondary schools and 56 per cent. of the primary schools employed more people in that regard.<br><br>
That shows that the real world is somewhat different from the world inhabited by the hon. Member for Stretford. We do not claim that everything is perfect in the grant-maintained world, but there has been a significant and powerful improvement.<br><br>
What are the prospects for the future? The hon. Member for Stretford told a number of anecdotes alleging difficulties. It is interesting to note that staff turnover has fallen significantly in most of the surveyed schools and that the quality of applicants has improved. In the changes reported for last year, five teachers were promoted. Staff retired in four schools, but that is bound to happen. Two schools lost staff to maternity, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not object to that.<br><br>
The general evidence about grant-maintained schools is "by their fruits ye shall know them"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that in maternity cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Names, names.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not in the privacy of the Committee.<br><br>
To return to the substantial points: first, the provision applies, as it must, at the moment of transfer, which it is intended to facilitate. Under the provisions of the 1988 Act, at a point after transfer the general employment rights cut in. The hon. Member for Stretford spoke at length about how he would like to reform those provisions. I am not sure how he thought he would do that or what, precisely, he wanted. Even if I were to tempt him to come forward with his proposals tonight, they would perhaps go wide of the clause and I am not sure that you would wish us to turn this into a general debate on employment, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
The clause provides a snapshot of the position of grant-maintained schools. We need to safeguard their position from day one. This clause does that. Opposition Members are perhaps disposed to regard the status quo as always admirable, although the status quo itself has changed over the years. They may wish to change that view.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
At present, there is general adoption of and, I believe, an increasing welcome for local management of schools. In practice, the effect of that is that the governors are responsible for the management of their schools' budgets. That has clear implications for the security of employment of teachers in maintained schools under the local management. I concede that, formally, the LEA remains the employer. But the hire-and-fire powers effectively go to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
the governors. Incidentally, it is worth considering what has happened to two adjacent schools in my constituency; one is an infant school and the other a junior one. As a result of the budget—I shall not go into details about how that may or may not change—and the formula as it worked out, as well as for other reasons, one set of governors decided to dismiss two teachers and, at the same time, the other school took staff on. All that can apply under the existing maintained system. It is folly for members of this Committee to assume that they can somehow create complete security of tenure by attempting to knock out this clause.<br><br>
We are attempting to provide a smooth transition and a sensible enshrinement of employee rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me get this absolutely right—incidentally, this is also my interpretation. The Minister seems to be saying that, at the moment of transfer, contractual rights are maintained. That is what the clause means. However, the moment after transfer, any new management structure adopted by the governors of the grant-maintained school would be legally empowered to abrogate those contracts. I hope that the Minister will respond specifically to this point: in the event that grant-maintained schools, individually or in large numbers, tore up the contracts of employment for teachers and other staff and worsened their employment conditions, would the Secretary of State for Education take any action? Could he take any action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to take further advice on the matter, but I think the essential point is that the protection for employees is set out in section 75 of the 1988 Act. That protection continues, as does that provided by the general employment law to which we have already referred and the specific provisions about the right of an employee to terminate a contract if a substantial change occurred to his detriment, as set out in subsection (8) of the clause. In my view, the matter is satisfactorily covered. It is certainly as well covered as within the LMS provisions that I discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In effect, the Minister is saying that the clause as it stands is all the protection that will be offered. He failed to say—although it seems apparent from reading between the lines—that in the event of the governors of a grant-maintained school systematically worsening the employment conditions of their employees, to save money or for other reasons, the Government would stand idly by and do nothing at all about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given no such commitment. I have said that that protection is essentially provided by employment law and is strengthened by the 1988 Act, together with the obligations of the governors. I am not prepared to speculate about a situation which I regard as entirely hypothetical and, on the evidence which I have adduced, extremely unlikely. But if the hon. Gentleman wishes to weave castles in the air, he may do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the nub of the issue. These are not castles in the air, but schools in the here and now. Is the Minister saying that he does not believe that Scotby primary school—not one of those in his 100 per cent. survey, incidentally—made people redundant? Does not he believe that Woodroffe school in Dorset made people redundant? Those are no castles in the air—I am talking about real teachers whose jobs have disappeared. If school
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
after school used the policy systematically, as a way of saving money, would the Secretary of State intervene and do something about it? We need to know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need to come back to the question that I put to the hon. Gentleman at the beginning of his remarks, to which I did not receive a satisfactory answer. Were the allegations that he was adducing directed towards what he regarded as undesirable practices when an element of legislation might have been appropriate, or towards breaches of the existing law? I think that he was beginning to feel that in the case of the first school, there might have been an alleged breach of the existing law because he said that the matter had been remitted to an industrial tribunal. That puts the school's employees in essentially the same position as other employees in relation to their contracts and rights, which does not seem wrong in principle. Given that the hon. Gentleman may have wanted to embellish that or to build in further rights, it is interesting that he did not table amendments other than those relating to the acquired rights directive, which have not been selected for debate. Perhaps he will tell the Committee what further safeguards he would have liked us to introduce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to take up the Minister's invitation. With regard to Scotby primary school, there is an outstanding industrial tribunal case to be heard. There is also an industrial tribunal taking place which concerns teachers in my local authority of Trafford. I pointed out to the Minister that those intimately connected with the governors of Woodroffe school are greatly concerned about the way in which management has dealt with the employees. Those matters have been referred to Ministers, who have refused to deal with it, so it is a little difficult for me to say what the position is now.<br><br>
The industrial tribunal will come to its own conclusions. Unfortunately, however, it cannot conclude, in the event of unfair dismissal, that an employee should be reinstated. I think that the law is wrong in failing to provide that protection, a belief which my party shares and has stated on several occasions.<br><br>
I have been talking about real cases in which people who have lost their jobs do not have that protection. The Secretary of State is effectively telling them that they are on their own and that there is nothing he can or will do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an incomplete view of the law. Those safeguards, which are available to other employees and can be used in their support by unions and advisers, are significant and fair. The hon. Gentleman is in effect saying that he wants an extension of employment law, but that would not always benefit employees. However seductive such courses of action may be, they may reduce the disposition of employers to employ and increase the costs of business, making it more difficult for employers to employ. Those are general issues which I do not intend to debate further.<br><br>
Let me return to my earlier point. In grant-maintained schools, the experience has been improved staffing and improved staff morale. That speaks for itself. The hon. Gentleman may say that everything is for the best in the LEA-maintained sector at the moment, but that is his opinion, not mine or that of my hon. Friends.<br><br>
In addition to acquired rights under section 75 of the 1988 Act, there is the question of assured rights under European law, to which the hon. Gentleman referred and to which I referred in passing. No amendment has been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
tabled on that subject. Those rights are general rights and are not confined to this group of employees. They are covered by a European directive, so whether we like it or not they are part of our law and employees may have recourse to them even though they are not specifically set out in our statutes. The hon. Gentleman rightly and fairly referred to the fact that the Government are currently proposing to put those rights more explicitly on the statute in a different Bill. Those rights apply and, if they have been breached, employees have recourse to the law.<br><br>
It seems to me that the central point that the Opposition do not wish to grasp is the need for continuity in the interests of the pupils as much as the school. They have used anecdotal evidence to suggest that there have been improper employment practices in some schools. I shall not comment on the details and I shall not intervene in the management of those schools under the new arrangement. I doubt that my colleagues will find it appropriate to do so either. Safeguards have been put in place through the legislation and, more generally, through our employment law. The Opposition may argue strongly that there are cases of alleged difficulty, but the general record belies that.<br><br>
The essential principle that we have adopted—on which we remain at odds with the hon. Member for City of Durham—is that the decision on whether a school should become grant-maintained should be made by the parents. The management of grant-maintained schools is responsible for its own decisions and management structures, is responsible for operating within the law and is liable if it is in breach of that law. We want to put the management of grant-maintained schools in the driving seat and we are satisfied that the clause represents the smoothest way of affecting a transfer of staff. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not intend to vote against the clause because, limited though it is, it offers protection of the kind that we are advocating. The Minister's reply was skilful but unsatisfactory: the reading was lovely but the message was rubbish. The fundamental problem, as my hon. Friend for City of Durham and I have tried to point out, is that the number of staff has eroded. That has affected people in schools as they have changed from LEA to opted-out status.<br><br>
We are worried that, when the little inducements for schools to opt out have begun to disappear, and when opt-out schools, such as Woodroffe school and Scotby school, are in the real world, where money is tight, they will have to get rid of staff.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Since one cannot bribe all of the people all of the time, the problem is that if the opting out revolution is successful, several of those schools will be under financial pressure, which they will try to avoid, not by more skilful management, but simply by eroding the terms and conditions of those who work for them. That will, in the long run, be extremely bad for the morale of the teaching profession and for education.<br><br>
or those reasons I am concerned that the Minister has answered with a quiet, but clear, no to the question of whether the Secretary of State has power to, or would, intervene. The Secretary of State, faced with such an erosion of standards, chooses—unusually for one who has taken on so many powers—not to take on any powers. The Minister is right. The Secretary of State could not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
intervene under the terms of the Bill. That means that if such erosion of terms and conditions occurs, not only will teachers and other school employees be on their own, but so will the people we put through our schools.<br><br>
One of the Bill's fundamental tragedies is that it may become the legislation that erodes the working conditions and professional climate in schools. That will be an indictment of the Ministers responsible, for the rest of their working lives, which will, I trust, be shorter—in ministerial office at least—than those of the teachers whom we wish to protect.<br><br>
As I have said, there is little point in our trying to erode conditions further by voting against the clause and we do not intend to, but I hope that the Minister might reflect on some of the points that have been made, and see whether he can come back and do better.</span></p>

"PENDING" PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF GRANT-MAINTAINED STATUS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 18, line 3, leave out from beginning to 'on' in line 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 299, 300 and 301.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments would extend the pending period, which, as the Committee will be aware, is a kind of quarantine period, in which the counter-obstruction provisions have effect. In practice that means that local authorities are constrained from disposing of assets or removing them from schools before they become grant maintained, or from entering into contracts with which the governing body would not wish to deal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 298 would push the beginning of the pending period for the transfer of assets back from the moment of the governors' resolution to the moment the LEA is given notification of intention to hold a governors' meeting. That is interesting because I remember an earlier discussion handled by the Under-Secretary of State for Schools, in which there was pressure to provide for the notification of intention to go out to the LEA as soon as possible. Here we are, in effect, saying that the pending period would run from the earliest possible moment.<br><br>
I am sorry, in a sense, that the provisions are necessary. Perhaps Labour Members will say that nothing ever goes wrong and that they have the best intentions towards grant maintained schools and no wish to frustrate the transfer if it is the wish of the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not wish to make them even worse than they are going to be made anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman does not want to make them worse, because, sadly, that has happened in some cases. I shall not go into some of the smaller instances. Perhaps the clearest was that of the freehold land of Audenshaw high school. Aware that that was likely to pass to the school on incorporation, before the pending period operated Tameside borough council set itself up with a property company to which it transferred the freehold of the school. The land was then leased back to the local authority to use for the purposes of the school.<br><br>
That got to a judicial review, Regina <i>v.</i> Tameside metropolitan borough council ex parte the governors of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0564">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
Audenshaw high school and the Educational Assets Board. The avoidance scheme was quashed on the basis that there had been a failure to consult and to consider the educational implications of the scheme.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to do no more than safeguard the position and not permit irregular or unreasonable action which, if even contemplated by a local authority, should be stopped at the earliest possible moment. The trigger point by which the pending period is initiated will be shifted forward until the moment that the LEA is notified of the intention to move a resolution rather than the moment at which it is actually implemented. The practical difference is relatively short—perhaps a week or 10 days at most—but it is important that if those powers are to safeguard the transfer, they should operate from the earliest possible moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some succinct and informative comments on the amendment. Being new to the Committee, the Minister will not know that I shall, of course, be impeccably uncontroversial.<br><br>
The amendment is an example of how legislation works against the Government's declared intention in other areas of policy and does not deal with the difficulties that I shall outline briefly. The Minister was not in the Committee when Opposition Members used two words that caused the Under-Secretary of State for Schools particular difficulty. We said that the matter would cause "confusion and chaos". I am sure that the Minister has scoured carefully the record of our proceedings and will be familiar with our anxieties about "confusion and chaos" in many other parts of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment does not deal with potential abuse of the pending procedure and I want to make some serious points on that. There is a possibility that LEAs will not have the power to carry out certain functions that the Government wish them to fulfil. Despite the best efforts of Conservative Members, approximately 98·5 per cent. of schools are still maintained, run and controlled by LEAs and the signs are that they will maintain a large percentage of schools for many years to come.<br><br>
LEAs need to plan. I do not want to exercise all our earlier arguments on parallel operations, with the funding agency and the LEAs working—or not working—together, but LEAs need to plan the provision of places and, in some instances, the reduction of places. That matter is dear to the heart of the Secretary of State for Education who said when he opened the debate on Second Reading on 9 November:
<br><blockquote><p>"We must also deal with the removal of surplus school places, of which there are up to 1·5 million in England alone." He went on to say that about £300 million a year would be saved by closing those places, and:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"That is just the premises-related cost—it does not include the capital sums that would be available if the buildings and land could be sold and the proceeds ploughed back into education.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 635.]</p></blockquote>
Local education authorities need to plan. They will need to close places and take buildings out of use in some schools. Between 1983 and September 1993, Devon county council will have closed 20 schools in Plymouth. The majority of schools were closed before the ability to opt out existed. The closures were controversial, but parents
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
were fully consulted. The local authority used the proceeds of the sale of small, inefficient schools to create larger, better resourced schools in Plymouth. That occurred partly under a Conservative administration, and partly under a hung council. Closure was carried out efficiently and sensitively. The local authority did that before schools could opt out and thwart the plans of the LEA to save money and make better use of its resources to plan better schools.<br><br>
If school governors are allowed to include in their agenda notice of a motion to consider opting out, it could be used as a holding procedure almost indefinitely. If the item was placed on an agenda every quarter and a decision was never made, the school could be in a permanent pending period. In my area, a school has used such a procedure to prevent the LEA from selling its playing fields. The LEA threatened to sell the playing fields of a community college, which then initiated the opt-out procedure. The governors did not intend to opt out. They continued with that procedure until the LEA removed the threat. They thwarted the efforts of the county council.<br><br>
Some schools are threatened with closure because they are failing or because numbers of pupils have declined. The Secretary of State expressed strong opinions about such schools. The LEA is responsible for using resources efficiently and effectively. It could be thwarted by governors who place the school in a permanent pending period. The clause needs more careful thought. A governing body could thwart the Secretary of State's efforts to reduce places by 1·5 million and thereby save £300 million, by taking action that is akin to planning blight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the hon. Gentleman made the case that a LEA has the power to dispose of school property in advance of the proposals coming into force. We made that case this morning. The effect of the clause is not to introduce a pending period, but to shift the point at which the pending period takes place. His point is that there is potential for abuse of the pending procedure as a device for putting off the consideration of a reorganisation.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will also assert that there was such an abuse in the case to which he referred. I would have to study it before commenting. However, his point would arise in relation not to the change to the pending procedure, but to the principle of the procedure as it may work in practice.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is a line under the pending procedure. The system allows a resolution by governors, two ballots, an eventual approval by the Secretary of State and the implementation of proposals, or, as the present provisions state, a resolution when the procedure is terminated. I think that his specific concern is that people could keep triggering the pending procedure under existing legislation or under the proposals. I should like to consider his interesting point further and shall inform the Committee if I feel that it is not dealt with in the provisions or that it could be met effectively in another manner. I undertake to examine the hon. Gentleman's point with care.</span></p>

CONTROL OF DISPOSALS OF LAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 18, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() Where proposals for acquisition of grant-maintained status are approved, the procedure for acquisition of grant-maintained status is not to be treated as terminated for the purposes of this section and section 34 of this Act in relation to any land where agreement is required to be reached under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 10 to the Education Reform Act 1988 (identification of property, etc.) on any matter relating to that land until the date on which that matter is finally determined'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the extension of the control of disposals of land in the pending period with a resulting implicit extension to the compulsory purchase powers of the Education Assets Board to the period after the implementation date. This follows the precedent in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 where land is in dispute between a local authority and the EAB on behalf of a grant-maintained school. In this context, land includes buildings. This matter is one of clarification. While the ownership of chattels can be resolved quickly, land transfers take some time to agree. The position may not be clear when the proposals are implemented and the grant-maintained school is set up.<br><br>
I should make it clear that legally property vests on the day of implementation, whatever that property is or may be found to be. There is an analogy with nationalisation legislation: it is not always possible to work out what the assets of a company are on vesting day, but on that day all those assets will be transferred. If we do not know we need to find out. There should be a remedy if the land is disposed of wrongfully. Therefore, we need to provide for a post-pending period so that the matter may be tidied up and related back to the point of vesting.<br><br>
Such a provision is in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, and we now feel that, on balance, it is worth including a similar provision in the Bill as a safeguard for the difficult cases of disputes over what land and buildings are to be transferred.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'except where such a person is employed in support of a child with special educational needs.'.</p></blockquote>
This is an important amendment. Under the clause, a teacher employed at a school that is about to become grant-maintained may be teaching full time or part time but still be part of a wider support service for children with special needs in the local authority area. Many of the charities and voluntary organisations that help and support childern with special needs are worried that there could be a loss of service to the wider local authority area. I hope that the Government accept the spirit of the amendment because we need to overcome that problem.<br><br>
I shall consider the problem as it might affect support services for deaf children. Many schools act as a resource centre for the provision of services for children with hearing impairment in the whole or part of local authority area. The Audit Commission and HMI report "Getting on with the Act" supported the concept of a service provided centrally by the LEA, which would provide flexibility for those schools where there are particular needs.<br><br>
Because the level of hearing impairment can vary widely from an almost total inability to hear to a slight problem, a child sometimes needs very special treatment and equipment. On other occasions, it is merely a matter of the hearing support service and a teacher of the deaf, who may work principally in one school and attend other schools from time to time to provide help and information to mainstream teachers to make them aware of how they should tackle the problems of children with hearing impairments.<br><br>
In addition to identifying children with hearing loss and measuring the scale of that loss, the support services will assess their needs and train teachers to be more effective in teaching such children. The services will also provide support for parents, liaise with other organisations and ensure that childern are taught in such a way that they have proper access to the national curriculum. Unfortunately—[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A number of conversations are taking place in the Committee Room among hon. Members from both sides. In fairness, we should listen to the hon. Gentleman. It is unfair to him if conversations are taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin.<br><br>
Unfortunately, there is already the danger that the service could be fragmented. There are signs that grant-maintained schools are not buying the service for children with hearing loss. That is one of the reasons why the Audit Commission and HMI report, "Getting on with the Act" recommended that services should be provided by LEAs in a manner that was flexible to meet the needs of children in particular schools.<br><br>
The National Deaf Children's Society has already dealt with one case in which a grant-maintained school refused to buy half-termly support for a severely deaf child who did not have a statement that made clear what the child's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
needs were. The National Deaf Children's Society was told by the child's parents that the grant-maintained school refused to buy the support because it had worries about its finances. I could hardly credit it when I was told of that case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is arguing about the appointment of staff during the pending period. Will he explain the relationship between the amendment and section 38(2)(b)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite simply, it is to ensure that a teacher, such as a specialist who provides deaf support services principally in one school, does not become wholly a member of that school's staff when that school becomes grant-maintained. If that happened, that teacher may no longer be available for work in the wider local authority area.<br><br>
As I was saying when I allowed the hon. Member for Hertsmere to intervene, in that particular case grant-maintained schools might fear that they could not afford to allow that member of staff to spend four, five, six or eight teaching periods visiting other schools and advising mainstream teachers working with children with hearing loss. The amendment would ensure that specialist teachers would not be tied up in grant-maintained schools simply because they are based mainly in such schools for their work in the wider local authority area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain for what length of time he believes that the problem he has described might persist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that it would persist for as long as such a specialist teacher remains in a grant-maintained school. If that school decided that it could not allow that teacher to be away for half a day or a day a week advising staff in other schools in the area, that teacher's advice and skill would be lost to those other schools. I am merely seeking some flexibility for what I am sure will be a small minority of cases. All the special needs groups involved have expressed their anxiety that special needs staff at a grant-maintained school who also serve the wider area might not be able to do that when the school becomes grant-maintained.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to understand the meaning of both the clause and the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Will he say whether the period for which this problem might persist will be just the pending time, or will it extend beyond that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, it would occur in the pending time, but it could extend beyond that if, after the school becomes grant-maintained, the terms of the change to that status mean that a special needs teacher had to remain a member of that school's staff. The hon. Gentleman said something significant when he mentioned that he was trying to understand the meaning of the clause. My impression is certainly that the clause appears to tie teachers to the grant-maintained school in the pending period and, by implication, after it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am trying to get at the meaning of the clause and of the amendment, which would add to subsection (3)(b), at line 38 of page 22, the words
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"except where such a person is employed in support of a child with special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman is nodding. However, the opening words of subsection (3) are "this subsection", which means that subsection (3) applies to those cases. To discover what that relates back to, the hon. Gentleman must look at subsection (2)(b) which deals with the dismissal of employees. That is what subsection (3)(b) applies to—it does not apply to any other element of the clause. If the hon. Gentleman relates subsection (3) back to subsection (2)(b), he will find that it refers to the dismissal of an employee by an LEA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the clause and I have tried to follow his argument very closely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The practical effect of the clause prevents the dismissal by the LEA of somebody who falls into the categories stated in subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b). The amendment would make an exception of somebody who is employed in support of a child with special educational needs. Is that the hon. Gentleman's intention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the clause and I shall be even more interested in the Department for Education's interpretation of the clause. My understanding is that it will not work in the way in which the hon. Gentleman states that it should. Therefore, setting aside the interpretation of the clause, I am raising a genuine issue in the context of what will happen. When a school becomes grant-maintained, but has staff teachers who provide a service for children with special needs, those teachers may be tied to the grant-maintained school and may be unable to work in the wider area without an agreement between the grant-maintained school and the LEA. That fear has been raised with me.<br><br>
The clause ties such teachers to the grant-maintained school and, potentially, prevents them from working in the wider LEA, if that was the wish of the school once it became grant-maintained. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that issue because the organisations involved with children with special needs believe that that is what is likely to happen under the clause. That is why they approached me about moving such an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman's remarks after I have taken advice. My understanding of the clause is that it applies only to schools that do not have delegated budgets. Those schools are already in a minority and, after April 1994, they would arise only in exceptional circumstances. The clause applies only during the formal pending time, about which we talked earlier. It is a limited power.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should also realise that an LEA can make proposals and the Secretary of State can give consent—with the consent of the existing governing bodies as stated in subsection (6)—to such proposals. It would be perfectly possible to safeguard the position during the pending period with consent. That is designed to counter obstruction, not to prevent any changes completely.<br><br>
It is also necessary to consider some of the more general points that the hon. Gentleman quite properly made about safeguarding service. He would share my view that we need to provide an adequate service for children with special educational needs in a school that becomes grant-maintained. Equally we must safeguard the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
provision that may appear at that school on behalf of other children from other schools that may remain with the LEA. We have to get that right. I cannot and should not give a prescription for each individual case but a formula does need to be found to deal with each case. The pending period and the consideration of the property disposals by the Education Assets Board, would provide, in the event of a dispute, an opportunity for that to be carried out.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, to whom I may be looking in extenso for legal advice after my inquiries, may be encouraged that I have been advised that he is right to say that, because the amendment amends subsection (3) it only affects LEA decisions relating to the dismissal of staff. However, that is a complicated point. Our substantive aim is to attack obstruction, not to frustrate reasonable arrangements that may be made at an appropriate time. However, I should say that it is difficult to introduce a provision for such staff without paying regard to other staff or staff who may have a dual use between special educational needs and mainstream teaching. The correct balance needs to be struck in those complicated matters.<br><br>
In view of the doubts and concerns that have been expressed by members of the Committee, we shall certainly examine this matter to confirm, without any commitment, that we have the balance right. That is essential in this sensitive matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving us an enlightened and correct interpretation of the clause's aims. In light of his encouraging comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 521, in page 22, line 38, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'but not to any person who under his contract of employment may be required to work in any school maintained by the local education authority notwithstanding that he may be allocated to fill for the time being a post which is part of the complement of the school.'.</p></blockquote>
It is hardly worth starting, but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not want to move his amendment I shall move mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Grant-maintained schools are entirely independent of the LEA. The staff at such schools are no longer its employees. The LEA does not have the obligation that it has for its own employees to find suitable alternative employment for redundant teachers from such schools. If the governing body of a grant-maintained school declares redundancies, perhaps because of a shortfall in pupil enrolments or because the school is in financial difficulties, the local authority is under no obligation to find alternative teaching posts for those redundant teachers.<br><br>
That lack of obligation poses a real threat to teachers and the teaching profession. As the hon. Member for Stretford informed the Committee earlier this evening, Woodroffe, the flagship, opt-out school, found itself at least £80,000 in the red and had to axe seven teachers last September. Woodroffe was the first opt-out school to find itself in such acute financial difficulties that it had to make teachers redundant.<br><br>
The case of Woodroffe is not an isolated one. In Tuesday's sitting I mentioned Scotby school in Cumbria
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
which laid off staff after becoming grant-maintained, despite assurances from the Government that the school would be better off for equipment and teachers if it opted out.<br><br>
The School Teachers' Pay and Conditions (No. 2) Act 1991 is of particular importance, because it gives the governors of grant-maintained schools new opportunities to control the pay and conditions of teachers in their schools by opting out of the proposed new machinery for pay and conditions. Indeed, the proposals in the Bill are not supportive of a co-operative approach, but will exacerbate the problems, by further fragmenting the education service. The Bill will cause schools to compete against one another, threaten job security and cause further changes to the way in which schools are managed, without regard to the views of the teaching profession. The morale and confidence of teachers will be further undermined by the proposals.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 24, line 23, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'a school which adopts a curriculum differing in detail from the National Curriculum but compatible, in the view of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0568">Image</span>

National Curriculum in terms of (a) scope and (b) standards will be eligible for grant-maintained status. Compatibility in relation to standards will be deemed to have been established if such a school can show that its pupils are likely to attain levels of achievement at ages 16 and 18 equivalent to the England average (for schools in England) or the Wales average (for schools in Wales) at schools studying the National Curriculum.'.</p></blockquote>
I am sure that hon. Members will understand if I say that I am suffering from a slight feeling of unreality, now that we have to come to discuss one of my amendments. It is by far the most important, as well as the most constructive. It works with the grain of the Bill, being consistent with its best intentions—as expressed in the phrase "choice and diversity". The amendment would allow
<br><blockquote><p>"a school which adopts a curriculum differing … from the National Curriculum but compatible, in the view of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, with the National Curriculum in terms of (a) scope and (b) standards"</p></blockquote>
to become grant maintained.<br><br>
The amendment accepts the reality of grant-maintained status and makes use of it to enable certain schools that currently are debarred from obtaining funding to do so. Examples of such schools include the Rudolf Steiner schools—here I declare an interest as there is one in my constituency—and schools that teach the Montessori and Froebel curricula. If there were no grant-maintained sector it would be necessary to define other means by which this right to funding could be brought about. But the grant-maintained mechanism exists and I suggest that it should be used.<br><br>
I emphasise my conviction, as a teacher with 32 years' experience, of the importance of ensuring that pupils are taught, as an entitlement, a curriculum that is broad, balanced and relevant. That is the rationale for a core curriculum—the fundamental idea behind the national curriculum. It attempts to guarantee an entitlement to the provision of a teaching "menu" that has its own coherence and integrity. We could argue about whether the national curriculum is too prescriptive, as I and others believe, but that matter is for another debate.<br><br>
It will be no surprise that I challenge the propriety of the word "national" as applied to the curriculum, but for the moment that, too, is a side issue. I am not challenging the principle that the Government have a right to set out a basic core curriculum as an entitlement for children. However, no one would argue that the national curriculum is the last word in curricula. Not even its most enthusiastic advocates would argue that it has absolute validity. No doubt it will undergo modification in future. In 10 years, perhaps, some will examine it and want to modify it significantly.<br><br>
There will be sympathy for my argument that in an open, enlightened, liberal society there should be room for alternative curricula as long as they do not transgress the basic entitlement. I am not speaking of random variations to the national curriculum or marginal insertions or modifications here and there for the convenience of all types of schools because that is another issue. If such freedoms were allowed, problems could be created for the Government. They might be inundated with applications from all types of schools for variations to the national curriculum. I am referring to truly alternative curricula, which have their own coherence, integrity, breadth,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
balance and relevance, derived from a distinctive philosophical base and yet compatible with the national curriculum in scope and standard.<br><br>
Before dealing with the words "scope" and "standard", I should like to consider compatibility. The amendment would make the question of a curriculum's compatibility a matter for the school curriculum and assessment authority to determine. That decision would be subject to discussion and, no doubt, to negotiation between such schools and the authority. That authority would no doubt set out guidelines on compatibility and presumably the Secretary of State would also have a role—the decision would, I accept, ultimately require the Secretary of State's sanction.<br><br>
It would also be necessary to guarantee equal access and opportunities for boys and girls. That would be a fundamental condition. Staff would be required to be properly qualified, trained and certificated in a way acceptable to the state.<br><br>
I should like, in discussing scope and standards as they relate to compatibility, to refer to Rudolph Steiner schools, about which I know a little. To begin with scope, the list of subjects taught at those schools and at the maintained schools that I know and have carefully observed, are nearly identical. Movement—which, by the way, includes games—is listed instead of physical education.<br><br>
There are many similarities between Steiner and maintained schools in the percentage of time allocated to each subject. In Rudolph Steiner schools, 12 per cent. of the time is given to craft and technology at age 11, and the same is allocated to technology—including information technology—in conventional schools. The variation in the percentages of time allocated to subjects at different ages in Rudolph Steiner schools is interesting. Science takes up 5 per cent. of the time between the ages of five and 10, and 15 per cent. between ages of 11 and 16. Art and music take up 10 per cent. of the time between the ages of five to seven; 6 per cent. at the ages of 11 to 14 and 8 per cent. at the ages of 15 and 16.<br><br>
The variation of time to subjects at different ages is a fundamental feature of Rudolph Steiner schools. It is not arbitrary, but reflects the philosophical framework in which the schools work. It is based on their understanding of children's developmental stages. It is not fanciful experimentalism. We have seen far too much of that. I saw too much of it when I was teaching. Occasional bursts of experimental ideas leading in certain directions would later be reversed. The Rudolph Steiner schools' curriculum is not like that. It is well established over many years and is based on pedagogic practice that has been found to work.<br><br>
That brings us to the question of standards. It is a well-known fact that examination results in Rudolph Steiner schools for GCSE and A-levels are well above the national average in Britain. That is also true in other countries. The German Government conducted research and found a strikingly high level of achievement right across the curriculum. In Germany, there are 153 Steiner schools.<br><br>
8.45 pm<br><br>
My amendment would ensure that compatibility on standards would be determined by performance at the ages of 16 and 18. At present, that would be done under GCSE and A-level examinations and, in future, by whatever means of asessment or examination the state chooses to use. That issue of examination is now in the melting pot,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
but determining the compatibility of standards at the ages of 16 and 18 is the important one. It is the outcome at those ages that counts. That measures the success of the educational regime through which pupils have passed.<br><br>
In Steiner schools the development stages principle means that the work is paced diferently. That creates a significant difference in comparison with the system in conventional schools. Students undergoing that type of education have said that they believe that teaching based on the developmental stages principle—phasing the teaching—is highly economical in the use of time and leads to concentrated and rapid progress when aspects of the curriculum are introduced according to the stage of development that the pupil has reached.<br><br>
I referred to the determination of standards and the relationship of that to the ages of 16 and 18. The point is that the curriculum in such schools is paced differently. Reading is taught in a radically different way and literacy is achieved at a later age than would be the case in a conventional school. Reading assessments based on the national curriculum for seven-year-olds would not be appropriate in a Steiner school. The levels of attainment would vary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is valid. He has said that in Steiner schools the curriculum is matched to meet the pupil's needs and the pupil is not made to match the curriculum's needs. He has an important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. Apart from the national curriculum and standard assessment tasks, conventional schools have been trying to establish literacy at as early an age as possible. They regard that as a matter of pride and achievement. Steiner schools are relaxed about the teaching of literacy at an early age and they have particular reasons to be so.<br><br>
In Steiner schools, foreign languages are introduced very early—from the age of five—and without the use of textbooks because literacy is not achieved at that age. It would be absurd to teach foreign languages at that age using books. The early introduction of foreign languages leads to a remarkably high level of attainment, fluency and ease of communication in foreign languages by Steiner pupils generally. That is part of those schools' emphasis on internationalism. Such an international outlook is important for me—and I term myself a nationalist—as it is for everyone else.<br><br>
Arrangements for the assessment of alternative curricula in the cases I have envisaged would be a matter for negotiation with the school curriculum and assessment authority or the school curriculum and assessment authority for Wales. Different patterns of assessment would be needed in such schools.<br><br>
I emphasise that alternative arrangements for such schools would not provide a loophole enabling them to escape from the requirements of the national curriculum. They would not enable schools to avoid SATS for pupils aged seven—even though many schools would like to be able to do that. The alternative arrangements would have to be justified to the curriculum authority in terms of pedagogic practice and the theoretical and philosophical framework of the teaching.<br><br>
Another objection suggested by some people to the amendment is that it would enable public schools—they should be called private schools—to obtain funding by becoming grant maintained. That fear is baseless. Such schools, which include the great public schools, have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
generous staffing levels, are able to offer teachers higher salaries and attract a higher quality of staff because they charge fees. Grant-maintained schools are not allowed to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the independent sector. How would he feel about a small independent or private school which, for reasons good or bad, was failing financially and decided to go grant maintained? My hon. Friend the Minister has not spoken about that, so I do not know the Government's view on the matter, but I should be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting and valid question. I was just about to deal with it, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be patient: I shall try to satisfy him on the matter in due course, as I wish to comment further on the highly prestigious public schools.<br><br>
The admission procedure of such schools, if they became grant maintained, would have to accord with the wishes of the funding authority. That would have to be negotiated. In short, those schools would lose their independence—the very thing that they prize most highly. Obtaining grant-maintained status would mean, in effect, that such public schools would cease to be independent schools.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) asked about small private schools regarding grant-maintained status as a way of surviving when they did not really deserve to. Such cases would have to be dealt with by the funding council. I presume that that council would consider the local situation, and work out, with the co-operation of the LEA, the number of school places needed locally. If it perceived that such a school was not making a relevant contribution to education in its area, I expect that the funding council would reject its application to enter the maintained sector. The council could only accept applications from such schools if it believed that they were fulfilling a need—at least, I trust that that is what would happen. I cannot believe that the funding council would behave irresponsibly and allow schools to flood into the maintained sector. A school would need to show its relevance in terms of places, and that it offered something unique or at least special in its curriculum.<br><br>
I have tried to deal with objections to amendment No. 247. No doubt others will be raised to the proposal that schools that are currently independent should be allowed to enter the maintained sector. However, that proposal would have advantages as well as a moral Tightness. Anyone who visits a Rudolph Steiner school will be deeply impressed and even moved by the experience, they are wonderful places. Ample evidence of their excellence exists. Educationists and others have written glowing reports about them.<br><br>
If one visits a Steiner school, one is first impressed by the emphasis on the visual arts, which suffuses it. Painting is evident everywhere. Pupils make their own textbooks—that is a highly motivating activity. Music is also prominent in those schools. That is balanced by special attention to science and technology. The link that Steiner schools establish between teaching science and teaching the visual arts is especially striking and it is philosophically justified. It inculcates into pupils a sense of awe and wonder at the natural world. That should be one of the main aims of education. It is effectively achieved by teaching science with reference to the visual arts.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
Steiner schools have made a significant contribution to the development of curricula over decades. Froebel, Montessori and Steiner curricula have been influential. They have indirectly influenced the national curriculum. Their success in pupils' personal development has been extraordinary. They have provided rich educational and social experiences. Their high academic attainment is unquestioned. It cannot, therefore, be right to exclude them from the maintained sector. Their admissions policies are non-selective and admission does not depend on the ability to pay fees. They should not have to struggle to raise funds. Their teachers should not be paid salaries that are far lower than those of teachers in conventional schools. Low salaries lead to a high turn over of staff. It is difficult to recruit teachers who have been conventionally trained or who are not part of the international Steiner network. Consequently, in my constituency, such schools experience difficulty in recruiting teachers of Welsh, although they are keen to do so. I should like that to happen and Welsh-medium education to be available at such schools.<br><br>
The inclusion of Steiner schools in the maintained sector would enable greater interaction with conventional schools and facilitate the movement of staff between different sorts of school. That would be beneficial. There are plans to introduce a Steiner component into teacher training courses at the Roehampton institute and the university of Plymouth.<br><br>
It is not right for Britain to be out of step with many countries where Steiner education receives public funding, for example European Community countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Holland, Germany and France. Other countries that publicly fund Steiner schools include Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Israel, and, perhaps more surprisingly, Russia, Romania and other eastern European countries.<br><br>
A 1984 EC resolution on freedom of education says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Freely established schools, which meet the objective criteria established by law for the award of specific qualifications shall be recognised by the State; they shall award the same qualifications as State schools … In accordance with the right of freedom of education, Member States shall be required to provide the financial means whereby this right be exercised in practice, and to make the necessary public grants to enable schools to carry out their tasks and fulfil their duties under the same conditions as in corresponding State establishments."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members know my view on the Bill in general. Grant-maintained status provides a means to fulfil the spirit of the EC resolution.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that Steiner schools should operate under the same conditions as the maintained schools. How would that apply for inspection? We are just coming to a debate on quality control to which the issue is germane. I am not sure how, given the different system of education, the existing state or local networks, or even the independent networks that may be established, would be equipped or trained to adjudge the quality of education in those schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that difficulty can be overcome. I am talking about, not a different system, but bringing particular schools into the system, which would create links with other schools and require the inspectorate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
to understand the Steiner curriculum and enable, eventually, its members to be educated in Steiner methods. The current development of training Steiner teachers in "conventional" education departments and institutes shows how that could happen. Certain provisions would have to be made and inspectors would have to possess a sensitive understanding of the nature of the Steiner curriculum. I imagine that many would be already trained educationists and know of alternative curricular.<br><br>
Grant-maintained status provides a means to fulfil the spirit of the EC resolution, but within the strict conditions of the amendment. If "choice and diversity" is not about enabling such an enlightened development in the state system as I am proposing to take place, I do not know what it is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everyone listening to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) must be impressed by the vision and experience that he demonstrated when talking about the different types of school. Hon. Members from the Principality are also aware of the hon. Gentleman's experience in education over many years and his deep commitment, which is exemplified by his assiduous attendance in Committee over the past few months. His points about the Rudolph Steiner schools were interesting. All of us would benefit from visiting such schools and examining their curricular. I think that we agree also that the national curriculum is too rigid, that there is a place for alternative curricular and that that of the Steiner schools is probably the best example.<br><br>
We must accept the hon. Gentleman's point about those schools being substantially different from private, independent or public schools. His reference to the international aspect of the schools is also very important. However, Labour Members find the amendment unacceptable and we shall not support it. The reason is simple: by no stretch of the imagination do we disagree with what the Steiner schools do, nor do we disagree with some form of public funding for those schools. Our difficulty is the means by which funding is provided.<br><br>
The whole basis of Labour Members' opposition to the Bill is that we do not like the idea of grant-maintained schools. We do not like the idea of funding councils in England or in Wales. We believe them to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanics of the delivery of our education system. If it is bad news for LEA schools to become grant maintained, it would be equally bad news for Rudolph Steiner schools. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North consider tabling an amendment which would encourage some method of public funding for those schools and avoid the necessity of using a system to which the Labour party is diametrically opposed and which is the purpose of the Bill? He may be interested in my remarks on future regional and national government in Britain. I should have thought that regional government in England, an Assembly in Wales and a Parliament in Scotland would be the sort of governmental institutions which could be used to fund schools such as the Rudolph Steiner schools. When a Welsh Assembly is established in the next decade, that is the particular institution to which those schools could turn.<br><br>
Meanwhile, pressure should be put on the Government to introduce proper public funding which could allow schools to avoid seeking grant-maintained status. It would also avoid the use of quangos, to which my hon. Friend the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North and I are deeply opposed, in both England and Wales. Therefore, although we agree with much of what my hon. Friend has said, we are reluctantly unable to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North for his acknowledgement of the principles of choice and diversity which are the foundation of our White Paper. I also welcome the hon. Gentleman's typically generous acceptance of the principle of grant-maintained schools, which is in stark contrast to the mean-minded attitude that we have come to expect from other Opposition Members, regrettably reinforced by the mercifully brief comments of the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy).<br><br>
However passionate the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North feels about this matter and however eloquent his testimony about a particular type of school or education, there are difficulties underlying his remarks. He was typically open and honest with us. He said at the beginning of his remarks that he wanted a way of getting the taxpayer to fund schools which are currently not funded through that means. He wants those schools to plug in to the taxpayer's pocket, and therein lies the difficulty.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then said that if the grant-maintained sector did not exist, we would need to find another way of achieving such funding. The hon. Member for Torfaen has provided such a way. The Labour party has generously committed itself to funding the schools for which the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North was full of praise. We would like to hear a little more detail about that from the Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was aware that I was referring to a system of regional and national government in Wales, Scotland and the regions of England, the introduction of which would provide an ideal opportunity for such funding arrangements to be made. Most importantly, funding would be democratically controlled, unlike the grant-maintained system to which we are opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. gentleman for elaborating. His ideas would mean that we would have additional layers of administration which would spend additional taxpayers' money on the sorts of schools that he mentioned. It will be useful to tease this matter out. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North has his answer. His electorate will have to decide whether they vote for him or for Labour at the next general election to get what he wants. I shall leave it for them to sort out.<br><br>
At least the amendment's ground rules have been set out. Access to funds would be freely available for the kind of schools that the hon. Gentleman described. He was open in saying that the amendment would admit an almost infinite variety of schools to claim on the taxpayer. Generic schools of the kind that he described or schools created by well-meaning, but occasionally eccentric people with a different view of education would be given the key to the taxpayers' Aladdin's cave, provided they could negotiate with the proposed school curriculum and assessment authority and justify their curricula, even if they were a little eccentric and rather different from the national curriculum. Assessment methods would also have to be justified. Such schools could then proceed with being funded by the taxpayer rather than continue on the basis on which they were established.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
There are a number of difficulties with the amendment. I shall deal with the prosaic problems and then deal briefly, but I hope adequately, with the hon. Gentleman's specific points about the curriculum. The practical difficulty is that we would have to insist on basic qualifications before anyone was given the keys to the taxpayers' Aladdin's cave. The qualifications are a little boring, but essential. The funding agency for schools will have to be satisfied with an application, as it will be responsible for presiding over and funding the growing grant-maintained sector. A need for the taxpayer to provide additional school places in a locality's grant-maintained sector would need to be identified and proven. The straightforward but important requirement that premises are suitable would have to be met.<br><br>
The requirement to prove the need for the taxpayer to provide additional places is probably the most difficult to meet and a number of recent applications by promoters to set up schools have foundered on it. Even if it were met, a school must also meet the key requirement of providing the national curriculum. The hon. Gentleman ingeniously pleaded to my sensibilities about choice and diversity. He asked, "Why must we have this rather boringly uniform national curriculum inflicted on our children when there could be such a marvellous and rich variety of provision if only we were a little more imaginative?" I shall confess to the Committee that he made a mistake and hope that my confession does not go any further.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman does not know me as well as other members of the Committee. He tried to appeal to me on the basis of what he called an open, enlightened and liberal society. I have to tell him that such words are not the ones to use when trying to appeal to my better nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have chosen other adjectives if I had known that. Perhaps the Minister would like to suggest some to me, or ask <i>Hansard to</i> replace the ones that I used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am far too modest to suggest adjectives which would suitably be applied to me, although I have previously let it slip that statesman is one which appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister now thinks that he is a statesman. He said that one of the tests to decide whether taxpayers' money should be used for education is whether the criteria of the national curriculum are fulfilled. Will he admit to the Committee that taxpayers' money is used for the assisted places scheme, which puts pupils into a system that does not have to adhere to the national curriculum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I freely accept that. The assisted places scheme was designed for a different purpose. It allows a small but significant number of young people from families who could not otherwise afford it to receive their education in the independent sector. We have made that commitment in successive Conservative party election manifestos, and I am pleased to stand by it.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister acknowledges that to use the national curriculum as a criterion for spending taxpayers' money does not hold water.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does. The vast bulk of children—as Opposition Members repeatedly remind us—are educated in the maintained sector. The assisted places scheme is a different matter altogether. The Government decided to allow a limited amount of taxpayer support for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 845</span>
a limited number of young people whose families want them to enjoy the benefits of the independent sector. If schools wish to take advantage of the assisted places scheme they are free to approach my Department and ask to be included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Using taxpayers' money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it involves taxpayers' money. I know what is and what is not taxpayers' money—a distinction that usually escapes Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Assisted places have existed for 30 years or more including under previous Labour Administrations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The assisted places scheme was introduced in the Education Act 1981.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not have been called "assisted places", but the principle of the public sector funding pupils from homes that could not afford to do so has been in existence for many years, including under previous Labour Administrations. I was a recipient of such a place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment, which is not about assisted places. The Minister is replying to the debate on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither is the amendment about direct-grant schools, which may have been in the minds of some members of the Committee. We shall move on before we get too bogged down in history because I want to answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North.<br><br>
It was spelt out clearly in the White Paper that the choice and diversity that we want to encourage in the maintained state education system rests to a large extent on providing a guarantee to parents and to pupils that they will enjoy the benefits of the framework of the national curriculum. On another occasion we can debate whether the scope and content of that curriculum is appropriate. Our approach has always been that inevitably there will be scope for reviewing the national curriculum. The National Curriculum Council presently does so and the school curriculum and assessment authority will do so in the future.<br><br>
We attach great importance to the principle of the national curriculum and to the guarantee to all young people that they will be entitled to receive the benefits of the national curriculum regardless of which taxpayer-funded schools they attend. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but he says that the curriculum will be a matter for negotiation between each group of schools and the school curriculum and assessment authority and that there could be further negotiation on the method or standards of assessment. That would open up the possibility of a variety of provision, which would be so removed from the principle of the national curriculum that it would not only be difficult to contain or control, but would be unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke about negotiation, I did not mean negotiating the curriculum. I was asking whether an alternative curriculum was compatible with the national curriculum and whether it would be a matter for discussion. Related to that, there may be negotiation in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
sense that the school curriculum and assessment authority might make certain stipulations and thus concessions. That is the sort of negotiation that I meant.<br><br>
The issue is determining whether a curriculum is compatible with the national curriculum. It is not a matter of negotiating away details of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I do not want to get bogged down in semantics. What the hon. Gentleman described is what I would normally call a process of negotiation. He said enough, in eloquently describing the difference in approach at the schools he mentioned, to show that they depart considerably from the national curriculum and from the principles of our current approach to assessment. The difficulty with the amendment is that it offers a difference of approach. The hon. Gentleman is asking us to accept a degree of difference and variety—a potentially unlimited number of different philosophies, approaches and principles in an unlimited variety of schools. As I said earlier, there is a problem about allowing a gateway to be open to allow such schools into the grant-maintained sector. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both sides of the Committee are reluctant, for different reasons, for that type of school to be given grant-maintained status, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen made clear. He gave an example of how taxpayers' money could be made available for the type of education curriculum described by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North. It is important that we acknowledge that some children need a different form of teaching and structure from children in other schools.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin. My hon. Friend's point was that the Minister has accepted that outside the maintained sector, public money could be made available for a different type of education, the assisted places scheme, which was introduced by the Conservatives. Does the Minister accept that in some way that has not been specified in the Committee the Government would be prepared to make public money available for the type of curriculum described by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may almost agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot agree with the hon. Lady. The direct answer to her question is, no, for the reasons that I have tried to articulate.<br><br>
We believe that for a school to become grant maintained and to receive funding from the taxpayer, it will have to fulfil the fundamental criteria that I mentioned earlier. We believe, too, that the curriculum should, in that respect, be sacrosanct. I am intrigued that we are beginning to see the development of something for which Conservative members of the Committee have been waiting for 80 or 90 hours. There is a teasing hint from the hon. Lady of what Labour party education policy might be. I hope that as time passes we may hear more of it. The hon. Member for Torfaen did a little bit of teasing, too. They obviously have a secret that they are just about ready to reveal to us. They seem to be saying that they believe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
that taxpayers' money should be much more freely available. The Labour party seem to be saying that they do not regard the curriculum as monolithic, and that they are now more prepared to negotiate on it.<br><br>
It is possible that the type of school that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North described would fit in well in the Labour party's scheme of education. That is an interesting thought and I hope that it will be developed later because it has important implications for the education budget, for example, and for the form and shape of education as it might be under a Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are entering an interesting debate about the curriculum and I know that you, Mr. Martin, will call us to order if we extend it too much. I fully appreciate and understand the point raised about the assisted places scheme; I do not reject it because those who use the assisted places scheme do not have to abide by the national curriculum. [HON. MEMBERS: "We know that."] Yes, I accept that that point is understood. However, the schools that operate in the assisted places scheme—I have experience of more than one of them—abide by the national curriculum. Therefore, it is wrong to make too much of the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing facts to our assistance. It is always a refreshing change to get facts injected in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will remember that the fictitious character, renowned for his emphasis on facts, was called Mr. Gradgrind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do. If that is the type of appellation that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North is giving me, I shall have to think about it, but, I do not feel in any way insulted.<br><br>
I have covered the essentials of the case that the hon. Gentleman put with such eloquence and passion. For that reason, I regret that I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment. I believe that he has raised such fundamental questions about the nature of the grant-maintained sector and of the national curriculum that it would be very difficult for anyone in my position to accept the amendment in the way in which it is worded and its implications. I hope that he will understand my reasons, for asking the Committee, with some regret, to reject the hon. Gentleman's amendment. In that way we shall keep intact the concept of the grant-maintained sector that I have developed with the Committee and the integrity of the national curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I have a minute to reply, Mr. Martin? [HON. MEMBERS: "The hon. Gentleman has until 10 o'clock"] Well, that is okay then. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be the microphone system, but I am having difficulty hearing the hon. Member, not because of him but because of the conversation taking place around him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I have not heard anything that convinces me that my amendment was misguided. I have also had the feeling, as I have on at least one other occasion in the Committee, that I have been used as a political football. I did not intend that the amendment should become a topic of confrontation between both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
I appreciated very much the remarks of the hon. Member for Torfaen and his general support for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
principle of the amendment. However, it is not my intention to challenge the integrity of the national curriculum, as I went to some lengths to make clear. I agree that the national curriculum is too prescriptive and that it could do with some internal variation. It is perfectly possible to protect the integrity of the national curriculum while at the same time making specific provision for other elements, but the rigidity of the national curriculum was not my concern this evening. I recognise that the Government wish to maintain that curriculum in a great number of schools.<br><br>
9.30 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen said that he could not support the amendment as it stands. I anticipated that there would be weaknesses in the amendment's wording and I would be happy to listen to suggestions as to how it might be tightened and improved so that it might reappear in another place in a slightly different form. However, the hon. Member for Torfaen accepted that such schools should be able to receive public funding. I was searching for a mechanism to enable them to do so, and grant-maintained status seemed appropriate.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Torfaen, I too have deep reservations about the funding agency and funding councils. I have spoken against them in this Committee and suggested that there should be some movement towards democratising them. I was delighted with the hon. Gentleman's commitment to the establishment of what he called a Welsh assembly and a Scottish Parliament. I should be interested to hear a definition of the difference between an assembly and a parliament. My understanding is that a parliament is where people talk and an assembly is where they meet. The real question is about what power such places have. However, as far as quangos relate to the amendment, it is clear that a democratic Welsh Assembly or Parliament would inherit, at least in part, the powers of the quangos and would democratise the decision-making process in Wales. There is no contradiction between developing schools in the way that I have described, in the recognition that the funding council will exist, and then allowing a Welsh Parliament to take over responsibility for funding when the time comes for a more democratic system of government.<br><br>
I was interested to note the Under-Secretary's objection to schools that are presently independent receiving public funding and, as he put it, finding their way into the taxpayers' pocket. Parents who send their children to such schools are taxpayers: they are not tax avoiders. The question of whether the establishment of such schools would damage the survival prospects of other schools would have to be examined. However, the Bill provides for the establishment of new grant-maintained schools by the funding council. Such schools would have promoters and even sponsors. Therefore, I take it that the Government foresee that additional schools will enter the scene. Moreover, city technology colleges are also additional to the usual provision of schools and are intended to offer a particular curriculum and educational regime, so I do not consider that the objection to the amendment is satisfactory. It is clear that the decision to give a school the go-ahead to enter the maintained sector would have to take into account its effect on neighbouring schools. I am pleased that the Minister recognises that because it will have an effect when additional schools are proposed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
I do not accept that my recommendations would lead to an infinite variety or shapeless mass of curricular. Naturally, the guidelines would be drawn by the school curriculum and assessment authority and would receive the Secretary of State's sanction. There would have to be some formula to ensure that only schools with their own coherent curriculum and a proven track record of standards would be able to obtain funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification although it leads to a sort of logical and practical difficulty. If only schools with a proven track record were allowed to break into the system, many people with good ideas and worthy concepts, or groups that got together with new ideas about education, could be precluded from establishing schools.<br><br>
If we were to construct a system that excluded too many varieties of school, we might defeat the hon. Gentleman's objectives. One other concern about the hon. Gentleman's amendment is that it is unclear whether he had in mind—as I believe—only well-established, large groups of schools or whether his concept would allow a single school to gain entry to the grant-maintained sector through the route that he described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why a single school should not gain entry in the way that I described. Nevertheless, an assessment authority would need convincing that a school that was to receive public funding could prove that it maintained a satisfactory pattern of education. Well-established schools would obviously be better placed to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's argument that one should judge schools on the basis of their standards rather than their curriculum. I have always thought that the national curriculum was a means to an end rather than an end in itself. However, I understand my hon. Friend the Minister's argument that we would reach the thin end of the wedge if we said that individual schools could apply successfully for funding, through grant-maintained status, thereby proving—</span></p>
