GRANTS TO FUNDING AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed [24 November],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to a letter that I sent to the Under-Secretary of State for Schools a few days ago, to which I have still to receive a reply. As the letter is directly relevant to the clause, I will read part of it in which I raised an issue that had been discussed in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is difficult for the hon. Gentleman to make himself heard against the general murmur of conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. In my letter, I said that I was confused following an exchange in Committee during a discussion of amendments Nos. 53, 59 and 18, which is recorded in columns 68 to 83 of the <i>Official Report.</i> I wrote.
<br><blockquote><p>"You referred at some length to the publication 'Non-departmental public bodies: A Guide for Departments' and you asserted that this 'document so comprehensively covers the intention of the amendments that they would be redundant'. I am puzzled about the manner in which the provisions of this document bind the new NDPB."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that that document would be vital for funding authorities. If that is so, may I draw attention to paragraphs 5.8.1 and 5.8.2 of the document, and press the Minister to reassure us that funding authorities will be bound by it? Will he explain how? I should like him also to respond to the matters raised by the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) in our discussion on clause 1 and at our previous sitting by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice).
<br><blockquote><p>Paragraph 5.8.1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most executive NDPBs will be financed by a grant-in-aid. This form of financing, as opposed to the payment of a grant, is most appropriate where the Government has decided, subject to Parliamentary and essential Departmental controls, that the recipient body should operate at arm's length."</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
Can the Minister clarify whether the grant will be a grant-in-aid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that confirmation. Had it not been so, you, Sir John, might have ruled my contribution out of order. I should also like clarification that the terms and conditions in clause 4 are separate from, and additional to, the powers and directions in clause 6. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to clarify that also, as that may help the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer, I believe, is that clause 4 is essentially a financial provision while clause 6 covers a much wider area of activity, but the hon. Gentleman is correct.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful. I assume that the terms and conditions mentioned in clause 4 will be given in a financial memorandum issued by the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Education who, in this context, will act as the accounting officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's interventions as they assure me that the points that I am about to raise will be in order. When the Minister sums up, will he clarify also whether those terms and conditions will be made public?<br><br>
In the light of the Minister's responses, I shall explore the subject of potential underspending. In assessing the annual amount of grant-in-aid given by the vote, I need to know how the figures will be calculated because we need confirmation of the number of grant-maintained schools that will be included in that vote. Potentially, there are two ways in which to calculate that number. First, we can assume that the number of schools will be the baseline number that exist in a given year. If that is so, it will be necessary for the Department to seek extra grant to pay for additional grant-maintained schools that may be created in that year. However, if the calculation is not based on those baseline numbers, a series of assumptions will be required about the likely number of such schools.<br><br>
Estimates of those assumptions will be heeded. There are also two ways of doing that. One can either be very cautious or highly political and base the results on the rather extravagant assumptions about the number of grant-maintained schools that are likely to be created the following year. The Secretary of State, in a written answer to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey)—at columns 894–5 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 12 November—gave the likely number of grant-maintained schools in the coming few years. Many of us think that the estimates are wildly optimistic. Nevertheless, they may be used as the basis for calculating the size of the grant-in-aid covered by the vote. If they are, and they are wildly optimistic, a significant problem may arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the estimates are wildly optimistic. My best advice to him is to wait and see. In the coming two or three months, the applications for grant-maintained schools will increase greatly. He may then wish to reconsider the drift of his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, but I remind the hon. Gentleman of the wildly optimistic claims made by the previous Prime Minister about the number of grant-maintained schools expected by 1992. Those estimates have not been substantiated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of my memory, if for nobody else's, will the hon. Gentleman give us the figures that were quoted by my right hon. and noble Friend, Baroness Thatcher?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be more than happy to check the <i>Official Report.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the general election, Grant-Maintained Schools Ltd. stated that 2,000 schools would immediately request opt-out status. The then Secretary of State for Education said that there would be an avalanche of requests from schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that we are moving slightly away from the point. In answer to the hon. Member for Rugby
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0242">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
and Kenilworth, I understand that the estimate given by Baroness Thatcher is far in excess of the present figures. The <i>Official Report</i> will, no doubt, have those figures; we shall have an opportunity to check them before the next sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. Back in 1988, the former Prime Minister—now Baroness Thatcher—said that by the next election, which was in April 1992, half the schools would be grant maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That information is helpful, but is irrelevant to clause 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the figures can be checked in the <i>Official Report.</i><br><br>
Many of us are concerned about the size of the estimates. If they prove to be wildly optimistic, underspending is a real possibility. We are concerned about what will happen to that money.<br><br>
By his earlier interventions, the Minister made clear that the funding authorities will be bound to the document, "Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments." Paragraph 5.8.2 makes clear what will happen to underspends in excess of 2 per cent. Unless special arrangements have been made, the underspends will be returned to the Treasury. If the calculation for the amount of money within the vote for the funding authorities to distribute to grant-maintained schools is based on a wildly exaggerated estimate of the number of such schools, there will be an underspend. If that underspend is in excess of 2 per cent., it will be returned to the Treasury. That money will be taken out of the education vote, returned to the Treasury and lost for use in education.<br><br>
Even more importantly, that money will have been taken from the local education authorities for use in grant-maintained schools. It cannot then be returned to LEAs. I seek assurance from the Minister that my description of the mechanism is correct. I should also like to know how the number of grant-maintained schools is involved in the calculation of the vote—will it be based on the actual numbers of GM schools at the start of each financial year? If so, does the Department for Education intend to apply for extra grant for new GM schools? If it is to be based on estimates, will the Minister say how those estimates will be calculated? Will the Minister assure us that, if there is an underspend, he will do everything possible, within the terms of paragraph 5.8.2, to seek mechanisms by which the underspend can be returned to the LEAs from whom that money had been taken in the first instance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 will give the Secretary of State powers connected with the funding to be made available to the authorities. I want to question the Minister briefly—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Take as long as you like.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to be brief. My point relates to a skirmish during questions in an earlier debate about the explanatory notes that help us to understand what the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
Bill intends. The status of the funding agencies in England and Wales will depend upon how the funding mechanisms work. The introductory note on clause 1 states in paragraph 1 that the funding agency in England will be a statutory non-departmental public body. Paragraph 1 of the introductory note on clause 2 makes no reference to whether the schools funding council for Wales will be an NDPB. Paragraph 2(1), however, states that the schools funding council for Wales will be a body corporate. Paragraph 2(1) of the notes on clause 1 merely states that the funding agency for schools will be established, it does not state that it will be a body corporate. Will the Minister make it clear that the different wording in the explanatory notes to clauses 1 and 2 does not mean that the two bodies are different legal entities? I want to be certain that they will both be statutory NDPBs, which will operate under the same rules. Will the Minister confirm that that is so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much. I am pleased that that is out of the way; I was not certain about it. I realise that the civil servants may have tried to write the notes in a slightly different way so as to maintain our interest.<br><br>
During the debate on clause 4, reference has been made to the vague and general way in which it is drafted. It gives the Secretary of State powers to make grants to any funding authority
<br><blockquote><p>"of such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine".</p></blockquote>
We do not have much flesh to put on that skeleton, apart from our experience of how grant-maintained schools are funded. There has been a change in how they are funded but until the consultation paper on the common funding formula is available, we cannot be certain how clause 4 will operate.<br><br>
We already know that, in the short-term, the rules operate in favour of the grant-maintained sector in terms of their set-up costs. Furthermore, changes to the standard 16 per cent. addition in 1991 have given grant-maintained secondary schools an advantage over all LEA schools, but especially over primary schools. The 16 per cent. addition was based on an assumption about the average cost of services provided by local authorities from the central funding for schools. Those services are called on more by primary rather than by secondary schools, which has given grant-maintained secondary schools an additional advantage.<br><br>
How can a local authority with very few grant-maintained schools reduce its central funding in relation, pro rata, to the additional money that goes to the grant-maintained schools? There is an impact on local authorities, but, because it is relatively small, they find it difficult to reduce their central costs. However, funds are taken away and we know—because of the way in which the rules are applied in general—that central learning support services are suffering because of the changes in the general funding of schools since 1988. Clause 4, with its general provision for grant-maintained schools, will make the problem more difficult in the short term until the consultation paper on the common funding formula makes clear the Government's thoughts for the future. As has already been said, the significant implications for schools and local authorities in England depend on whether authorities provide more or less support than what is calculated in the standard spending assessment. The implications for authorities in Wales cannot be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
determined at the moment. Will the Government ensure that no school will suffer when the common funding formula is introduced, even though schools in the same local authority area may be treated less generously when they opt for grant-maintained status?<br><br>
If the Government intend to maintain the high levels of support, there must be an implication for local authority funding. Local authorities that in the past have been generous will be penalised because additional money will be removed to maintain support for the grant-maintained schools to ensure that there are no losers. Will the Minister say whether the funding arrangements, about which the Bill gives no real clue, will mean that some schools will receive reduced levels of funding as a result of the operation of the current rules? Does he intend to protect all those schools in the future, with the concomitant impact on local authority funds?<br><br>
Given that both bodies are to be NDPBs, I wish to refer to the document entitled "Government Accounting" and subtitled "A Guide on Accounting and Financial Procedures for the Use of Government Departments". Section 13·2 of that document is entitled "Circumstances in which Grants are Paid". Paragraph 13.2.1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Payments to outside bodies should be made in the form of grants where a department is required or wishes to maintain detailed control over the expenditure. The normal rules of Vote accounting apply. Cash should not be issued to the recipient body in advance of need; and often payments will not be made until the body itself has incurred the expenditure and claims reimbursement."</p></blockquote>
We can consider that information on two levels. If it applies to the grant-in-aid from the Department for Education to the funding agency, the funding agency will have to spend the money on grant-maintained schools before claiming it from the Government. Perhaps the paragraph means that the funding agency will receive a grant-in-aid, which it will disburse to schools. Will schools not receive the money until they have spent it? Will they receive some money, but not all that they have spent, until their spending has been confirmed?<br><br>
If schools must spend first and be reimbursed later, that policy will affect the way in which those schools will be run. I note that the Minister is discussing that with his officials, which suggests that what I have said is not the case. The rules, therefore, do not apply. I hope the Minister will explain how funding will work as it percolates from the Department for Education and from the Welsh Office to the funding authorities and, finally, to grant-maintained schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been long, sometimes interesting, and occasionally relevant. With your indulgence, Sir John I shall try to answer some points, although many were not relevant to clause 4.<br><br>
Clause 4 empowers the Secretary of State to make grants to funding authorities, subject to terms and conditions that he may determine. It would be surprising if the Bill did not include such a provision. If, as the Opposition suggest, the clause was removed, the funding agency would be unable to function. I presume that that is at the back of their minds. They have tabled no amendments to the clause. That suggests that they have nothing to say about it, but that they oppose it in principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being rather presumptions. The Government could have helped the Committee by providing more detail about the clause. The constructive way for the Government to proceed would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
to explain how the general system outlined in the clause would work, but they want to rush the Bill through. We still await the consultation paper oh the funding formula that the Government will use to effect clause 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for people outside the House to judge whether the Bill is being rushed through. A two-day Second Reading debate is hardly equivalent to "rushing" the Bill through. Our rate of progress does not fit that description.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Minister that he urged the Opposition to take as long as we liked to explain our point of view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a courteous and endlessly patient man. We expect nothing else from Opposition Members. It is for all of us to judge the length and relevance of our contributions. I shall reply to the debate in that spirit.<br><br>
If the funding agency for schools is to fulfil its duty to pay annual grant to grant-maintained schools and to meet its operating costs, self-evidently it must receive a grant from the Secretary of State. That is what the clause is about.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I shall comment on some of the points raised during the debate, starting with that made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and by others who were, I think, overly anxious about over and under payments. It is no more than the general warp and weft of local and central Government. It relates, no more, no less, to the mechanisms for estimating what will be required in the coming year and for making in-year adjustments when the estimates can be proved to be inaccurate. The sums paid to the funding agency for schools will aim to cover the running costs of the agency and the exercise of its functions. The Government must decide on the amount, which will be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny of public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that when Governments allocate money, they do so on an annual basis? There is no mechanism for mid-term readjustment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the overall sum is determined in the usual way as it is in all central and local government departments. We are talking about adjustments within the departmental total. I shall deal with that issue in a moment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath also referred to surplus funds in cases where initial estimates of the growth in grant-maintained school numbers prove to be too high. Naturally, we would not expect there to be such surpluses—certainly not in the sense that the hon. Gentleman suggested—if only because the grant-maintained option is becoming more popular. However, it is right to plan for such eventualities.<br><br>
Surpluses can arise with any NDPB or with any other body. The funding agency for schools will be an NDPB and it will have to work within a framework, reflected in the financial memorandum, which will make provision for dealing with surpluses. In practice, much will depend on how large was the surplus. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would have to consider what additional needs had occurred in other programmes of the work of the FAS and within his Department. That would be the usual process as the year proceeded.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
There are several reasons why surpluses need not be a major issue. We will agree annual estimates for the running costs of the FAS, which can usually be predicted fairly accurately. For the grant provision to schools by the FAS, the position must be considered with respect to each kind of grant. For example, by far the biggest grant will be the annual maintenance grant, which should not be an issue as the costs are covered by LEA funds. If the annual maintenance grant is different from the initial estimates, it will be covered by a balancing adjustment by the DFE with the relevant LEAs. They do not pay the costs of the other grants that grant-maintained schools receive but that is not a major issue in terms of the overall amounts. Transitional and most special purpose grants are paid on pupil number-related formulae. If pupil number estimates are out of line with real growth, it will be noticed fairly early and action can be taken to divert funds to other programmes.<br><br>
Capital grants are allocated to schools that are grant maintained at the start of the year and are not seriously affected by estimated growth later in the year. In several ways and for different reasons, the issue rightly raised by the hon. Member for Bath will not have the effect that he apocalyptically predicted. Such matters can be handled easily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that the largest element is the annual maintenance grant. He said, too, that it would not create problems because the money is taken from LEA funds. In one sense, he is right—that is where the money comes from. But if the estimate is incorrect in a way that I have not assumed that it will be—that is, if it is an underestimate of the number of grant-maintained schools that will come into being in the course of the financial year—will more money be taken away from the local authority in that year? If the estimate is incorrect in the way that I have described, will there be a mechanism to return the money to the local education authority budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman can have it both ways. The Government believe that the mechanisms that will be available to deal with both unders and overs will work satisfactorily. However, because the lead time for the establishment of grant-maintained schools is fairly long, one can predict with some accuracy how many such schools will exist. For example, we know fairly precisely how many grant-maintained schools will exist by April 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be comfortably in excess of 500 and may approach 600. Because we can predict so far ahead, the problems will not be as great as has been suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister say that grant-maintained schools will be funded on the basis of the present LEA arrangements. That may mean that more than £500 million is being overspent, according to the Government's definition, on education in 64 LEAs. Is the Minister giving a commitment, on behalf of the Government, to increase education spending by £500 million? There was no such commitment in the autumn statement. Many Opposition Members would welcome that additional spending.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members would welcome £500 million for almost anything. The problem is how to pay for it, and we dealt with that in the general election last April. I shall answer the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) later, but, given the difficulty of predicting the financial position even a year ahead, it is a little unreasonable of him to invite me to make predictions and give guarantees as to SSAs and relativities. Nor can I forecast the futures of the funding formulae that operate currently or of the common funding formula, on which a consultation document will be issued in December. Such predictions are impossible. We must work now on the basis of the known financial regime. Next year we shall work with the financial regime that applies then, but I cannot begin to predict the situation in 1993–94.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to pick up on the Minister's apparent assurance that those schools will receive the same funding as they receive at present under the LEA regime. The record will show that the Minister did not qualify what he said. I am interested in the qualification that he has now supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is not about funding alone. It is also about the power that the Secretary of State must take to ensure an appropriate measure of financial propriety and accountability. That is why the clause states that the grants to the funding authorities will be subject to "terms and conditions". I stress that the agency must meet those terms and conditions, which do not refer to the level of grant to grant-maintained schools. The terms and conditions for that are dealt with in chapter VI of part II of the Bill, although I shall refer to them in passing when I reply to the debate.<br><br>
The terms and conditions to be attached to payment of grant by the Department for Education to the FAS will be set out in the financial memorandum and other documents. That will more than adequately cover the point about financial propriety and accountability for this NDPB.<br><br>
The agency will be a corporate body that will carry out only the functions given to it by the Bill. It will operate in accordance with guidance and directions issued by the Secretary of State as to the exercise of the functions. These are executive and operational. They will include initially the calculation and payment of grants and, over time, the provision of school places. As a corporate body, the FAS can exercise only functions for which it has statutory cover. The funding agency's actions will thus be closely prescribed and monitored. We shall ensure that it has sound financial management arrangements and that it achieves its objectives efficiently and effectively within available resources.<br><br>
Initially, the agency's main function will be the calculation and payment of grant to grant-maintained schools in accordance with regulations and guidance from the Secretary of State. We shall have the opportunity to debate later the provisions relating to the regulations.<br><br>
The agency will be accountable to the Secretary of Stae, who, like any other member of the Government, is accountable to Parliament. It will be open to hon. Members to table questions and to use all Parliament's well-known procedures and opportunities to hold the Secretary of State accountable: he will have the responsibility of replying.<br><br>
House of Commons Standing Orders provide that departmental Select Committees are entitled to examine
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
the expenditure, administration and policy of the associated public bodies of the Departments concerned. The term "associated public bodies", is not denned in Standing Orders but it is generally accepted that the test is the degree of ministerial responsibility for the body concerned. The FAS more than meets that test.<br><br>
In creating a clear framework for the establishment of the FAS, we seek to strike a balance between enabling the Secretary of State to fulfil his responsibilities to Parliament and giving the FAS some independence. Tight control of the agency will ensure that it carries out its tasks with maximum efficiency. Most importantly, the Secretary of State must, with the Treasury, approve the authority's expenditure, as he is resonsible for this public spending.<br><br>
Paragraph 15 of schedule 1 imposes requirements on the FAS in respect of the maintenence of financial records and on the publication of a statement of accounts. It also places a duty on the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine, certify and report on the accounts of the FAS and lay both the statement and his report before the House. I hope that that will allay hon. Members' concerns. The chief executive of the FAS may be summoned to give evidence to the Public Accounts Committee. There is a full panoply of financial accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we are considering an important issue—the efficient use of public resources. We discussed earlier the Opposition's wish that there be in an early clause the requirement that funds be used efficiently and effectively. I was interested in the Minister's comments, which go some way towards reassuring one or two hon. Members. We should like a statutory duty to be imposed on the funding agency.<br><br>
The Minister made much of the fact that the guidance for non-departmental public bodies that was issued in March 1992 mentioned efficient and effective use of Government resources and that therefore it was not necessary to put a specific requirement in the Bill. He mentioned the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 which required the specific duty to make the most efficient use of Government resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be reasonably brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Sir John. The document that covered that Act and the Further Education Funding Agency states that they have a duty to
<br><blockquote><p>"monitor the efficiency and value for money of its activities."</p></blockquote>
There was guidance to cover the Further Education Funding Council with a specific commitment. What is so different about this Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always slightly puzzled that the approach of Opposition Members seems to be that it is in no one's interest that a body such as this should operate efficiently and make effective use of resources. The Government have stressed many times since 1979 their overriding concern with the most effective possible use of taxpayers' money. The suggestion that we are losing interest in that bears little credibility.<br><br>
I am satisfied that the references in the Bill and in the NDPB guide, which, rightly is becoming our bible in Committee, together with the scrutiny that will be applied to my Department and the funding agency for schools through the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General, will meet the hon. Gentleman's anxiety more than adequately.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
11.15 am<br><br>
I assume that I am allowed to mention the Parliamentary Counsel, Sir John. After all, he is an important gentleman. He has advised us that it is bad law if we keep sprinkling across a Bill hopes, aspirations, expectations and nice and good things and motherhood generally, that it makes for much better legislation if we keep the provisions of a Bill to a lean, effective minimum. Therefore, if from time to time I ask the Committee to reject amendments that express sentiments to which all of us would probably subscribe, it is for the important reason that it is not regarded as being a good use of statute to make declamatory or declaratory statements over and over again when the subjects involved can be covered adequately in another way. I hope that that helps the Committee. I shall ask that all amendments be looked at in that light.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that advice from the Parliamentary Counsel, I wonder who drafted the Further and Higher Education Bill. Will the Minister confirm that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the National Audit Office will be responsible for auditing the funding agency's books?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can confirm that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the NDPB guide for Departments has become a bible on this matter so it is worth pressing him further. Chapter 8.2 relates to financial management. It states
<br><blockquote><p>"Aims can be communicated formally on setting up an NDPB through:
<ol>
<li>legislation for the NDPB's specific functions;</li>
<li>Royal Charter;</li>
<li>a Memorandum and Articles of Association (for a Companies Act company).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The mention of legislation for specific functions would make it in order for us to follow the example set in the Higher and Further Education Act. The Minister seems to think that our small request on this point is the equivalent of having to swallow a whale when we are asking for a gnat or a midge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether whales consume gnats or midges. Opposition Members are not asking for anything under clause 4: we are debating whether the clause should stand part. I shall shortly ask the Committee to support the clause. I am unsure what point the hon. Gentleman was making in that context. Unless you rule me out of order, Sir John, I shall not pursue it.<br><br>
Clause 6 ensures that the Secretary of State has the power to issue directions to the FAS about the exercise of its functions. It also provides for sections 68 and 99 of the Education Act 1944—to which Opposition Members are so wedded—to apply to the agency. Thus, if the agency were found to be acting unreasonably or in default of its duty, the Secretary of State would also have power, without prejudice to his general power, to issue directives relating specifically to those actions.<br><br>
Some confusion seems to have arisen over a matter that has exercised many hon. Members who have spoken—the relative funding of grant-maintained and LEA-maintained schools. Some hon. Members seem to think that it would be fair for a grant-maintained school to have responsibilities extra to those of LEA schools yet have no share of the money that LEAs spend on meeting responsibility for their own schools. That is how I interpreted some comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone has said that.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman refutes that. If I have misunderstood, I am grateful for his clarification. Grant-maintained schools receive their main running costs in the form of an annual maintenance grant. That is calculated primarily on the basis of LEA budget information and local management schemes. The total is then recovered from the relevant LEA, a point to which I shall return later. The precise arrangements for calculating AMG are reviewed each year, and I can inform the Committee that a consultation paper setting out proposals for arrangements in 1993–94 was issued on Tuesday and that copies were placed in the Library. Those are our latest proposals, which attempt to look forward to the next financial year. We shall, if necessary, try to refine the method of payment in order to meet some of the points made by the Opposition.<br><br>
Those financial arrangements each year have retained a clear link with local authority funding decisions. The Opposition have criticised the fact that one element of the link is the percentage addition that grant-maintained schools receive over and above LMS.<br><br>
Those additional moneys are based on central spending by LEAs themselves. All we are doing for grant-maintained schools through the percentage addition is giving them a cash sum in place of what LEAs spend centrally on their own schools. Those moneys pay for a wide variety of items, ranging from structural repairs to payroll services.<br><br>
We strive to ensure that the calculations are fair and objective. They are made under regulations laid before the House each year by the Secretary of State. This will continue to be the case under clause 71. Parliament will be able to scrutinise what the Secretary of State has put in the regulations. The FAS will administer the legal provisions; they will not decide them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government were making every effort to link GM spending with local authority spending on schools. He mentioned the 16 per cent. addition. Secondary schools do not use the local authority central support services as much as primary schools. It is unfair to the primary sector to give a 16 per cent. addition to secondary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consultation document covers such matters. We do not believe that the issues are set in concrete—change will occur. The proportion of grant-maintained schools varies from one authority to another; the pattern of primary distribution of expenditure also varies, even across LEAs. We must be sensitive to variations. The consultation document and the document that we shall publish soon on the common funding formula will try to cover those points.<br><br>
Our proposals for AMG in 1993–94 are now with LEAs and grant-maintained schools for consultation. The closing date for comments is 7 January next year. Ministers aim to make final decisions as early as possible in the light of the consultations. Revised regulations will be laid before the House to come into force no later than 1 Aril next year.<br><br>
I was also asked by hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) about the consultation document on the common funding formula. It will be produced before Christmas. It will set out how we might fund grant-maintained schools when the link with LEA decisions can no longer form a reliable or satisfactory basis for funding allocations. The document will begin a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
process of consultation that will become refined and will develop as 1993 progreses. By the time the Bill has Royal Assent, we shall have a working model of the CFF.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that information. Does not he think that it would be more helpful to the Committee and to Parliament if the Government, having consulted widely on the common funding formula, made their final views available before the Bill was enacted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not asking me to hurry the consultation process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Slow down the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is a matter for him. It is not for me to make such suggestions—not yet, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Byers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of discussing the consultation document. The Minister's comment was important because he seems to be moving away from the White Paper, which stated that there would be a link with the LEAs' education funding assessment and the formula. He seems to be saying that the Government are considering the link being broken as the GM sector grows. That is an important move from the White Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must wait a few more weeks until the consultation document is published. There may be no secondary schools left under LEA control because they have all opted out. Consequently, it will be rather difficult to link the funding of the grant-maintained schools to a sector that no longer exists. The rather obvious reason why we wish to pursue the common-funding formula approach is that it gives us an answer to that conundrum. The consultation document, which will be available shortly, aims to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the points that I raised in my contribution to the debate on this clause was about the LEAs delegating more of their budgets into the local management of schools. The existing grant-maintained schools receive both the 16 per cent. added-on costs for the central services provided by the LEA and an increase because of the delegation in LEA budgets. Will the document address that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those are precisely the matters that were addressed in the most recent consultation document and will be addressed in the one to come, to meet the changes and circumstances that the Opposition have pointed out.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee and I shall concentrate on some of the more specific points raised by the Opposition as quickly as possible. A recurring theme of the debate is the effects of the grant-maintained funding arrangements on some of the services hitherto provided exclusively by local education authorities. One example was home-to-school transport, which I think was raised by the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) and some of his hon. Friends. Opposition hon. Members will be delighted to hear that section 55 of the Education Act 1944, as amended by section 100 of the Education Reform Act 1988, makes it clear that local education authorities have the same responsibility for funding provision at grant-maintained schools as though those schools were still authority maintained. The calculation of the annual maintenance grant for grant-maintained schools is made net of the money that the local education authority spend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
on home-to-school transport, which remains one of the important continuing LEA responsibilities. I am sure that that reassures many members of the Committee.<br><br>
The same point applies to other services provided by LEAs, including the educational psychology service—an important service, which has been mentioned by the Opposition. Provision for statemented pupils is another service. Both the money and the duty reside with the local education authority as set out in section 100 of the Education Reform Act 1988 and that fact is reconfirmed by clause 116, which I hope we shall reach in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his affirmation of the way in which he clearly believes that local authorities are able to continue with those important functions and responsibilities. I hope that he accepts that, because of the changes in funding and the pattern of schools, local authorities are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of service for educational psychology and for deaf and hearing-impaired children. I hope that he will request local authorities to provide information about what has happened to those services in the past four years. At a later stage I hope that we will strengthen the powers and responsibilities of local authorities in that respect.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, that is an important point. If that has been happening in the past four years it is not necessarily related to the provisions in the Bill. It may not even be directly related to the number of grant-maintained schools, because if it were, in the areas where there are as yet no grant-maintained schools, none of this would be happening. We should try to find out whether there is a differential effect depending on the number of schools that have become grant-maintained. I do not know whether there is, but I shall let him know if I obtain such information. It would throw light on certain matters.<br><br>
Some hon. Members are anxious about the fact that the costs of AMG are recovered from local funds. The current SSA arrangements are such that LEAs continue to receive grant in respect of pupils in grant-maintained schools. There are some good technical reasons for that, though naturally the matter should be kept under review where the growth in numbers of grant-maintained schools is most pronounced.<br><br>
This system is certainly fair to LEAs. They are in effect paying back money that they do not need, as they no longer have responsibility for schools in their area that have become grant-maintained. If we were to spend new Exchequer funds on AMG, LEAs would receive a windfall; their grant income would remain as before but their spending on schools would fall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I specifically referred to poll tax payers' money that goes into the education service. Will the Minister deal with that point? Will that element of funding—which is in the state system at the moment—be recycled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the community charge will disappear next April. I do not think that the problem arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From April next year the council tax will fund local education provision—it is not funded exclusively by grants from the Exchequer. Contributions came from the revenue support grant, the uniform business rate, and, from 1 April next year, from the council tax, which is collected locally. Will the Minister recycle funds collected through the council tax? It is a very important point.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be an important point, so I will write to the hon. Gentleman with a reply. However, I am not sure that it is relevant to clause 4, but that is for you to decide, Sir John.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Clause 4 states that the Secretary of State will determine the grants given to funding agencies. We have been told that such grant will be paid on current expenditure, which is made up as I have just set out. The Minister must deal with that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not now, but I shall gives the hon. Gentleman an answer later, in so far as it is relevant.<br><br>
I want to turn now to other grants. Special purpose grant (D) mirrors the grants for education support and training paid to LEAs, and SPG(V) reimburses grant-maintained schools for their new additional VAT liability. There is also transition grant which assists LEA schools that are going grant-maintained to prepare themselves for grant maintained status.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members have referred to capital grant. We have made no secret of our intentions to set up grant-maintained schools on a sound basis: it would be wrong to do otherwise. Many schools becoming grant-maintained perceive themselves to have had many years of neglect by their LEAs in terms of capital funding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an important point which he should back up with some evidence. He seems to be saying that many of the schools that have become grant-maintained have done so because they have been neglected by their LEA, which did not invest in the school's infrastructure. Two thirds of the schools are in Conservative-controlled authorities. Is the Minister saying that those authorities failed in their duty to the schools and if so, which does he have in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that many schools believe that their LEA has not given them a fair slice of the cake. It is ironical that those democratically accountable, close-to-the-people, finger-on-the-pulse authorities, which Opposition Members are so fond of characterising, so often fail to satisfy their local schools in their distribution priorities. It is precisely because the allocation of priorities is, understandably, so difficult that the problem arises. I am using a text this morning, so I can easily re-state what I said earlier: many schools becoming grant-maintained perceive themselves to have had many years of neglect by their LEAs in terms of capital funding. That was my point. I hope that Opposition Members will not be over-sensitive about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, he said that many schools that applied for grant-maintained status felt that they had not had their fair share of the LEA's capital allocation. The Minister should back up such statements with facts and figures. How many grant-maintained schools, which applied to opt out and have been granted that status, cited that as one reason for their ratification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an answer to that question—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] I do not carry those figures in my head. I am not omniscient and make no claim to be. I suppose I must repeat my words until hon. Members understand them: many schools becoming grant-maintained perceive themselves to have suffered many years of neglect. That is not a particularly controversial comment, nor does it need to be quantified
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
to have meaning. If the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) wants a list, I shall provide one for him in due course, but I shall certainly not give him a figure from the top of my head because that might mislead the Committee, which is the last thing I want to do.<br><br>
Many LEAs have had wholly inadequate arrangements for maintaining their capital stock. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it clear in a letter that I read to the Committee in our previous sitting that we want to give the maximum assistance to grant-maintained schools so that they will be as successful as possible. One should not imagine that that will be done at the expense of the LEA sector. Ministers take decisions about the allocation of public spending, when considering competing priorities across all public services. They allocate separately to LEAs and to grant-maintained schools. In that sense, less for grant-maintained schools would not necessarily mean more for LEA schools.<br><br>
Opposition Members raised an issue that relates to our letter of 28 August to all grant-maintained schools about the opportunities for capital and other priorities. That letter was written largely in response to requests from schools for guidance. It set out clearly defined priorities in terms of what was likely to qualify for capital grant in 1993–94. We gave them several priorities and mentioned areas in which we thought it would be unwise or unproductive for them to apply. That is neither unhelpful nor negative. We behaved in a perfectly responsible way. Opposition Members are making heavy weather of the matter.<br><br>
I have tried to cover as many of the points made by Opposition Members as possible. Clause 4 is a fundamental part of the Bill, but it is a general provision. We shall come later to the more detailed proposals that underpin the funding agency for schools and its relationship with grant-maintained schools. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that the clause is essential. I ask hon. Members to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not mention what would happen in Wales. There is a substantial difference between the Welsh system of SSAs and the English system, because there are no specific SSAs for education in Wales. Will the Minister of State say what will happen about that, and whether the consultative document to which he referred covers the situation in Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer the hon. Gentleman. He is right to say that the Welsh system is different, in that we do not have SSAs for education in individual local authorities. However, we do have such figures for Wales as a whole. There will be a separate consultation in Wales on a common funding formula, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that, because of the differences between the systems in England and Wales, a different approach will be adopted towards the common funding formula.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there is some provision of public information on the work of the funding authorities and that their work is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The funding authorities will have an important role and, if Ministers succeed in persuading large numbers of schools to opt out of local education authority control, that role will develop further. Therefore, it is important that their work is subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
It is perhaps appropriate to remind the Committee of the citizens charter initiative and to recall that the Prime Minister said in March 1991 that people who depend on public services—that is, patients, passengers, parents, pupils and benefit claimants—must know where they standand what service they have a right to expect. If that right is to be extended to parents and pupils it must also be extended to Parliament, which is the public watchdog. That was confirmed in the Queen's Speech, which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"My Government will give priority to improving public services through the Citizen's Charter which will be at the centre of decision-making. Steps will be taken to apply charter principles throughout the public service."</p></blockquote>
Despite the Minister's scathing remarks, local education authorities are open to public scrutiny. Their meetings and documents are open to scrutiny; they have to undergo full consultation when they change the public service. Local education authorities and the funding authorities should be equally accountable.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I obtained a copy of the citizens charter from the Library this morning. It states that parents and teachers should receive published comparable information about schools in their area, including examination results, truancy rates and the determination of school leavers. The data should be accurate and informative—that is essential for an annual report. I hope that it will also be an important component of the funding agency's annual report.<br><br>

To show the difficulties that the recent publication of examination results caused, I shall quote from an information bulletin issued by Cambridgeshire county council, which is Conservative-controlled. The bulletin is sent to members of the county council, which kindly includes Members of Parliament on its circulation list. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Members may be aware that the Department for Education (DFE) figures contained a number of errors, including listing five of the County's Village Colleges without name and producing inaccurate data for at least 30 schools. The errors arose because the DFE apears not to have taken account of regrading and retake results since the results were first produced by the examination boards. The County's Education Department's own analysis is able to take these into account and therefore gives a more accurate picture."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Bowis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of press reports today, has the Labour party changed its policy on publishing exam results? The Labour party has been hostile to that, but today's papers report that there has been a change of heart and that the Labour party accepts that the publication of exam results is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going wide of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has always supported the use of accurate and informative data. The funding authorities should be accountable and provide accurate and informative data. Inaccurate and uninformative data leads to the sort of furore that occurred recently. That can cause difficulties and distress to schools and parents. The funding agency's annual report should be scrutinised by Parliament.<br><br>
Large sums are being disbursed. If Tory Members are successful in persuading or bribing schools to opt out of LEA control, it could cost billions of pounds of taxpayers' money each year. After the exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend and the Minister, I am still unsure how the money will be collected. Will it come from the council tax, or from central Government funds? I hope that the Minister will clarify that.<br><br>
It is also important to ask how the money is spent. Is it being spent on closing schools or creating new places? Where is it being spent? What is being spent in different regions and on which schools? On what sort of schools is it being spent? Will the funding agency be responsible for opening new voluntary-aided schools, new Catholic schools, new Muslim schools or new Church of England schools? Will we consider the retention and continuation of middle schools, which have fallen out of favour in recent years but which still provide education for many pupils?<br><br>
What estimates of future expenditure needs will the funding agency produce? Will we be given information on future school populations with which the funding agency will estimate future expenditure? The funding agency will have to produce figures for projected school rolls, explain its rationale for closing schools and tell us who it consulted before it did so. Will there be a protocol for school closures? Many LEAs have a protocol which describes fully the people whom it will consult and the stages of the consultation process. They give the results of the consultation before deciding on closure.<br><br>
We want to know when the money is being spent. Why is it being spent on a particular school, in a particular area at a particular point in time? What is the estimate of the backlog of building repairs? The Minister said that some schools perceive that they have been neglected by their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
LEAs. When I was a member of an LEA in Cambridgeshire we estimated the backlog of building repairs in schools after several years of Conservative control was £30 million at 1986 figures. Little progress has been made in the meantime because of the cuts in Government spending and the Government's refusal to allow local authorities to spend money as they wish.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will take note of another important, although technical, point. If 90 per cent. of pupils in an authority were in grant-maintained schools there would no longer be a need for an education committee. The LEAs will continue to have responsibility for special needs education, school transport and the educational psychology service, and they will need resources to collect and provide funding agencies with information to assist effective planning, and to support the interests of the minority of schools in which parents have chosen to stay within the LEA.<br><br>
Another essential part of the annual report should be the pay of the members of the funding agency. Pay is an important matter at the moment. Last week the Minister said that they might receive fees rather than salaries. I was alarmed by that because it may mean that members of the funding agency are to be part time. Will the Minister clarify that point? Even if only 1·5 per cent. of schools became grant-maintained, there would be plenty of work for full-time members.<br><br>
The amount that is paid to members of the funding agency is important. As has been said already, the money may be taken from expenditure that could go directly to schools. We should know how that money is spent and what remuneration members of the funding agency receive.<br><br>
My next point concerns the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, or the ombudsman. If complaints to the funding agency are to be referred to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the general public should know how many complaints the funding agency has received and of what kind. We also need to know how many schools have been taken over by education associations and for what reason: was it lack of money, high levels of deprivation in an area, lack of motivation in staff or pupils, high levels of crime, low expectations, or racial harmony?<br><br>
A great deal of information is required under the new regime. The public has a right to know, and the publication of accurate and meaningful information will ginger up those responsible and motivate better performance.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to draw attention to the document entitled "Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments". I hope that the Minister is listening, as this is important. Appendix B(5) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Typically, legislative provision will cover some or all of the matters listed below."</p></blockquote>
Appendix B(6) lists, from A to K, the powers and provisions which the NDPB typically will cover. The entry designated H specifies:
<br><blockquote><p>"the obligation to inform Parliament of its activities through an annual report".</p></blockquote>
If that is typical, I do not understand why that requirement is not included in the Bill, given that appendix B(6) begins by stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"The statute should define clearly the NDPB's functions, the method of funding"</p></blockquote>
and so on. The amendment would correct the omission of such a provision in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 112, and wish to make a few comments on amendment No. 69. I shall be brief as I am sure that the Minister accepts the fundamental principle that the work of the funding authorities should be subject to parliamentary and public scrutiny. Yesterday in the House, we had a major debate about the citizens charter. I am sure that hon. Members know that the aim of the parents charter was to open up education services to detailed public and parliamentary scrutiny. I hope that the Committee does not dispute the value of that. Conservative Members will know that the Government customarily make available to the public and to Parliament detailed reports on a range of issues. For example, a glossy leaflet describing the Government's proposals accompanied the publication of the White Paper. That was part of the Government's attempt to supply members of the public with information about what they were hoping to do. It was also part of the consultation exercise—inadequate though that was. Other bodies working within the remit of the DFE have also been given clear instructions to make reports available to the public, not just to Parliament. A letter from the Secretary of State to the new HMCI, Professor Sutherland, makes it clear that Ofsted has a remit to publish reports as it wishes.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The principle behind the amendments is not in question. Therefore, the Minister must state any objection to them. Let us suppose that his objection will be the same as before: that the two new bodies will be covered by the guide. The Minister will no doubt cite paragraph 8.1, which states that an NDBP will provide annual reports and accounts. He will point out that although it is not referred to in that paragraph, there will be cross references to earlier sections, especially paragraph 6.6.2, which mentions the chief executive's report, which covers many of the items which we are worried about. The Minister may refer, too, to paragraph 8.6.2. which states that the Department will offer guidance on publicity issues and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Spot on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tells me that I have it spot on.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to state clearly by what mechanism the new funding authorities will be bound by the document. The Minister says that he is keen that those issues should receive public scrutiny and be enacted but how can we be certain that the funding authorities will, ab initio, be bound by the document? The introduction states that the guide provides guidance on the good practice that should be followed in all cases by all executives of NDPBs unless agreed by the Cabinet Office or the Treasury. By itself, that does not, ab initio, give us the assurance that we seek.<br><br>
The Minister must clarify the mechanism by which the two new funding authorities will be bound by the document. If he gives us assurances about the mechanism, I may agree with his view. Without such assurances, I shall have to press him to ensure that public and parliamentary scrutiny is included in the clause. I should like to know whether the parts of the document that relate to publication of information will be covered by the proposal. Is it the Minister's intention to seek charter mark status for the two new funding authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be relatively brief. I would not expect this proposal to be in the Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
because, as the Minister said, we should not expect everything to be spelt out; Bills should be clear and concise. However, I make an urgent appeal to the Minister for clear, simple English in the report. Far too many of the reports that we receive are written with initials of all sorts, which may be very familiar to us—such as the DFE—but they are not necessarily familiar to other people. Concise and clear English is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am enthusiastic about the hon. Gentleman's point. Is he aware of the Plain English campaign, which includes reference to reports produced by civil servants? Does he support that campaign whole-heartedly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to tell the Committee that I have supported it since its inception. I know that the Minister is very careful about what goes out in his name; he ensures that there are no spelling or punctuation mistakes, that the syntax is decent and that the grammar is correct.<br><br>
I must tell the Committee of an experience that shamed me, when I was showing some 16-year-olds around the House. A previous Secretary of State for Education and Science—the current Home Secretary—had had posted a public notice about a debate taking place that day on the Asylum Bill. There, writ large on his behalf, was the word "visa's" with an apostrophe. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members may think it insignificant that our Secretaries of State put up notices that have apostrophes where no apostrophes should exist—that they are incapable of ensuring that notices in their own name go out accurately: the Opposition require a higher rectitude than that. I stood in front of that notice and shielded the reputation of the Home Secretary—I felt that it was not a party-political matter, but a shame to us all that we had allowed him to put it up. My main call is for clarity, directness and decent punctuation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that he wrote most of the White Paper, "Choice and Diversity: A New Framework for Schools". Does my hon. Friend agree with the Secretary of State's spelling of "Doomsday"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having some passing knowledge of Latin, I would, without any shadow of a doubt, spell it, "Domesday", as opposed to the day when the good Lord will come and take us all to his bosom. Perhaps that day of doom may be included in the Bill, but not at the moment.<br><br>
Co-operation between local authorities and the funding authorities will clearly be crucial. Too often in the past, the Department of Education and Science and its Ministers have clashed with local authorities and conflict has arisen between those authorities and central authority. We need to halt that problem if we are to have accurate reports. There are many examples of the way in which inaccurate figures have been issued from the centre—I am referring not to the recent controversy, but to issues such as surplus places. It is important that we get it correct. The way in which the local authorities and the funding agencies work together is crucial for all those children who are controlled by one or the other. It is important for the funding agencies to get a feel of the locality. They should look warmly on the work of local authorities and ensure that their relationship with them is cordial and co-operative. That should not be difficult because there will be relatively few funding agencies, they will be remote and their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
members will be part time, although they will have full time officials working for them. That policy needs to be set in place early on.<br><br>
There is a tendency for reports to be an exercise in self-glorification. Can we ensure that rather than being inward-looking, the reports are outward-looking and meaningful and that they give the information that schools require to analyse their work and to progress? The best of the HMI reports were produced by inspectors who were seen as consultants; they had a fresh look at the work of the school and produced constructive and critical reports. Throughout my career I found their reports useful and a stepping stone to a fresh approach to aims and objectives. I hope that the financial information in the reports will not be separate from the information about the work of the schools; it is an intrinsic part. We are using the money for a purpose; the money is not the purpose itself. Information should be meaningful.<br><br>
I am a little worried about accountability. Some local authorities—not all—and some schools consult the public. That provides important accountability. I worry that accountability will be provided merely by Parliament, which is not able to examine local issues closely. A matter can be raised by a Member of Parliament, but that is not in itself democratic. It is crucial that people examine the report, react to it and speak directly to those responsible.<br><br>
Imagination will be required for such a mechanism to be put into practice. The funding agencies should consider how best to co-operate with local authorities. In many instances the local authority could represent the funding agency locally, especially regarding the report. The relationship between local authorities and the funding agencies will be important, whether fewer than 10 per cent., more than 10 per cent. or even 75 per cent. of schools are grant-maintained. It is crucial that the funding agencies get their act together and produce meaningful and informative reports in concise, decent English.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes, when listening to Conservative Members, I feel that they believe that Labour Members do not want parents or other groups to be given information. That is a simplistic approach to the issue. The Government's efforts to give more information to parents and other groups are not the first. It has been a feature of our democracy and system of government for decades that all of us, in our own way, have tried to give more information to those whom we serve. Both Government and Opposition Members should recognise that, because it is an honourable aim.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The debate is about the nature of that information and how it is presented. It is not a simple issue of making information available to the public. Many questions must be answered if we are to provide more information. As drafted, the Bill does not specify the methodologies and safeguards as it should.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thomson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. Will she confirm that, in principle, she and her party are not against the publication of results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will confirm that we are not against the publication of accurate information and results. The information published recently was readily available to people who went to the schools and tried to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
find out about them. We are against the publication of misleading information, but Conservative Members have a simplistic approach to the publication of results.<br><br>
Much has been made recently of the publication of examination league tables. The difference between the two parties is that basic information, as published by the Government, is misleading because it leaves out so much that is crucial to interpretation of those results. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is not present to explain to us why every statistic published in the league tables about Rugby school in Warwickshire was inaccurate. One statistic especially shows how damaging and misleading it is to publish information that is neither accurate nor comprehensive.<br><br>
The information on special schools in the league tables set a line of noughts next to their names. I remembered that the Secretary of State said that the tables would give parents information about the quality of education in those schools. One could be forgiven for concluding, therefore, that the quality of education offered in special schools was valueless. I do not suppose that any Conservative Member actually believes that. Any hon. Member could tell me that the quality of education in special schools is exceptionally high, that youngsters there improve and achieve a great deal, that teachers work co-operatively with parents and pupils to improve those pupils' life chances and offer them a high standard of education. Such information was not in the league tables. A simplistic approach to the publication of information is misleading and inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady had attended yesterday's sitting of the Select Committee on Education she would have heard the Secretary of State's illuminating response to the points that she has just made. The special schools asked for their results to be published. The Secretary of State promised that he would look into the issue to ensure that information on those schools was given in a proper way and that their results were separated from those of other schools. The point—about which I suspect the hon. Lady and I disagree—is that tens of thousands of parents are better informed as a result of the publication of those results. The Opposition did not want that information to be collected and published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going wide of the amendment again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was listening at the back of the Room when the Secretary of State made his comments about those schools to the Select Committee. I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) that it is not true that all special schools asked to be included in the list. I do not accept that the Government will make a better job of it next year. Damage has been done by what was published this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already said that we cannot debate that matter now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Sir John.<br><br>
Clear and accurate information must be given in annual reports. All those involved in the provision of education must work together to collect it. For example, LEAs throughout the country are in conflict with the Department of Education because they differ about the collection of information on surplus places. On Monday, I went to the Elms Farm school in my constituency. It is threatened with possible merger or closure because it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
thought that it had surplus places. The school does have rooms that are not used by one member of staff to teach 30 or more children. However, the school has community provision, including a creche, which allows parents to visit. I believe that that improves educational standards. It has a room where special needs can be taught in small groups. In another room, information technology can be taught to individuals and small groups. My argument is not that Elms Farm school is right and that the Government are wrong, but there is a clear difference of opinion between schools and LEAs and the Department of Education as to how information about surplus schools should be collected and displayed.<br><br>
That difference causes the same problem as that thrown up by the publication of examination league tables. Far from providing a good foundation for further debate and improvements in the school system, the nature of the information becomes contentious. The purpose of publishing information and annual reports is to enable us to have an agreed basis on which decisions and progress can be made. But the information must be correct: we must agree about its collection and the relevant criteria. We must know who is monitoring whom and who is responsible for verification. Without such agreement, the information will never form a basis for further decisions. It is a travesty. We will never make progress if we cannot agree about the collection and publication of information.<br><br>
The process can appear very bureaucratic. Before last week, most people in schools would have wanted fewer arguments about the collection of information and more help in delivering a high standard of education in the classroom. The publication of the results last week showed that the collection of the information may be bureaucratic, but that the information itself is absolutely crucial as it provides a basis for the subsequent decisions of politicians and bureaucrats. Those decisions affect directly the quality of classroom teaching.<br><br>
The Government have not gone sufficiently far towards determining a common ground for the collection of information, nor for its publication and verification. The amendment would remedy that deficiency. By having an annual report placed before Parliament, we shall open up to public debate the raw figures—such as the Government published last week—and what lies behind their collection. We must know that if we are to use the information accurately. Otherwise, we cannot challenge the figures or carry out meaningful work.<br><br>
I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) said about clear language. We are in danger of being over-simplistic. We cannot boil important information down to a thin soup and expect people to get as much out of it as possible. We should not decide that people can cope only with a little information. The most complex issues can be presented meaningfully to anyone if we make that an objective when we collect and publish information.<br><br>
The amendment would help us to go further in publishing relevant information that is easily intelligible to people who wish to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the threads that has been weaved through the debate is the Bill's effect on democratic accountability. With the introduction of the funding agency for schools and the resultant demise of LEAs, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
genuinely fear that a tier of democratic control of education will disappear. We have tabled several amendments to try to overcome some of the difficulties that the Bill presents to democratic accountability.<br><br>
Amendment No. 112 would make the funding agency more accountable, by ensuring that the funding agency presented an annual report to both Houses. I assume that those reports would be debated by Parliament.<br><br>
The Minister has confirmed that the funding agency for schools will be a non-departmental public body, or a quango. I cannot remember what "quango" stands for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quasi autonomous non-governmental organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a classical reference to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that there is a classical reference to it.<br><br>
It is important to recognise the funding agency for schools as a non-departmental public body. The junior Minister for Schools—or is the Under-Secretary of State for Schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whichever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They change the terms so frequently that it is difficult for a new Member to keep up with old parliamentary traditions, without having to learn new ones.<br><br>
During our proceedings last week, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The agency proposed in clause 1 will have a statutory, independent existence."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 19 November 1992; c. 46.]</p></blockquote>
That is different from a non-departmental public body, which does not have an independent existence. The Comptroller and Auditor General published a report on the review of non-departmental public bodies. The report states that such bodies:
<br><blockquote><p>"will have a role in the processes of national government, incur expenditure on their own account (typically financed at least in part from public funds), and usually carry out prescribed functions within Government guidelines."</p></blockquote>
That report states that an NDPB is an organ of national Government. In the Bill, such an organ is intended to replace an agency of local government. Democratic control is, therefore, essential.<br><br>
The Minister claims that the NDPB—the funding agency for schools—will be accountable in several ways, for example, through the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General, through his report to the Public Accounts Committee. That is financial accountability. The Public Accounts Committee and the agencies that report to it, deal with financial probity and whether money is spent in accordance with Government guidelines. It also considers value for money. It will not examine the wider issues relating to what the funding agency will do. That is why a statutory requirement for an annual report to both Houses of Parliament would be a step in the right direction. As elected representatives of our constituents who see democratic control in our local areas disappearing, we should be able to examine such matters directly in Parliament.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
No doubt the Minister will say that the funding agency, as a NDPB, is accountable to the Secretary of State, and indeed it is. He will also tell us that the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament. Since my election on 9 April,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
I have sat in the Chamber at Prime Minister's Question Time and during Education questions. It may be great theatre, but it is not the most effective way of bringing the Executive to account or scrutinising the conduct of its business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might also help the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind that, for example, the chief executive of the funding agency could be summoned to appear before the Select Committee on Education. He is not quite doing justice to the panoply of powers that this House has, either through the Secretary of State or more directly, to give effect to accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. It is an important aspect of the work of the House of Commons that its Select Committees can, and do, look into Government activities; the Select Committee on Education is but one. However, the Secretary of State for Education would find himself in front of the Select Committee on an annual basis only, and would be cross-examined for just two and a half hours. That in itself is hardly an effective replacement for an LEA, which is accountable to a range of structures in its community. However, the Select Committee is valuable in its own way and I welcome most types of control exercised by the House.<br><br>
The Government expect the funding agency for schools to work. They have said that, next year, there will be 500 grant-maintained schools. I noticed that the Minister did not go further and say how many there would be by September, because that involves a financial element.<br><br>
If this part of the Bill works, and we preside over the demise of LEAs, a number of things will disappear. At present, a local democratic process of accountability involves the election of the LEA via county council elections. Local councillors will lose their right to represent their communities, especially in education matters.<br><br>
Another important feature that will disappear if LEAs go is the concept of the district advisory committees on education. That system was established in 1974 with local government reorganisation. Urban district councils disappeared and their education function was transferred to LEAs, the shire counties and metropolitan districts. They set up advisory committees: in my area, the Warrington district advisory committee for education was established. It involved the LEA and the local district council, as well as members of the education community and others. A number of representatives of business, industry and the churches sit on that committee. That system will disappear if the Bill is enacted. An annual report to Parliament, which Opposition Members propose, would go some way, albeit a small one, towards redressing that loss of democratic control.<br><br>
At our first sitting it was said that LEAs would disappear because of the proposed abolition of county councils. That argument is not good enough. It is to be hoped that when the county councils are abolished, they will be replaced by unitary authorities which will inherit the educational responsibility of providing sufficient places for education, in the likeness of the provisions of the Education Act 1944. Their role would be undermined by the introduction of the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
It is apposite to remind ourselves that the small measures of democratic accountability that we want built into the Bill will affect the majority of our children going through the education system. Education is probably the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
most important aspect of a person's life. I suspect that the provision of education between the ages of five and 16 is the most important aspect of the state's involvement in an individual's development. Children's futures are at stake, so the Bill should provide democratic accountability.<br><br>
If LEAs disappear, the Bill would have been the instrument of their demise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to leave that statement unchallenged. On what does the hon. Gentleman base his assertion that LEAs will disappear? I acknowledge that many people would not object to that, but nothing in the Bill supports that assertion: quite the contrary. The Bill enshrines an important and continuing role for LEAs. Any diminution of their role—not disappearance—will be contingent on the extent to which parents ballot for their schools to become grant-maintained. Will the hon. gentleman please stop using the term "disappearance" of LEAs? It is not in the Bill, and unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made three points. First, he is right to correct me; LEAs will not disappear entirely, but the majority of their functions will disappear if the percentage of grant-maintained schools reaches 75 per cent. the Statutory function of the LEA is to provide sufficient school places for children aged five to 16. In that fundamental role they are democratically accountable to electors every four years. They operate a series of committees and produce reports. That role will disappear, and I am glad that the Minister does not deny that.<br><br>
The Minister then said that that will only happen if it is the choice of parents. But that involves a one-off ballot of parents at a particular school at a given moment. That ballot does not take into account the interests of parents whose children may not yet be in the system, or may only be in primary school and about to move to secondary school. Those parents will have no choice about whether the school is grant-maintained or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we will return to the matter of annual reports.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not about to pursue the point about grant-maintained schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to question my hon. Friend on the Minister's statement. He said that the Bill will not result in the demise of LEAs. That is not true. The Bill states that once the 75 per cent. point has been reached, the LEAs will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said in the Select Committee on Education that he was happy for LEAs to go. He said that if they were to approach him he would consider taking away their whole function.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept your ruling, Sir John. You said that my hon. Friend's intervention was not relevant, so I shall try to deal with his point in a circumscribed way. I do not want to offend your authority.<br><br>
The Minister's third point was that many people would like LEAs to disappear. I am getting used to the Minister giving the Committee facts that are not backed up by statistics to prove his point. I would like shire counties to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
disappear, but I would like their education functions to find their way into the unitary system of local government which I support. There is a demand for local education provision. If the power to provide education could be devolved to local district level, I would welcome that. We are trying to build democratic structures into the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
As the democratic role of LEAs in the provision of sufficient places within their area disappears, the Bill should contain checks and balances to mitigate its worse effects. There would be a surge of relief, or at least reassurance, in the education community if the Minister were to concede the spirit of amendment No. 112: that the funding agency for schools should present a written, annual report to both Houses of Parliament. The Minister has nothing to fear from such a report or from parliamentary scrutiny of it. He will have everything to gain if the education community says, "Well, at least he is prepared to publish an annual report so that we can all see what the funding agency for schools is getting up to."<br><br>
As LEAs lose their responsibility for the provision of state education for those aged between five and 16, and local communities lose their ability to interrogate and make inquiries of their LEA, those communities will have to make representation to a national agency. Responsibility will be moved away from county hall in Chester to a national agency somewhere else in the country, perhaps to Darlington, to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, or to the constituency of the Minister of State. When access to those responsible is removed from a local community, it will be reassured by the publication of an annual report, which is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That will represent a modicum of democratic accountability but it will be a signal from the Minister that he is prepared to listen.<br><br>
We have heard much about parental choice in education. We were told that parents will be able to choose whether their child's school is grant-maintained, but once that decision has been taken by a group of parents by means of a one-off ballot they will almost sign away their right to further local accountability. Future parents will have no say in the matter except that they will elect school governors. Those parents will, therefore, need another means to discover what the funding agency for schools is up to. An annual report to Parliament would be a valuable step in the right direction and would not cause the Minister much aggravation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is nodding his head and I hope that when he replies to the debate he will concede that there should be an annual report to Parliament by the funding agency for schools.<br><br>
There is a further point. Taxpayers paying through the pay-as-you-earn system and, from 1 April 1993 paying the council tax—I have raised that matter with the Minister, who promised to write to me about it—have a right to be convinced that the provision of state education is being carried out properly, effectively and according to the wishes of the community. Taxpayers would be greatly reassured by the acceptance of the amendment.<br><br>
Rejection of amendment No. 112 would mean that the funding agency for schools would not need to publish an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
annual report and Parliament will be unable to scrutinise its activities. That would confirm again our worst fears that the Secretary of State for Education will, by means of the Bill, set himself up as an educational dictator, a concept that Rab Butler rejected when he formulated education legislation in the 1940s.<br><br>
It would be sensible to amend the Bill as we propose, it would not delay the Bill's progress or jeopardise other clauses. I hope for those reasons that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the Minister's earlier exchange with the hon. Member for Bath, he will either say that it is implicit in the Bill that there will be an annual report or, alternatively, he will tell us that the Government will provide for that to happen.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I shall set out some of the reasons why it is crucial that there is an annual report and the ways in which the funding agency may compile that report and conduct its own business. Once the 75 per cent. point has been reached—undoubtably it will happen in a few authorities—the funding agency and funding council will take over an important responsibility that the LEAs formally had. The LEAs operated in a public and local way in their own, specific area and had regularly elected councillors. Their debates in committee were subject to public gaze, with the reports to that committee and its minutes being openly available.<br><br>
In the context of the annual report of the funding agency, I wonder whether the funding agency itself will be holding its meetings in public, with its reports and the minutes of its meetings being fully available to the public. All those issues also apply to LEAs in carrying out their functions for the provision of school places.<br><br>
In clause 12, the funding agency and the council in Wales are given the possibility of having powers that the Secretaries of State for Education and for Wales have responsibilities for. Clause 12 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order provide for any of his functions under the provisions of this Act mentioned in subsection (2) below to be exercisable instead, either generally or in such circumstances as may be specified in the order, by a funding authority."</p></blockquote>
I shall not discuss the list of things that will be devolved to the funding agency and the funding council, functions for which the Secretaries of State for Education and for Wales would normally have been directly answerable in Parliament. When exercising the functions in clause 12, it is essential that the funding authorities are accountable throught the annual report, which can be debated in Parliament.<br><br>
When the funding agency takes on powers previously held by the LEAs—such as the provision of school places or those requirements laid out in clause 12(2)—we, as Members of Parliament, will be told by the Secretary of State that we must write directly to the chief executive or chairman of the board of the funding agency or the funding council to get our questions answered. It is therefore extremely important that we have the annual reports.<br><br>
There is then the question of the modus operandi of the funding agency and funding council in Wales and of the way in which the collection of information from schools for inclusion in the annual report is handled. Do the Government intend to issue guidelines about the collection of information under clause 5 and about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
type of information that the annual reports—which I think that the Government intend to adopt—should contain? Clearly, the financial information will be important. I hope that the annual reports of the funding agency and funding council in Wales will also include information about the quality of education provided in the sector for which those bodies are responsible. At a later stage, when the funding agency could take over the role of some LEAs in the provision of school places, it will have an important job to do examining the quality of education provision in that sector. That is much more likely to happen in the secondary than the primary sector and, as the Minister said earlier, it is a long-term prospect—if it ever happens.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will confirm that annual reports will be published, whether or not the amendment is accepted. I also hope that a little more flesh will be put on the description of the information that the Government consider should be provided, both as specified in clause 5 and in the annual reports from the funding agency for schools in England and the schools funding council in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accused the Minister of saying on Second Reading that the agency proposed in clause 1 would have a statutory, independent existence. I should have made it clear that he said that at our second sitting. I apologise to the Committee for that inaccuracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath was accurate in his prediction that I would argue that the amendments are otiose. I hope that my use of that word is correct and that the Committee's informal adviser on vocabulary and syntax, the hon. Member for Hemsworth, will agree that it is. Moreover, I am advised that the Oxford English Dictionary tells us that either version of the spelling of the word "Doomsday" is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the Minister's pronunciation is at fault. In English we say either—pronounced "eyether", not "eether". The latter is the American way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Occasionally, I display my Scottish origins, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is glad that I have not lapsed into pronouncing the word "tomato" as "tomayto".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While we are dealing with grammar, I am sure that all hon. Members checked their Fowler's for the proper usage of "less" and "fewer". My edition states that either—or "eether"—usage is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Member for Hemsworth and the Committee to know that the popular version of the White Paper was awarded with a crystal mark from the Plain English Campaign. The hon. Member for Hemsworth and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) are right. Any information provided by a Government or public body should be as simple, clear, concise and jargon-free as possible.<br><br>
Can I deal briskly with the points made during the debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall, but I wish to be brisk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister mean "can" or "may"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I forget.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
The amendment is unnecessary. We have a good friend and Bible, which the hon. Member for Bath mentioned—"Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments". Paragraphs 6.6.1, 8.1.1 and others refer explicity to the need for such bodies to produce comprehensive information through an annual report and financial reports.<br><br>
Clause 4, which we have debated and agreed, states that the Secretary of State may make grants to a funding authority,
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine."</p></blockquote>
I shall provide the next piece of the jigsaw: the HEFC and the FEFC must produce an annual report. A requirement in their management plans provides for that. The Secretary of State would require the funding agency to produce an annual report and financial reports through the powers under clause 4 and a management plan, as defined in the guide. The Secretary of State intends to follow the practice that he has established with other bodies when the FAS is set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the annual report be presented to both Houses of Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will. No—I must be accurate—it will be placed in the Library of both Houses. It will not be laid before both Houses. I believe that that important distinction is correct.<br><br>
Against that background—I do not want to rehearse this—we have the full powers available to the House through its Committees, the accountability of the Secretary of State, and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Opposition may be right—the Select Committee on Education may invite the chief executive of the funding agency to appear before it only once a year. However, it may wish to invite him more frequently. It is for the Select Committee to judge whether more frequent accountability is necessary or desirable. I do not share the pessimism of the Opposition about the extent of accountability. The House has many ways of bringing to account the Secretary of State, and chief executives of bodies such as the funding agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurances. He says that the terms and conditions to which clause 4 refers will include the need to make an annual report. Section 4 of the Education (Schools) Act 1992 contains a specific requirement that the chief inspector for England,
<br><blockquote><p>"shall make an annual report to the Secretary of State, who shall lay a copy of it before each House of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
What is the difference between Ofsted and the funding authorities? Why is it necessary to include a requirement in one measure, but not in another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ofsted is a separate department. It has a statutory existence that is distinct and independent from the Department for Education. The FAS will be more directly accountable to the Secretary of State through the mechanisms that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Enright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Parents need to understand the reports. The Bill should include a mechanism to provide information locally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must consider the extent to which it would be sensible for the information to be promulgated. There is a fine line to be drawn between sending the annual report to every parent and restricting it to the Library.</span></p>
