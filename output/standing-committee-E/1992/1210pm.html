	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch I was saying that clause 13 gives the Secretary of State an indpendent role in determining disputes. I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) how the Secretary of State, given his well-known prejudice and bias towards grant-maintained schools, could retain that independence in a dispute between a grant-maintained school which wanted to double its intake and a local authority that protested that that would damage education in one of its schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had time to ponder that question. Even for the present Secretary of State it must be difficult to be impartial. He is a man of great and wondrous ability, but even he may have problems in discharging that task in the quasi-judicial manner that is his statutory responsibility. We already know the difficulties that were caused by his off-the-cuff remarks in Kirklees. As the 	<i>Mirfield Reporter</i> reported, he implied that an application would be successful. That is difficult to reconcile with a commitment to examine all factors and matters in an even-handed way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem with clause 13. The Secretary of State makes the rules and appoints members of the funding agency. Clause 13 states that, in a dispute over functions between a democratically elected LEA and a funding agency appointed by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State will have the power to make the decision and resolve the dispute. That is neither fair nor just.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disputes over functions that will be referred to the Secretary of State involve difficult and contentious issues. For example, the Minister spoke earlier today about what constitutes a significant change of character. That is the type of dispute between the funding agency and an LEA which may be referred to the Secretary of State. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he had no doubts about the matter. He gave the Committee a guarantee that a proposal to introduce selection into a school's admission policy would amount to a significant change of character which would have to be referred to the Secretary of State. There was no qualification as to the subjects that would be part of such a selection process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That guarantee is interesting in the light of a letter from the Department for Education to Langley Park school for boys in Bromley. A civil servant called Mr. John Cairncross in the Department wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department takes the line that the introduction of any degree of selection in conventional academic subjects,
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
even if limited to a certain proportion of places at the school, amounts to a significant change of character and should be the subject of statutory proposals. On the other hand, we take the view that the introduction of a degree of selection on the basis of aesthetic subjects or sport need not be the subject of statutory proposals."</p></blockquote>
In many respects that differs from the Minister's observations this morning. It raises the question of whether the Minister's statement was incorrect. That would be unusual. It would be interesting to hear the Minister's definition of "conventional academic subjects" and to know what would come under the category of "aesthetic subjects" on the basis of which selection will be permitted. Those vital issues need to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill causes confusion. The Minister, in trying to be helpful, has confused hon. Members even more. The letter from Mr. Cairncross does not help to clarify the matter. Such disputes should not be resolved by the Secretary of State. We hope that the Minister will clarify what is meant by "selection" in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend. I shall refer to the provisions as they affect Wales. Clause 13 provides that any dispute will be determined by the Secretary of State. We assume that the Secretary of State for Wales will be the arbiter in any dispute between the schools funding council and the LEAs. The clause can be compared with a similar clause in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill which provides that any disputes between the National Rivers Authority and the Cardiff Bay development corporation will be settled by the Secretary of State. The principle is the same. The Cardiff Bay development corporation, like the funding council for Wales, is to be appointed by one and the same person—the Secretary of State for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales is elected—as it happens, he is elected by the good people of the Wirral, but that is not the point. The Secretary of State appoints people to various boards, many of whom are of the same political persuasion as him although not of same political persuasion as the majority of people in Wales. We have debated the nature of such appointments—	<i>Hansard</i> contains 42 columns of such debates. If a Conservative Secretary of State for Wales appoints members of the schools funding council, how can the system be just and fair? He is in favour of grant-maintained schools, so how can he deal with disputes? It will not be a semi or quasi-judicial decision; it will be totally and absolutely biased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the Secretary of State has far too many powers and it is about time that the House took powers away from him rather than give him more. That would also apply to a Labour Secretary of State. The Conservative party could argue that a Labour Secretary of State would be biased against grant-maintained schools. There should be an independent arbiter because a member of the schools funding council could not act impartially in any dispute with the LEA. It is bad law and I hope that the clause will not get past the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise with the Minister some of the points put to me by the Special Educational Consortium, which represents many organisations involved in special needs education. I shall enumerate some of them to give the Committee an idea of the spread of knowledge that is being pooled when studying the Bill and when checking issues that concern people involved with children who have special education needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
The umbrella organisation that co-ordinates the work is the Council for Disabled Children; underneath that, there is the National Association for Special Educational Needs, the Centre for the Studies on Integration in Education, the National Deaf Childrens Society, the National Childrens Bureau, the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Deaf Accord, the Spastics Society, Mencap, Barnados and the Independent Panel of Special Education Advisors—that is not all of the organisations, but it shows the spread of experience in the Special Educational Consortium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, the Spastics Society is concerned about potential disputes between the funding authority and an LEA, when they pursue their own powers and responsibilities in the provision of education. It feels that there is a strong possibility that many of the disputes could revolve around the respective responsibilities of the funding agency—or the council in Wales—and the LEAs about special educational needs provision. When the Secretary of State for Education or for Wales resolves such disputes using the power given to him in clause 13, it wants to be assured that all appropriate information will be available to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special educational needs world feels that anything that the Secretary of State does in resolving such a dispute should be based on circular 7/91. The circular elaborates on what the LEAs should provide in terms of a clear, coherent authority-wide policy. The Government, in the responsibility that they have placed on LEAs in that regard, take the matter very seriously. Stringent and wise provisions are made in circular 7/91 to guide LEAs attempting to provide for special educational needs in their
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are guidelines on what the policy should state and the arrangements for identifying children with special educational needs, including involvement by the LEA central staff, its schools, district health authorities, social services departments and voluntary agencies—an all-embracing role at the level outside the school. Within schools, there should be specific reference to the role of primary, secondary and special schools—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but this is a narrow clause relating to the resolution of disputes and the hon. Gentleman should relate his remarks more closely to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir John. I was hoping to show that people are anxious that the disputes that go to the Secretary of State will be about special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the bulk of the responsibilities for special educational needs will remain with LEAs, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will spell out why he believes that more disputes will arise in that context than in any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to do that. An earlier clause states that the integration of pupils with special educational needs into mainstream schools should be encouraged. We can expect that there will be a considerable number of pupils with special needs in grant-maintained schools. The funding agency will be responsible for ensuring that those grant-maintained schools have the appropriate resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is on the wrong track. Clause 13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any dispute as to whether any functions are exercisable by a funding authority or a local education authority shall be determined by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
At issue is not how the funding authority and the LEA exercise their functions but whether the function is correctly with one or the other. The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood the nature of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's helpful intervention. The earlier clause in essence lays a duty to pursue policies to encourage integration. The funding agency has a function through the pursuit of those policies to ensure that grant-maintained schools have the funding properly to carry out that work. I shall sit down and not pursue my argument if the Minister is saying that the funding agency does not have the responsibility for seeing that its grant-maintained schools provide properly for children with special educational needs. The Bill lays an obligation on all schools to integrate pupils with special educational needs and a function of the funding agency is to ensure that grant-maintained schools have the appropriate facilities to carry out that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not quite right. The responsibility of the funding agency for schools is to fund schools, based on a formula that will be determined by the Secretary of State. As I said, a document will be released shortly on the initial phase of consultation about what that formula should be. The resources of schools in the grant-maintained sector, including resources for special educational needs, will be covered by a common funding formula when that is the alternative to existing arrangements. It is not quite as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, will the Minister clarify a point? My feeling was that a funding agency was responsible for providing for mainstream and special eduation in a grant-maintained school, whether under a formula or not. Therefore, will the Minister tell me whose function it will be to ensure that children with special educational needs received the appropriate education in a grant-maintained school when, and if, the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now asking a different question. He wants to know who will ensure that children with special educational needs receive appropriate education. If such children are subject to a statement provided by the LEA, that statement will direct the child to the appropriate school. If the child does not have a statement but is identified as having a special educational need, the usual combination of factors—the overall provision of places, the admission arrangements for each school and the over-arching formula funding of the schools, either through the LEA or through the funding agency for schools—will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely as I thought. The Minister has said that that function will be carried out through such factors as the provision of places. We spent some time debating the funding authority's responsibility for the provision of places where it will have joint and parallel responsibility with the LEA between the 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. thresholds. After the 75 per cent. level, the funding authority will have total responsibility for the provision of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding authority will have a function in determining the appropriateness of provision of education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
in grant-maintained schools for pupils with special educational needs. Given the guidance in circular 7/91 to local authorities on the provision of special education for children who need it, and that our debate on a clause that deals with the resolution of disputes over functions has led to a dispute over whether the functions under discussion are appropriate to this debate, I should like to pursue the matter. Who does the Minister consider to have responsibility for the operation of circular 7/91? Does that circular apply to grant-maintained schools in the overall provision for children with special needs in any local authority area? If the funding agency, in parallel with the LEA, has responsibility for the provision of places between the 10 per cent. and 75 per cent. thresholds, children with special educational needs in grant-maintained schools must come within the functions of the funding agency. That funding agency must bear some responsibility for the provision of those places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Spastics Society and the Special Educational Consortium are justified in seeking clarification about the funding agency's function. The LEA's functions are reasonably clear. Circular 7/91 governs their operation. However, the Minister has confirmed that the funding agency's responsibility for the provision of places means that it has a function in the provision of special education in grant-maintained schools. There could be dispute between an LEA and a funding agency over that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a practical problem. Some schools with units for children who are emotionally and behaviourally difficult have had their applications for grant-maintained status approved. As a result, the grant-maintained sector makes specific provision for children with special need. There could be disputes between the two authorities about their special needs functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. The Bill also provides for special schools to be grant maintained. In such cases the funding agency function is clear and specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to concentrate on the provision of education for children with special needs in grant-maintained schools. The Bill sets out and emphasises the Government's commitment to integration. The funding agency must, therefore, make provision for special needs. There is potential for dispute between the funding agency and the LEA about the provision of places for children with special educational needs. Will the funding agency follow the guidelines in circular 7/91, which sets out the role of support services, the health service, social services, voluntary agencies, the whole gamut of schools and the co-ordination and monitoring of those organisations? Someone must monitor what happens in grant-maintained schools to children with special needs, who are not necessarily statemented. Under circular 7/91, a LEA could dispute the way in which the funding agency provided integrated education in grant-maintained schools. The anxieties of the Special Educational Consortium and the Spastics Society are valid. I hope that the Minister can reassure the Committee. However, the Opposition are not at all happy about the role of the Secretary of State in settling disputes between the funding agency and LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have argued consistently that the Bill is a recipe for chaos, which will arise out of the ill-defined roles of the funding agency for schools and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
LEAs. The Minister has tried to convince us that the authorities will co-exist. On 1 December, the Minister said in Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the parallel responsibilities operate in precisely this way: the funding agency for schools will have overall planning responsibilities for new schools, provision of places and closures in its sector, and the LEAs will have continuing responsibility in theirs".—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 December 1992; c. 393.]</p></blockquote>
That does not clarify the relationship between the LEA and the funding agency for schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like me, the hon. Gentleman remains confused. The Minister also said that he had given the Opposition the definitive answer to what had been "eating us up". A month ago, the Secretary of State talked about "parallel but not shared" responsibilities. That phrase contradicts the Minister's statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee that we have had two distinctly separate definitions: parallel but not shared and parallel and shared responsibility. I cannot easily imagine how the LEA and the funding agency for schools will co-exist in a particular area. The Minister's definition has only caused more confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 confirms that there will be confusion when the LEA and the funding agency for schools operate together. Out of that confusion may come disputes about the functions of the two authorities. Confusion has been made into statute and clause 13 has not helped us to find a way round it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and for Wallsend pointed out that when there is a dispute, the Secretary of State will arbitrate. I asked the Minister earlier to say whether the Secretary of State would be the final arbiter and he said that he would. However, the Bill does not say what constitutes a dispute under clause 7. If the Minister will tell us, it will help us to understand why clause 13 is so drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a conflict in the Secretary of State being the final arbiter. It is plain to everyone that the Secretary of State is a Conservative Member of Parliament. He may have to arbitrate in a dispute between a local Labour LEA and the funding agency for schools, which is appointed by the Secretary of State himself. He thus has a politically conflicting role, even though he may believe he will act objectively. My view is that it is hard for human beings to act objectively; they must declare their prejudices beforehand and leave others to judge the role that they have ascribed for themselves. The Secretary of State has declared his prejudice: he is in favour of grant-maintained schools and he will appoint members to the funding agency for schools; they are his place people. I am not convinced that in disputes between the funding agency and LEAs the Secretary of State will act impartially. Any fair-minded person will say that those disputes should be resolved openly and honestly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a way round the problem; my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend asked whether the clause as drafted was appropriate. The Minister must tell us now, or at his earliest convenience, whether he is prepared to publish guidelines or a framework within which the funding agency and the LEAs will co-exist. His statements so far have been confusing and contradictory and clarification is needed. I remind the Committee that the LEA is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
democratic, locally elected body and the funding agency is a centrally appointed quango. For those reasons alone, a framework is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Non-departmental public bodies—the Minister frowns. I do not know what he is reading. It is a thick tome and perhaps he will find the answer in there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. He has the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious because although the funding agency for schools will be an NDPB, and the rules of operation for such bodies are set down by Parliament and they carry out the functions ascribed by Government, this NDPB will carry out the functions ascribed to it by statute. There is a difference, which we may explore later. If the framework within which the two bodies would work was clearly defined, that could be one way to resolve the fact that disputes may not be sent to the Secretary of State immediately. It may be that one authority tries to carry out a function that it believes is the function ascribed to it by statute but the other objects, so there is an impasse that has to be resolved by the Secretary of State. That is not a very good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the Minister, being a reasonable man, will accept the suggestion that has been made. He recognises that there will be disputes between the funding agency for schools and LEAs—he may tell us what constitutes a dispute. Why does he not allow an education ombudsman to deal with such disputes? An ombudsman would be impartial and could be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It would alleviate the burden on the Secretary of State for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of natural justice, is not the best way to solve the problem to take the power away from the Secretary of State and give it to an education ombudsman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I hear the words chaos and confusion once more, I might become even more dotty than I am already.

I think that I have the answer. I had to wait a long time before I could follow the thread of the Opposition's arguments and solve their problem. I found the answer in this very helpful tome called "The Law of Education". Opposition Members will be delighted to hear that I have consulted their favourite statute, the good old 1944 Act. Clause 67 is entitled "Determination of disputes and questions". I might as well quote from that clause because we are in a leisurely mode—no one seems to be in much of a hurry for reasons I cannot understand. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Save as otherwise expressly provided by this Act, any dispute between a local education authority and the … governors of any school with respect to the exercise, of any power conferred or the performance of any duty imposed by or under this Act, may, notwithstanding any enactment rendering the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty contingent upon the opinion of the authority or of the … governors, be referred to the Minister"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any such dispute so referred shall be determined by him."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall finish making my point before I give way. We now find to our horror that the very provision to which Opposition Members have objected is embedded and enshrined in none other than their favourite
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
education statute, the 1944 Act. Since 1944, successive Secretaries of State have resolved disputes in a way that Opposition Members now find so objectionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most Opposition Members are fully aware of section 67 of the 1944 Act. The important distinction to make is that the disputes dealt with in section 67 of the 1944 Act are those between a democratically elected LEA and a group of governors who represent community interests—the parents, the local authority or the voluntary aided sector—whereas clause 13 refers to the disputes between an LEA and a body that has been nominated by the Secretary of State. That is the crucial difference. The Minister should understand that distinction. It is unhelpful of him to confuse matters by referring to section 67, which deals with a different aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not buy that. I do not accept that distinction. The hon. Gentleman's argument is ingenious, but it will not wash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, but the hon. Gentleman must let me develop my ideas. Clause 13 involves disputes
	<br><blockquote><p>"as to whether any functions are exercisable by a funding authority or a local education authority".</p></blockquote>
It is an important but narrow clause. In answer to the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall), I cannot offhand think of what those disputes might involve. I believe that the duality will operate satisfactorily. A combination of the provisions in the Bill and the new provisions to be added to the Bill will be more than adequate and will enable those functions to be exercised satisfactorily. If there should be a dispute of some kind, which I cannot foresee or imagine, the Secretary of State is the right person to resolve it, following the precedent of the 1944 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is straightforward. When there is a dispute between the LEA and the school governors, the 1944 Act states that the Secretary of State must claim to be impartial and independent. Yet he cannot claim to be impartial and independent because he appoints the FAS—a quango appointed by the Government. The FAS is directly accountable to the Secretary of State: it does not work to appeal to the 1944 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will give the FAS statutory duties, responsibilities and powers. The Secretary of State will make appointments to the FAS, which is right and proper. He will do that in his usual even-handed and impartial way. It will be in his interests to appoint such people who will discharge their responsibilities in a proper manner. I think that the Opposition's responses are somewhat excessive, given the nature of the subject. They are making very heavy weather of clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet heard whether the Opposition think that there could not possibly be any disputes. If that were so, there would be no need for the clause, which is essentially a saving clause. If it were not the Secretary of State, who else could it be? The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration could not have a role in that because his duties involve maladministration, not adjudication between different bodies to determine whose functions—if they are of a statutory nature—should be determined which way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised if the Opposition contested the clause because if the Bill emerged without it, it would be an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
assumption from the Opposition that there could be no dispute between the functions exercisable by the two bodies, and given the remarks of the Opposition that would be slightly odd. I concede happily to the Committee that in the unlikely event that such a dispute arose—in spite of all our efforts in the Bill to define and describe, in particular, the functions of the FAS—it is right to have a mechanism to resolve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given our view of the pernicious role of the funding agency and the Government's view of just how efficacious the funding agency is, I hope that the Minister will appreciate that we are bound to have a different view of the settlement of disputes over functions between the LEAs and the funding agency. In the settlement of such disputes, will the Minister rely on what the Bill says about their respective functions or on what other Acts say about, for example, the functions of LEAs or, in reference to grant-maintained schools, what the Education Reform Act 1988 says? Will the disputes be resolved specifically on the basis of statute or will the Secretary of State take into account other issues beyond statute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would necessarily be a combination of the two: the Secretary of State will have to be guided, as any Secretary of State would be, by statute, when relevant and appropriate; he may have to go beyond that and be guided by, for example, departmental circulars. Any Secretary of State would be subject to judicial review in the event that his actions were unreasonable or were subject to being contested. Whatever those involved in Government do, be they official, Ministers and so on, they are always conscious of that possibility. The mechanisms in our democracy ensure important safeguards against people in positions of responsibility exercising their duties in any unreasonable way. That is as it should be. Ministers' administrative role—sometimes called their quasi-judicial function—is rightly balanced by the role of the judiciary in the process.

All in all, clause 13 is a necessary provision. It is much more straightforward than Opposition Members have suggested. I can understand their synthetic rage at the Secretary of State's role, but on reflection they will agree that there is ample precedent for that responsibility residing with the Secretary of State. The absence of clause 13 from the Bill would look mighty odd, as it would imply either that there would be no disputes, or that there would be no way to resolve any disputes that arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I urge the Committee to agree to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his attempt to respond to the points that have been raised, but I cannot accept his description of our anxiety as synthetic rage. We have grave doubts about the ability of the Secretary of State to act in an impartial manner in a dispute over functions, given that he is so committed to the concept of the funding agency. Those doubts could be allayed only if the Secretary of State's actions could be restricted to reference to statute. That would allow arguments about the clarity of the law. The Government have made it clear that they do not consider the Bill to be a recipe for chaos and confusion. They claim that the Bill will be specific in the advice and guidance that it gives to the funding agency and LEAs as to the exercise of their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
The Minister is implying that he has some doubt about the Bill's clarity on this matter. Therefore, he wants the Secretary of State to have the responsibility for resolving any dispute over function that arises. Earlier, we debated at length whether the provision of integrated places for pupils with special needs was a function of the funding agency. I believe that it is such a function. Furthermore, the Minister said that one of the funding agency's functions was the provision of places. However, the local authority has a function in the provision of special needs education. That function is guided by circular 7/91.I tried to draw the Minister out about the function of the funding agency—whose counterpart in Wales is the funding council—and to ascertain whether it would be guided by circular 7/91. I also asked how it would be guided, if not by that circular. If there is a duality of function over special needs provision between the LEA and the funding agency, and if there is a further difference over statemented pupils—given that the local authority has a specific role in the statementing process—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of this by trying to find an example of how such a dispute might arise. If a dispute does arise, someone must adjudicate. Who should do so if not the Secretary of State? Whoever the hon. Gentleman suggests—whether it is the Lord Mayor of London—his decision will have to be final. However, a decision by the Secretary of State is subject to comment and debate by the House of Commons. In the case that the hon. Gentleman was describing, would he not welcome the fact that the House could hold the Secretary of State to account for a wrong decision? Ultimately, as my hon. Friend the Minister has said, the Secretary of State's decision is open to judicial review. Why does the hon. Gentleman not agree that that is a better way than any other that he could suggest? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will tell the Committee his preferred option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, as the Minister noted, the Secretary of State's decisions can be studied by a judicial review. We are grateful for that. There have not been many cases against the Government recently, but not so long ago they were taken to judicial review on several occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify the Minister's view of the functions of the funding agency in relation to special educational needs. The stated preference of the Government and the Secretary of State for the funding agency and the grant-maintained option for the delivery of education means that the resolution of disputes requires a completely separate body or individual, such as the educational ombudsman suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South. When we discuss clause 13 on Report, we may table an amendment to that effect now that we know the Government's thinking. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I hope that before we adjourn this evening the Minister will update the Committee about schools that have achieved grant-maintained status. We began our proceedings with the Minister's claim that two more schools had opted out, bringing the total number of such schools to 342. Since then, we have not had an update.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My name has become synonymous in the Committee with fairness

	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
and balance, so I wonder if my hon. Friend is aware of the ballot for grant-maintained status held on Tuesday by parents of Warberry Church of England primary school in Torquay? In that ballot, 86 per cent. of parents voted—399 of them against the proposal, and five in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is all very interesting, but I do not see its relevance to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson). I too am interested in the current total of grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is 356.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows that what was billed as an avalanche is really just a snowflake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 deals with disputes over functions between an LEA and the funding agency. I asked earlier about what is meant by the phrase "a significant change of character". The definition given by the Minister appears to conflict with that contained in a letter written by a senior civil servant in his Department. The matter needs to be clarified, because it is over such issues that disputes will arise. We need to be sure about what is meant by the phrase "a significant change of character".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that in a brief intervention. Soon, I shall issue a new circular, which will cover our latest advice and admissions policies. It will clarify such matters for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any admissions policy of selection on ability constitutes per se a significant change of character. However, if 10 per cent. of the intake of a school that wishes to specialise, especially in non-academic subjects, such as drama, music, or physical education, is selected on aptitude, that would not constitute a significant change of character. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman. I refer the hon. Gentleman to my coming circular, which will clarify matters beyond doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is useful, but it would have been helpful if the Committee had been told earlier about the circular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from the senior civil servant to which I referred, specifically mentions ability, not aptitude. To talk about ability and aptitude is an exercise in semantics. Selection is the main point. We are worried that the Bill provides for the sort of selection that will develop high quality education for a minority, not for all our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise my hon. Friend's point about semantics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate reveals that the contentious matters that we have discussed will cause dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to stress the difficulties of trying to resolve the matter when the Committee will be guillotined after such a short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must express our anxiety about the Minister's observation that the circular will make a distinction based on aptitude and ability, between conventional academic subjects and others. We shall oppose that. All subjects form part of a broad curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's claim that music is a non-academic subject worried me. The definition of music
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
in the national curriculum and the requirements of schools suggest that it is a very academic subject. That worsens the confusion about aptitude and ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It adds to the chaos and confusion of the Bill. The Minister's comments conflict with the idea of a national curriculum. There will be two categories of subjects: the conventional academic subjects and those for which selection on the basis of aptitude is acceptable. The Minister's intervention was important. When will the circular be published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will be sitting when it arrives. It will form part of a Christmas package with the documents on the common funding formula for schools, which will arrive soon—the time has not yet been decided. Those are significant documents.

We have had a valuable debate on clause 13. It allowed the Minister to reveal the Government's thinking on these important issues, limited though it may be, and I thank the Minister for his comments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to test the Government's thinking about the amount of information on shared responsibility for the provision of school places that must be made exchanged by the LEAs and the funding agency and made available to the Secretary of State. LEAs already have to supply a plethora of information—page upon page and column upon column—to the Secretary of State about proposed levels of expenditure, details of the numbers of pupils and teachers,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
the pupil-teacher ratio, the services that are provided and so on. The funding agency and the schools funding council for Wales will have to provide similar information about grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England, the task will be weightier because, with luck, the funding agency in Wales might be responsible for only three or four schools for a long time to come. The prospect of the number reaching double figures is not likely until the next century if, indeed, the experiment has not ended long before then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 lays a considerable responsibility on LEAs and the funding agency to collect information about the education systems for which both are responsible, to exchange that information and to send it to the Secretary of State. We must remember that the schools will have to collect information to send to the LEAs and the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, rafts, perhaps shiploads, of educational statistics lie in the vaults of the Department for Education. The funding agency and the council in Wales will also have to abide by the provisions of the parents charters and ensure that information is collected and made available to parents about the schools that their children can attend. LEAs already have considerable responsibilities in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would think about the issue of reasonable information in the context of what can happen if there are over-ambitious attempts to provide information. I refer to the recent fiasco—dare I say chaos and confusion—of the publication in England of the GCSE results. There are rumours in the wind that tomorrow the Welsh Office will publish similar figures for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope the wait will have been worthwhile and that accurate results are published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more information that is collected, the greater the danger that mistakes will be made and, of course, it costs a lot of money. The Government's figures state that £1.4 million was spent in collecting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is discussing how the information was gathered, not whether it was reasonably required in the first place. His amendment would apply equally to the requirement to supply information. Can he explain the effect of adding the word "reasonably"? On what criteria would it be based?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to do that. When the Government published the national GCSE results, they undertook a task that was beyond them. Those results could easily have been published by each LEA. It would not have cost as much, would have been more accurate and would have been a more reasonable approach to that task. By using the example of the national publication of results, I was pointing out the dangers if the Department for Education were to be too zealous in its demands on LEAs, the funding agency and the funding council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of the funding agency and the funding council for Wales contains the seeds of a considerable
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
bureaucracy. Admiral Collingwood, who was one of Nelson's contemporaries, used to plant acorns whenever he was home from sea because he realised that if the English navy were to be maintained at full strength a considerable stock of oaks would be needed. Although that has nothing to do with the request for information, it reminds us that from little acorns mighty oaks grow. From the little acorn of the funding agency in England and the even smaller acorn in Wales, there is the potential for a considerable bureaucracy to grow. One of the functions of that bureaucracy will be to collect information as required by clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That additional bureaucracy is bound to increase the cost of the education service. Two local organisations will be collecting information about the provision of education in their area. They will have a statutory duty to exchange that information for the proper provision of education. That work is currently carried out by the LEA. There is nothing to suggest that the Department of Education—or the Department of Education and Science as it used to be—has, or had, any criticism of the way in which LEAs collect information and pass it to the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By adding "reasonably" to the clause, the amendment would provide a modicum of guidance so that the funding agency and LEAs will know what is expected of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the Bill contained the requirement of reasonableness, the funding agency and the LEAs would have grounds to say to the Government enough is enough. Without that requirement, they could be at the Government's mercy and would have to provide whatever information the Government requested. The amendment would allow the funding agency or the LEA to tell the Government that their request was unreasonable. I rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause places a requirement on LEAs and the funding agency to make available to each other and to the Secretary of State information relating to their shared responsibility—or their parallel responsibility or even their shared responsibility with parallel duties—for the provision of sufficient school places. The amendment highlights the considerable time and resources that will have to be devoted to that exchange of information as a result of the bureaucratic duplication that the new administrative structure will create.

I shall not refer to chaos and confusion again because that point has been made and I would hate to see the Minister go totally mad. The point is well understood. As
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, LEAs are under an obligation to provide information and data to central Government, including returns on levels of expenditure, both proposed and committed, details for the pupil and teacher census and client information for a number of individual services. In addition, they have to provide an increasing amount of information to parents under the citizens charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend touched briefly on the recent fiasco over the examination results. He referred to the expenditure incurred for the collection of that data—the Government's figure is about—1.4 million. Even after spending all that money, it is not always possible to produce accurate, meaningful and useful information. I shall quote my professional journal, the "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society". That organisation is used to provide and interpret data and information. It refers to the collection of raw examination results published by the Department for Education. The journal states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The work of Aitken and Longford … and that of many others demonstrated that attempts to compare institutions on the basis of examination results should take account of the achievement levels with which those same students enter these institutions. The correlations between school input and output measures are relatively high (Aitken and Longford quote a value of 0.74)"—</p></blockquote>
That is a very high correlation coefficient—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and secondary schools differ markedly in their input distributions. Thus a failure to allow for input difference when comparing schools implies that the between-school variation, in no small measure, will reflect those differences."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, when studying examination results, the difference between schools reflects the input into those schools. There are difficulties when people try to provide meaningful information. The Royal Statistical Society implied that that data was not meaningful and its accuracy has already been challenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RSS challenges the usefulness of the information, which we must study carefully when we provide such information. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tables of 'raw' test and examination scores certainly carry information about intake achievements but very little about the average progress made by students within any one school. Furthermore, by the time that such information is available to parents and others, it refers to a cohort of students who, in the case of 16-year-old public examination results, generally entered their school five or six years earlier. Given that schools change over time, such historical information will be of limited use for the purpose of choice."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that data may look accurate, meaningful and interesting, but they may be totally useless for their intended purpose. The point that is being made by this learned society is that the collection of information is not an unsophisticated exercise: if the information is to be useful and meaningful, it is a sophisticated and complicated procedure, which is bound to be extremely expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government take the cheap option—which they did in this case—we shall expect inaccurate, meaningless and useless information. It may still be interesting because parents may think that it tells them something about their children's schools, but it can be misleading in the way in which it is interpreted and used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of a duplicate buraucracy in the form of an FAS will increase the cost of the education service, by requiring a second expensive data collection exercise to be undertaken. We have already seen a
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
complicated and expensive data collection exercise undertaken by the DFE at a cost of £1.4 million, which produced inaccurate, meaningless and useless data. If we are to make that data more useful and meaningful, the exercise will be far more expensive. I am worried that unless we include the amendment in the clause, LEAs may be faced with excessive and unreasonable costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bureaucratic procedure of having two authorities with parallel responsibilities causes difficulties. The cost must be cut to a reasonable level, or LEAs will spend all their money on the collection of information and very little on the education of pupils. The amendment would prevent unreasonable demands being placed on any part of the expanded bureaucracy proposed by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the amendment—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] The arguments in its support have been wholly without merit, and it will not take long to dispose of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am driven to speak because the word "reasonable" has its attractions at first glance. However, people who want to introduce a test of reasonableness into the Bill must have a clear idea of its effects. In this case, I am afraid that one can search the speeches of Opposition Members in vain for any guidance as to how such a test would operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a good example of a proposal that has no effect and no meaning. It has been debated at great length, but no further light has been shed on it. Will the hon. Member for Bridgend clarify the criteria that would determine an unreasonable requirement? What is the difference between reasonableness and unreasonableness? I listened to the hon. Gentleman carefully, and he seemed to say that unreasonableness would be defined by the authority that is required to supply the information. He did not say what the unreasonableness element might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened also to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), who quoted at length from learned journals. However, her concern was with the quality of the information that was being required, not with the reasonableness of the requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am not a lawyer, I understand that the use of the word "reasonable" is accepted as helping to define certain situations without requiring a specific list of what may be reasonable or unreasonable. It was claimed that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because in those circumstances the requirement has already been made. What would be in question is the reasonableness of the requirement in the first place, not the way in which that requirement is fulfilled by those required to fulfil it. Quite clearly, the hon.

That is irrelevant, and Opposition Members who want to import a test of reasonableness into the Bill must be prepared to spell out the criteria. They have not done so yet.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between a request for a reasonable distance and a reasonable requirement for information.

	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself caught between my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and the Opposition. During my hon. Friend's incisive questioning of the hon. Member for Bridgend—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend drove the hon. Member for Bridgend to admit something that I have not been able to get out of him. The hon. Gentleman said, when pressed, that guidelines were unnecessary. Yet guidelines have been close to the heart of the Opposition since our proceedings began. They have tabled amendments and made interventions to request guidelines. However, when the hon. Gentleman is pressed for guidelines, he is silent and uncharacterically shy. He said that we did not need guidelines to define unreasonableness. However, I forgive the hon. Member for Bridgend. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that I shall take refuge in an old friend, section 68 of the Education Act 1944. Clause 6(3) ties the funding agency for schools into that Section. It applies reasonableness automatically to the funding agency. Reasonableness has applied to LEAs since 1944 and will now apply to the funding agency. The Committee will understand my difficulty: while explaining to the Opposition that the amendment is unnecessary. I am at a loss to know what to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bow to my hon. Friend's superior knowledge and experience in legal interpretation. But insofar as the test of reasonableness has applied since 1944, I assume that we shall be reasonably able to apply it to the clause. My hon. Friend will concede—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, he better had. I am sure that my hon. Friend will concede that, contrary to the experience of our European partners, with which the hon. Members for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) and for Bridgend are familiar, the term "reasonable" is well tested in English law and perphaps even in Scots law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely seek to assist the Minister. Does not the definition in a famous law book refer to the man on the Clapham omnibus? Perhaps the Minister could phrase that in modern terms—the woman in a Bugatti on the M25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be either, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not wish me to include it in the Bill. I would not be too surprised when I consider some Opposition suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge made fair points, but they are not germane to the amendment. The amendment and the clause do not require a test for accuracy or validity, although that may be desirable. Reasonableness is different. A test for accuracy or validity would operate differently. Our debate develops the theme that we considered in clause 5. It is only right that, in their developing role and relationship, bodies such as LEAs and the new funding agency for schools should, when necessary and desirable for the discharge of their functions and responsibilities, be able to gather information that will help to provide a proper education service. That is the thrust of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that "reasonable" includes reasonable cost? Information provided at a reasonable cost must still be accurate and meaningful. The Minister may have misunderstood my point, which is that the provision of information, if it is done properly, can be very expensive and put an unnecessary burden on LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I shall do a quick interpretation of my clause, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with such information relating to the provision of relevant education in any area to which an order under section 7 of this Act applies as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady might concede that safeguards, such as "relevant" and
	<br><blockquote><p>"any area to which an order … applies",</p></blockquote>
for example, are built into the clause. The hon. Lady fears that LEAs and the funding agency for schools will run riot and spend oodles of money gathering information by the bucket load that will not be much good to anyone. That is unlikely and even if it were to take place, it would not be encouraged or permitted under the terms of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they should be encouraged to run riot when they are asked to provide information such as determining the differences between schools from examination results. That was an expensive exercise and it was not done properly. To do so properly would put an unreasonable cost on LEAs, the Department for Education or whoever carries out the exercise and we must safeguard against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to be drawn into a debate on the recent publication of information by my Department, its costs, accuracy and so on, but you would not encourage me to do so, Sir John. That may be for another day, although I warn Opposition Members that I feel very robust about the subject. We are discussing the ability to provide information relevant to the provision of education in a locality—the provision of school places and so on—not the dissemination of information that my Department recently did so magnificently, popularly and effectively. The distinction is thus clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition Members are satisfied about the "reasonable" provision. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere wish me to give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments about the 1944 Act and its long-standing test of reasonableness. I am persuaded that the amendment is tautologous. We may be able to discuss later the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge about the cost of providing effective information. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 8, line 17, after first 'education', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'or education for pupils with special educational needs'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is necessary; its omission from the Bill was probably a Government oversight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the Department for Education circular 7/91, "Local Management of Schools: Further Guidance", which issued guidance to local authorities on the framework within which they should provide for children with special educational needs under the local management of schools. The circular states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effective delivery of special education throughout an LEA depends upon a clear and coherent authority-wide policy. That policy must be made clear to the governing bodies and staff of schools and the other agencies with which the local education authorities are required to collaborate."</p></blockquote>
Some research carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation on integration in the school concludes that local authority strategies and support are critical to the facilitation of integrative practice. Recent Government-sponsored research supports that view. The ability of LEAs to construct clear and coherent policies based on accountability to parents and governors will be undermined by the introduction of the separate responsibilities of the funding agency and grant-maintained status for special schools. The provisions of the Bill mean that information and research on education for pupils with special educational needs will be extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While mainstream schools have the principal responsibility for pupils without statements who have special educational needs, the introduction of grant-maintained status and the funding agency will split the coherent monitoring of their needs in three ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five examples of independent review or research confirm that the principles of the Education Act 1981 have been undermined by the lack of government funding. They are: the third report from the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts on special educational needs and the implementation of the Education Act 1981, published in 1987; a document entitled, "The 1981 Education Act: Policy & Provision for Special Educational Needs Project (1986)"; "Local Management of Schools and Special Educational Needs (1990, 1991)"; and some work done by the University of London, Institute of Education in 1986. Bath university published a paper called "Additional Educational Needs and LMS: Methods & Money 1991–92". Finally, in 1991, the Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte paper "Costs of the National Curriculum in Primary Schools" considered the cost of providing for special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently some valuable work drawing out information and researching the problems of providing for special educational needs was commissioned jointly by the Spastics Society and the National Union of Teachers, which asked Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte to produce a report. That a report was published earlier this year and
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
was entitled "Within Reach: Access for Disabled Children to Mainstream Education". Much information was provided about special educational needs. Those needs will not be covered by the provisions of clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the need for research and information on special educational needs. However, I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman thinks that clause 14, which uses the phrase "as may be prescribed" to cover all possibilities, does not include special educational needs within the concepts of secondary and primary education. Whether special educational needs pupils are educated in mainstream secondary or primary schools, or whether they are educated in either primary or secondary special schools, there is no doubt that clause 14 covers the points made by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention demonstrates what is at stake. Does the clause cover special needs education implicitly, or does such education need to be referred to separately? It is referred to separately in both the Education Act 1981 and the Education Act 1944. Therefore, it would be useful to add the words "or special educational needs" to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte report identified the cost of pupils with physical and sensory disabilities in the areas of premises conversion and transitional staffing. It concluded that there was a need to determine, and publish, some assessment of what level of special need schools are meant to meet. It stated that there was a priority that LEAs carry out an access audit, with outline costings, to ensure at least that the costs of making education premises accessible to people with disabilities are known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report found that the cost of supporting children with physical disabilities or sensory impairment in mainstream schools need not be prohibitive. However, it also found that there is little reliable data for a comparison of costs between LEAs and therefore for an estimate of the cost nationally. That reveals a flaw in the existing legislation, and shows why it is so important that, instead of accepting that special needs education as implicit in the references to primary or secondary education, we should refer to it specifically in the Bill so that the duty is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of that original research, the Spastics Society and the National Union of Teachers intend to sponsor further research because they consider that much more needs to be done to gain a clear idea of the resources needed to implement policies of fuller integration of pupils with special needs in mainstream schools. It is essential that the duty to compile information and conduct research about the provision of education should include special educational needs provision. Other provisions in the Bill—for example, grant-maintained status, which removes an LEA's ability to target resources effectively and the 75 per cent. exit point—will remove an LEA's ability to monitor whether resources are being properly spent to fulfil special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's inspection arrangements are inadequate substitutes for the annual monitoring of LMS through the provision of unresearched information, which is specifically targeted to special educational needs. A crucial recommendation by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte in the report, "Within Reach: Access for Disabled Children to Mainstream Education" was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government encourage and support research into resolving the uncertainties and supplying the missing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
information … Without coherent data collection, and a standardised approach to quantifying existing per capita expenditure on pupils with different levels of special need in both special and mainstream schools, then the extent of existing progress towards the greater integration aim of the 1981 Act cannot be assessed, let alone the cost of progressing further."</p></blockquote>
It is entirely reasonable that we should add the amendment to the clause to ensure that special educational needs are clearly and properly catered for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have reached one of the areas in the Bill in which I have a particular interest given my involvement with pupils with special needs. For seven years, I worked in a multi-disciplinary assessment team: our remit was to try to keep pupils who were about to be thrown out of school and home in school and at home. We came in close contact with pupils with special educational needs. From that experience, I have a strong commitment to the Education Act 1981, which, for the first time, introduced a framework to deal with pupils with special educational needs. Another of its achievements—which I thought was a major step in educational legislation—was to abolish the categorisation of handicap and, instead, to define the individual special needs of each pupil and then to propose the way in which those special needs would be met. I am committed to the 1981 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 232 would place responsibility on LEAs to provide the Secretary of State for Education with information on special needs. The Government do not disapprove of what we intend to do, and the amendment is needed only because of an oversight in the drafting of the Bill. The Government have already conceded that there is a specific role for LEAs to deal with children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Education Act 1981 was passed in 1981, it was not brought into being until the regulations of 1983 were introduced. The delay for the implementation was, I suspect, to do with resources, which were probably not available in 1981. There has been good practice: the Act has proved to be good and has shown far-sightedness in education. On Second Reading, I said that I thought that it was perhaps the best educational legislation passed under the Conservative Government because it was based on the extremely good research done by the Warnock committee, which was commissioned in 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know the national picture of the provision in schools for pupils with special educational needs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend mentioned in his remarks on the amendment, several reports that have come to light show that there may be shortfalls within the provision for pupils with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that members of the Committee have read "Getting on with the Act"—the Audit Commission and Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools report, which provides an insight into the problems of pupils with special educational needs. A subsequent handbook was published. The policy and provision for special needs project issued another report. Those reports are two attempts to present a national picture. The Education Act 1981 was introduced without additional Government resources. LEAs used their money to implement the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there was little doubt that a lack of resources had severely hampered the successful implementation of the 1981 Act … A commitment of extra resources is needed if further progress is to be made."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
The Audit Commission and HMI report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a key problem facing LEAs was a) lack of incentives for LEAs to implement the 1981 Act … consideration should be given to introducing some incentives for LEAs to implement fully the 1981 Education Act."</p></blockquote>
Both reports stress the lack of resources for special educational needs. The amendment would make LEAs responsible for publishing information that the Secretary of State may require not only about primary and secondary education, but about special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) asked why such a provision was needed in the Bill. He said that primary and secondary education covered special needs. However, the provision should be overt, to emphasise responsibility for special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that nothing in the clause would prevent that information from being sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From memory, the Audit Commission and HMI report said that the problem was not simply one of resources. Problems were also caused when LEAs did not make special educational needs a priority, and by statementing. That was the main criticism of the current system. The report stated that much had been achieved but that matters could be improved if local LEAs made special needs a priority. That requires resources, and also the will to complete the statementing process and other matters that we believe to be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an useful intervention. "Getting on with the Act" mentions resources, and the important role of LEAs in providing for pupils with special educational needs. In LEAs where special needs have been made a priority, the 1981 Act has been implemented as well as possible. One of the barriers to integration is resources; another is information. The amendment states overtly that LEAs should collate information and present it to the Secretary of State. That will help to provide a national picture. I have worked with pupils who have special educational needs; with those who are in the 18 per cent. bracket and those who have statements. I have been involved in the statementing process and I appreciate the point that the hon. Member for Battersea made about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, a picture has emerged, which shows gaps in special educational needs provision. A conclusion of many reports is that access for pupils with physical disabilities to mainstream schools is one of the problems. It would be interesting to know from LEAs how they are adapting mainstream schools to allow such pupils access to school building. That is important if pupils with special needs are to be able to integrate into ordinary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is the provision of contact time, especially in primary schools, so that teachers can deal with pupils with special educational needs. One way to remove the barriers to integration in primary schools would be to give a teacher special responsibility for special needs pupils. That is a financed resource, which is not dealt with in the clause, but it would be interesting if LEAs were to publish information on the number of teachers who are designated to deal with special education needs children in primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff training to deal with special needs pupils is also a problem. If LEAs were required to publish information about such training it would give us a better picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area of interest is the provisions for girls with emotional problems and behavioural difficulties. What are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
LEAs doing to meet their needs? That information is relevant and would be covered by the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend referred previously to the provision of speech therapy. It used to be provided by the education service, but it is now provided by the health service. Is that need being met? A pupil in my constituency has a speech problem and is finding it difficult to manage at school, but he has not been given any speech therapy. If LEAs were required to publish information on speech therapy provision we would have a better picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend would be interested to have information on special needs support teaching in the Welsh language. How many such teachers are in post? It would be useful if we could glean that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised the problem because they have made a concession on one of our amendments. It would be useful if they accepted the amendment because it would promote the integration of special needs pupils into ordinary schools. Resources are one barrier to integration, and information is another. If we are to take the provision of special needs education seriously, research must be carried out in the state system. It is perhaps the right time to do that. If a funding agency is established in an area, there may be a division of responsibility. Grant-maintained schools may have units for emotionally or behaviourally disturbed pupils or for pupils with learning difficulties. We shall need to know how such provision is being developed in the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need to know from the LEAs what provision they have made for what is known as the Warnock 18 per cent., that is the 18 per cent. of pupils who have learning difficulties at some time during their school careers. Are their needs being properly met? That information would be required by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our biggest worries about local management of schools is that the funding formula devolving the budget to schools did not include the ring-fencing of money for special needs. Because of financial constraints, schools have used money that they should have spent on special needs to supplement the rest of the school budget. The requirement for LEAs to publish information would either allay my fears about that, or, if those fears are justified, would highlight the difficulty and enable special needs education in ordinary schools to be provided properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another barrier to integration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on one of my hobby horses: in one of the schools in my constituency, the figure is not 18 per cent. but 60 per cent.—a large number of pupils. Information needs to be assembled not only on special educational needs pupils, but on the other pupils—40 per cent. in the case that I mentioned—who are under-resourced in terms of their teacher-pupil ratios because the school provides—rightly—for children with special needs. The whole picture of the school must be presented, and care must be taken to separate out the special educational needs research. We want special educational needs pupils to be educated in the mainstream, but we must know the effects of such provision on the other pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. Warnock's figure of 18 per cent. was an attempt to give a guide to the extent of the problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, 60 per cent. of pupils in some ordinary
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
schools have a special educational need or a specific learning difficulty. In such schools, resources may be used more to deal with children who have special needs than with those who do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My belief is that resources in schools should be allocated to ensure that the needs of children with special educational needs—which are great—are met. They should gain the most from the education that they receive. The point made by the hon. Member for Battersea about examining the whole picture in a school is valid, as all Opposition Members will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the barriers to integration is the ratio between educational psychologists and pupils in an LEA. The statementing procedure can secure extra resources for the 18 per cent. of children with special educational needs for whom extra resources are not allocated at present. The trigger for that procedure is the role of the educational psychologist. Also taken into account are the school's efforts to meet the defined needs of a child, and parents' wishes as to how their children's needs should be fulfilled. There is also a medical report and, often, a social work report, but the key report is that of the educational psychologist. If there are not enough educational psychologists working with children with special needs, there will be a problem over integration. That will also mean that, for ordinary schools, the route to extra resources will be blocked. The provision of information would be valuable in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fear within the special educational needs community that the scale of the Bill—with its 255 clauses and its over-arching purpose of making state schools grant-maintained under the auspices of the funding agency—will mean that special needs will be marginalised. By accepting the amendment, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools can send a message to the special needs community to the effect that that marginalisation will not take place and that the needs of the child will be paramount, as specified in the Children Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons it is essential that the amendment is included in the Bill. I am sure that the Minister, who has been in reasonable form this afternoon, will concede the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require LEAs to provide information about special educational needs. The Audit Commission report, which was published earlier this year, highlighted the need for that information. It identified that LEAs often do not have a definition of special educational needs, which has led to difficulties between LEAs. From the table of results in the report, LEAs have different percentages of children who have been identified with special educational needs or statemented. In some LEAs it can be below 2 per cent. and in others it can be as high as 3 or 4 per cent. The Government should be concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South mentioned the problem of the way in which one identifies children with special educational needs who do not require a statement. Under the Warnock report and the Education Act 1981, the percentages were thought to be 2 per cent. of children requiring statements, and around 18 per cent. of children with special educational needs who did not need a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Battersea, I have schools in my constituency where 18 per cent. is inaccurate; in one school in particular, the non-statemented children with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
special educational needs amounts to more like 60 per cent. If we do not define precisely those children who fall into that category, it is difficult to allocate properly, the resources for them. It may be only a temporary requirement, which is another consideration that we need to identify, but it is still a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recently, LEA officers in Cambridgeshire always felt that the mythical 18 per cent. was a figure that they could cope with by distributing resources between schools. There was enough slack in the system to cope with those children without having to have a formal definition or identification. The children are generally coped with in the school environment by providing them with learning support assistant hours: an assistant helps the pupil with special educational needs on a one-to-one basis in the classroom and, thereby, assists the teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cambridgeshire, the LEA officers are finding that, because the percentage of children with statements is rapidly increasing, nothing, or very little, of the available resources is left for those children who have special educational needs, but who do not need statements. The effect is to put more pressure on the system: parents whose children have special educational needs are putting pressure on the LEAs to statement their children simply to ensure that they will qualify for the necessary resources that the children will need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is desperately important that the LEA has a good definition of the meaning of special educational needs, the level at which children need a statement and the level at which children are allocated resources, even though they may not need to be statemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but we are in danger of widening the debate to discuss special needs education and the resources allocated to it. I hope that the hon. Lady will relate her remarks more closely to the amendment. We shall have a fuller debate on special needs education later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Sir John, and I apologise for straying from the amendment. I was pointing out how important it is for LEAs to define what they mean by special educational needs. Without that definition, it will be difficult to supply the required information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs should specify the arrangements for identifying children with special educational needs, including the part to be played by LEA central staff, schools, district health authorities, social services departments and voluntary agencies, so that everyone is aware of their responsibilities. We also need to define the role of primary, secondary and special schools, so that they are aware of their responsibility for those children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the arrangements for providing education for children in hospital and at home and for placing and monitoring pupils in independent and non-maintained special schools. It would be a grave omission not to publish that information. We need to examine the arrangements for co-ordination—including the management and availability of sports services—and collaboration between neighbouring LEAs and district health authorities. Those arrangements will be important when the funding authority is working alongside the LEA. The information would benefit parents, many of whom are confused and ignorant of those arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
I know of a parent who has a child with special educational needs who was told that the child should be statemented. She was unaware of the procedures in the LEA to enable that child to be statemented. The informnation would benefit parents as well as the authorities providing school places in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some LEAs identify the resources available for the 18 per cent. of pupils with learning difficulties. In Cambridgeshire, resources were allocated between schools by using the number of free school meals in each school as a measure of the social deprivation and hence the level of special educational needs in that school. It was agreed by local education officers, teachers and parents that that was not a satisfactory measure of special educational needs, but it is difficult to come up with a good alternative. The difficulty lies in the lack of a definition of special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information on special educational needs is important to enable suitable places to be found for such pupils. We should define special educational needs and clarify the cases where pupils should be statemented. That is vital not only for the different agencies involved but for parents so that they know what provision should be made for their child. The amendment is reasonable. As the Minister is in a better mood than he was on Tuesday, I hope that he will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should, in fairness, remind the Committee and those who study the record of our proceedings closely, that the clause and the amendment deal with the provision of information about primary and secondary education. Special needs education is not separate from primary and secondary education. I emphasise that because Opposition Members may have given the impression that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am persuaded that it would be useful to include in the Bill the sort of reference to special needs education that the Opposition propose. I ask the Opposition to withdraw the amendment on my undertaking to present an amendment that would effect their proposal. I want to ensure that there is no confusion between special education as part of the overall system, and information about special educational needs, which formed the thrust of the amendment. I shall present an amendment in the spirit of the Opposition's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. He is right that we wish to include in the Bill a specific reference to education for children with special needs to ensure that they are properly catered for in a process of integration. I intended to intervene during the Minister's speech to give an example of the information that was lacking, and thereby preventing the implementation of a proper integration policy. I shall not do that. I record the thanks of the Opposition for the Minister's undertaking to present an amendment in the spirit of our proposal.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 8, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) in pursuance of proposals for the purpose published under section 	<i>(Proposals by governing bodies)</i> of this

	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
Act for two or more existing grant-maintained schools to be conducted by a single governing body.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take new clause 13—Proposals by governing bodies—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Regulations may make provision for two or more grant-maintained primary schools to be conducted as a group by a single governing body where the governing bodies of those schools have made joint proposals in a prescribed manner to the Secretary of State in accordance with this section.
	<ol>
	<li>any provision of this Part of this Act may apply, with or without modification, to—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>procedures prior to the making of such proposals, or</li>
	<li>such proposals, or</li>
	<li>the conduct of such schools, in such manner as the Secretary of State may determine.'.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 15(2)(c) provides for primary schools to operate as a group. A single governing body would conduct the group's affairs. The subsection refers to chapter IX, which provides other options for clustering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides many options for groupings or clusterings. For example, clause 105 provides for
	<br><blockquote><p>"two or more existing primary schools to acquire grant-maintained status and be conducted as a group by a single governing body."</p></blockquote>
That refers to primary schools that are initially LEA-maintained. I am not happy with that option. Before a school is allowed to have grant-maintained status, it should demonstrate its ability to stand on its own two feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other parts of the Bill there are various options for groupings or clusters. For example, under clause 114, a primary school eligible for grant-maintained status, or one that has already opted out, may become a member of an existing group. There is the possibility of two existing groups joining together and of a school leaving a group. All those options are, properly, subject to a range of caveats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
However, the option for two or more existing grant-maintained schools to join together to form a group is missing from the Bill. It is strange that under clauses 85 and 93 existing grant-maintained schools can propose changes in character, size or closure, but they cannot propose a new grouping or cluster. For LEA schools, that possibility exists. Section 9 of the Education (No. 2) Act 1986 enables LEAs to propose the grouping of two or more schools operating with a single governing body. That is likely to arise from proposals made by the schools themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clusters or groupings of that sort may be important, perhaps for the survival of one or more schools, especially in rural areas. The arguments about the importance of maintaining small schools in rural communities are well known to the Committee. If one or more of those schools is in difficulty, forming a cluster or group may help to save the school and thus a rural area's educational provision. That can be done in two ways—first by a voluntary move and secondly, by the more precise procedure of a group having a single governing body. That is possible for LEA schools and, in some circumstances, it has benefits for the survival of a school, especially in a rural area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that the option is not available to grant-maintained schools. Much as I dislike the concept, if there are to be grant-maintained schools, those in a rural area may need to take that option either to survive or to provide more efficient and effective education for the pupils in that area or geographical vicinity. It would therefore be sensible for the Bill to include such an option. That it does not may be merely an omission and the new clause and the amendment provide an opportunity to explore that issue with the Minister. He may argue that the wording of the new clause could be improved, but I hope that he will respond positively to my proposal.
