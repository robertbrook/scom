</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 244 is one of the important clauses that still needs clarification. The Government must say how it will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to allow local education authorities to supply specified goods and services to grant-maintained schools in their own or adjoining areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the clause allows local authorities extra freedom to provide these services, but in doing so would create significant anomalies. Worst of all, it could threaten some of the services which are so important to every school in an area, especially the local authority schools, whose services could be destroyed if local authorities do not have certain necessary freedoms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will use the debate on the first amendment to explain the way in which he thinks that the clause will work in practice. The Minister will have had many representations on the clause because it is causing so much concern among the people who are responsible for essential school services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow local authorities to provide services without needing an order from the Secretary of State. Various questions arise from the amendment, so I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to make an early speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need clarification of the Government's interpretation of trading at the margins. Over the past few months, there have been different interpretations: suggestions include a 10 per cent. limit and, in a letter to an outside organisation, it was suggested that the measure would apply only after 50 per cent. of schools in an area have become grant maintained. If so, there are still problems in the definition. Are we discussing half the schools in the area, or half the pupils in the area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
The clause gives the Minister a great deal of power to specify the goods and services that may be provided. What goods and services would the Secretary of State think appropriate? We need further information about the definition, "adjoining area". Why are Ministers being so specific about the trading that local authorities can do? It is surprising that Ministers should adopt such an approach. They are telling us that there should not be restrictions in the market and yet, at the same time, they are including in the Bill restrictions on local authorities' ability to enter such markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause limits the freedom of grant-maintained schools to buy services wherever they wish, which seems a strange measure from this particular Minister, who has been talking about the new-found freedom of schools that decide to change to grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister realises the genuine concern about the future of many important services. We have had representations about the clause from a range of interests, from those with experience of providing services to schools. Our amendments cover many services, including outdoor centres and school libraries. The Minister should recognise that these are not fringe interests; they are extremely important. In particular, the amendment dealing with school libraries, which I hope that we will discuss later, illustrates the damage that could be done if the clause is not amended. Any threat to the school library services will weaken the help, inspiration and back-up that those services often provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend is on the topic of school libraries, which I too hope we shall discuss more fully later, does she agree that the withdrawal of the school library service after two years will mean that grant-maintained schools—which Conservative Members are so keen to see flourish—will lack the service that has been provided for local education authority-maintained schools? That will restrict and hamper pupils in grant-maintained schools, because the private sector cannot hope to provide the same service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: grant-maintained schools may be denied access to a treasure house of resources which no school could hope to replicate. My hon. Friend's anxiety is well justified, but I am worried not only about the impact on the grant-maintained schools, which will not be allowed to buy into the services, but about the impact on the remaining local authority schools. If the school library service cannot serve a wide enough area, too few schools may buy its services for it to remain viable. The same is true of a whole range of services, and that is one reason why the clause is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) is right also to point out that the private sector could not step in and fill the gap. My own local authority of Kirklees has a school library service which has to be seen to be appreciated. As a resource for local teachers and schools it is second to none. The books, equipment and artefacts that it has built up over so many years could not be supplied by any other source. Schools could never have access to such teaching resources if they were not provided by a school library service with the backing of the local authority and the funds that local authorities have enjoyed in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My local authority in Durham last year loaned £2 million worth of stock to schools. Multiplying that figure by the total number of local authorities in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
country yields a huge sum. Where in the name of heaven would a private enterprise obtain sufficient investment capital to lend the stock to schools and thus make a profit? It is not a realistic proposition, and the Government must give way on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. His example of the lending of £2 million worth of stock proves the point conclusively. Moreover, we should recall what previous reports from Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools have said about the importance of school library services. The case is so obvious that I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee that the Government have had time to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem goes beyond the provision of direct services such as school libraries, important though they are. Other hon. Members may have received the same letter that I did from the British Medical Association expressing anxiety about the clause's impact on in-service teacher training, especially on training in matters such as child abuse and child protection. The BMA's members fear that such training could collapse altogether without the support and training provided by local authorities. Clearly, that would be to the detriment of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is fundamental to the future maintenance of the essential support services that local authorities have provided and built up. If the Government get the clause wrong, they will not simply damage local authorities—the Government do not worry about that—they will damage essential services on which schools rely, from day to day and from week to week. That will damage our education system and our children's welfare. I hope that the Minister will reassure the Committee that the Government have reconsidered the clause and that they will respond to the weight of representations that they have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister did not leap to his feet when my hon. Friend finished speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the time that has been allocated to discuss the clause. The debate is crucial. The Minister's response will determine the future shape of LEAs and the support that they provide to school pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will affect the access of all schools to LEA services. Many grant-maintained schools opted out in the expectation that they could continue to use LEA services. The clause will affect services to schools that have chosen to remain within LEA control. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury said, if the LEA's capacity is reduced, the quality and level of services will be adversely affected—especially the library service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cambridgeshire probably has more experience of local management of schools than any other LEA. The county began local financial management, and moved to LMS under the Education Reform Act 1988. Cambridgeshire has promoted maximum delegation of budgets for schools. It has divided LEA services into several units; for example, the Cambridgeshire curriculum agency, educational printing and publishing, the Cambridgeshire schools library service, educational personnel, education finance and so on. Schools with maximum delegation of their budgets buy back LEA services. The Cambridgeshire curriculum agency is 80 per cent. self-sufficient; the professional development centre is 100 per cent.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1350</span>
self-sufficient, as is educational printing and publishing. That system has been managed and developed successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional colleagues in Cambridgeshire would be disappointed if they were not allowed to continue with this enterprising system, which, I presume, the Government wish to promote. I believed that the Government hoped that LEAs would develop in the way that Cambridgeshire LEA has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty with the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970. When I read the reports and briefings I assumed that that Act was restrictive, in that it prevents local authorities from trading with non-public services. I was assured by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers), who has greater expertise in these matters, that it was intended to have a liberalising effect. The Audit Commission has interpreted it selectively, so it has become restrictive rather than liberalising. The two-year lifting of that restrictive effect will allow local authorities to continue trading, but after that time they will not be allowed to do so under the 1970 Act, except at the margins. It is difficult to know what "at the margins" means because it has been suggested that it could mean 20 per cent. on top of the LEA provision for its own schools. It has been interpreted in different ways in different areas. Opposition Members are afraid that it will lead to disruptive and complicated legislative procedures to interpret the Act and to clarify the meaning of "at the margins".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern that the clause has caused shows the difficulties of operating at the interface between a market economy and a public service. We have made it clear that we would prefer the education system to remain wholly in the public service sector. Government policy has produced fragmentation and has created difficulties in the interaction between LEAs and the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want to provide a high standard of service to support children's learning in all schools. If the clause is passed as drafted, there is a risk that we shall have the worst of both worlds. We shall lose efficient and effective local services, educational expertise and local knowledge, to the detriment of our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many services depend on a good relationship between client and provider. If the service is suddenly snapped off with no concern for the customer, there will be a lot of disgruntled parents and governors. The Government should bear that in mind, especially considering the time scale of these operations. We expect the two-year period to begin in 1994, so by 1996 we may be facing even more disgruntled parents and governors than now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is over-optimistic to believe that these services will reappear in the private sector and be reliable, available and affordable. In my county, a private agency turned up at one of the grant-maintained schools and offered personnel services. The agency was asked what it knew about terms and conditions of service for teachers and it said that it had never seen them—and could it please have a copy of them? That shows the level of service that private agencies can offer. Their approach is to learn as they go along. They cannot compete with the high level of competence and experience that has been built up by LEAs in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs are particularly good at helping schools to respond quickly to the many changes and untested ideas that the Government are trying to introduce to schools. Another proposal was announced yesterday—the changes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1351</span>
in the national curriculum for English. If schools are to implement changes quickly, they need a supportive local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cambridgeshire, St. Ivo school, which is in the Prime Minister's constituency of Huntingdon, recently suffered a devastating fire. It burnt down the science block and destroyed much of the work that the children had done for GCSE, including project work. The local authority came in quickly the next day and helped the school staff to rescue much of the children's work. It also gave advice on how to start temporary laboratories so that the children's education could continue with as little disruption as possible. That shows the real value of local education authorities. They could never be replaced by private agencies or insurance companies providing insurance cover. They provide the real help that schools need and they give it as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have struggled with the clause and the complexity of its implications. Because I have usually found the plain English version of the Bill much clearer than that with which we are struggling now, I consulted that. To my surprise the two-year limit on the relaxation of the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970 is not even mentioned in the plain English version. It is a cause for concern that governors of schools and parents may be unaware of the clause's implications because they have not seen them set out in the plain English version of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The moment that anyone mentions plain English, I am always tempted to leap to my feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where was the hon. Lady able to obtain the plain English version of the Bill? I was not even aware of its existence. If I had known that it existed, I should have had it in front of me for the past few months while we have been in Committee. Does she agree that if the plain English version contains no explanation of the two-year limit, that provides a further example of the need to clarify the way in which we write our legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury has just informed me that the plain English version of the Bill costs £150. That may be why it is not widely available. The copy that I have seen is a shortened version and it has missed a rather important aspect of the Bill. Parents may be unaware that the provisions of the clause are in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question was where the plain English version is obtainable, even if it costs £150.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 11 December 1992 shows that, contrary to other reports, schools in Cambridgeshire are buying local education authority services. That is despite the fact that Cambridgeshire probably has a higher than average percentage of schools that have become grant maintained. The article begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools in Cambridgeshire, the local education authority that has pioneered devolved budgets and a free market for services, have chosen to buy back almost everything the LEA offered during the first year of trading."</p></blockquote>
That is welcome news, and it shows the high level of support and confidence that schools in Cambridgeshire have in their local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to take into account that many existing grant-maintained schools took the decision to opt out before last July when the White Paper was published. The parents and governors of those schools did not know then that they were committed also to gradually opting out of access to local education authority services. If I were a parent or governor in one of those schools, I should certainly feel that circumstances had changed. As a parent or governor in any school, I might even speculate that the two-year limit could be a deterrent to supporting opting out in future. The Government should pay close attention to that if they really want to encourage schools to opt out of local education authority control. Schools are much less likely to opt out if they feel that the essential support of the local education authority of which they may wish to take advantage, will be removed from them in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that the power the Bill will give to the Secretary of State to override the restrictions of the goods and services legislation is welcome. However, there is no reason for that to be left to the Secretary of State's discretion and to be limited to a two-year period. Grant-maintained schools should have the right to an open market and to obtain services from their local education authority, or from whomever they choose in open competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the intention of the goods and services legislation is to protect the interests of local charge payers and the provision of local services. I cannot see any objection to Cambridgeshire offering a service to grant-maintained schools in its area. I do not know why it should be illegal for a local education authority to provide services to schools in its own area on a cost-recovery basis. The governors would be free to choose and to compare other services on the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that much more will be said about the matter this morning. I want to comment particularly on the schools library service, which is a good example of how the clause would operate in an extremely inappropriate way, were it to be implemented. I hope that the Minister will respond soon, so that we can gauge the reaction to the amendment, which I urge all hon. Membrs to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. PATRICK THOMPSON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause. Inevitably, there has been much misunderstanding and confusion—I was tempted to say chaos and confusion, but that has a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1353</span>
different pedigree for Opposition Members. Many important issues of principle underly the clause. I make no apology for believing that the fundamental role of local authorities is to enable services to be provided, rather than actually to provide them. We have seen the success of that approach with the contracting out of many services, such as many direct labour operations, street cleaning, refuse collection, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plainly, it would be wrong to limit the enabling role to such services. In my view, it is right that the professional services that local authorities provide should be subjected to competition. Too often those services—legal services, or whatever—can be costly to provide. There is a propensity in local government to expand services when the demand increases but, when the demand contracts, not to take many measures to reduce them. I base that on my long experience of local government. It is understandable. Generally speaking, managers of services do not wish their numbers to decline because their Brownie points are won by having larger empires to manage. Clearly, that culture needs to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to want many professional services to be contracted out—whether pay-roll, financial or other services. Indeed, many progressive and imaginative, as opposed to dinosaur, local authorities do just that. They recognise that the proper role of a local authority is to be an enabler. Many finance departments are carefully examining how they can reorganise to meet the new challenges ahead. Some are setting up business units; others, rightly and properly, are taking the more radical step and are setting up companies that are completely separate and at arms' length.

The issue is whether it is right to encourage or to prevent this process. To an extent, it is a chicken-and-egg problem. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), who rightly said that grant-maintained schools in Cambridge—as, indeed, in many areas—have chosen to buy back services from the local education authority. That is not surprising, given that the market has not been allowed to develop properly. In my view, the issue is simple. Clearly, Opposition Members do not wish it, but I certainly want those services to develop in the private sector, so it is important to allow the market to develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's argument is valuable. Does he agree that there is a propensity in certain quarters to underestimate entrepreneurial skills and the private sector's capacity to meet challenges—chiefly on the part of those who have a slavish, one-way devotion to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. On an even more positive note, many who work in local government—once they have managed to set themselves free and set up as separate companies—show all the entrepreneurial spirit that we wish to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I welcome you to your elevated role in the Chair, Mr. Thompson. Perhaps, as a special concession, we shall avoid jargon while you are in it and keep our language plain and simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a wealth of talent in local government and many people are champing at the bit to have the opportunity to set up their own operations and to sell services. They will make a great success of it.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1354</span>
The hon. Member for Cambridge said that it is right that grant-maintained schools should have an open market. I agree with that. The problem is with the point that I made before: unless that competitive, private market is allowed to develop, it will be a sham. Their only choice will be to buy the services from the local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I am absolutely appalled. Would he tell the Committee what will happen after two years if those entrepreneurs do not materialise and a service is not available from the private sector? Is he prepared to accept that, in such circumstances, children who attend grant-maintained schools might not get a library service, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not take such a pessimistic view. I am an optimist and I believe that if there is demand, it will, be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to gamble on his optimism? Is not it possible that a service might not emerge from the private sector? Would the hon. Gentleman then be prepared to let the pupils in grant-maintained schools go without such a service? Sometimes the market does not provide, and the hon. Gentleman must consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, of course I am not prepared to gamble. I would not want those services to be denied. What the hon. Gentleman says is typical of the negative approach to any progressive legislation. We hear the scare stories and are told about hypothetical situations because Opposition Members, whichever party they represent, are steeped in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not talking about preventing a private market developing because that will probably happen in any case. We are talking about giving the private market an opportunity to compete with the public sector. If the public sector is prevented from trading with the schools, they must rely on the private market. We are arguing that there should be free and fair competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point but it does not relate to what actually happens. I shall illustrate my argument: a few years ago, the Government rightly decided that many of the services provided by local authority manual staff—refuse collection, for instance—should be contracted out. Initially, there was massive hostility. There was not much of a private market and few contracts went to the private sector. Until a private sector emerges, the process is meaningless as there is no competition. What is worse, history shows that local authorities in such circumstances use every possible device to price the contracts artificially in order to win them. The desired competition is thereby forestalled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that we are intervening rather frequently and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He fails to understand that local authorities could still provide refuse services. Under this clause, local authorities could not provide the service after the two-year period has elapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady misunderstands the clause and the situation. Local authorities can still provide the services to their own schools. Opposition Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1355</span>
make great play of the idea that the grant-maintained school initiative is as dead as a dodo. If it is, there is no problem, because local authorities will continue to provide the services. The clause does not restrict local authorities' ability to trade at the margin. The clause liberalises it—if I dare use such a word in the company of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being reminded that there are no Liberals in this Room, but they seem to vote the same way on every issue. Be that as it may, this is an attempt to provide a small measure of liberalisation for a limited period of two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important issue is that of trading at the margin. It is not a weakness to say that that is not easy to define. The services being provided by the LEA need to be considered in detail and the auditors have an important role in that respect. What must be avoided are circumstances which the LEA would argue constituted trading at the margin while massively subsidising the services to prevent the emergence of the private sector. It is important to ensure that services be provided efficiently and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be dogmatic—	<i>[Laughter.]</i>Opposition Members may laugh. I am glad that they are enjoying the proceedings, but still I maintain that I do not wish to be dogmatic about defining "margin". Different circumstances will emerge in different LEA areas. Some areas will adopt an imaginative approach and set up private operations to compete properly. Others will be driven, quite properly, by the success of grant-maintained schools. Grant-maintained schools will demand their services and wish to buy them from different places. It is important to be clear about the price of the services. They should be provided in the most cost-effective way. If the LEA continues to provide services, we must ensure that there is no hidden subsidy solely to ensure the survival of a particular service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>I welcome you back, Mr. Martin.</p>
	<p>Grant-maintained schools will benefit from a thriving, open market. If LEAs provided services and the private market had still not developed, grant-maintained schools would be trapped into buying services from the LEA. But if the private market has developed and a company does not provide a good service, or tries to charge too much, grant-maintained schools will have the real alternative of using the market to buy services elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will exercise discretion when implementing the clause. The issue that it tackles is difficult to define. The Secretary of State's excellent record satisfies me that he will use the necessary discretion and sensitivity, which will ensure not only that grant-maintained schools can buy good services at a competitive rate, but that a thriving, private market will develop. That presents a welcome challenge to LEAs. Some will continue to provide good services, because many schools remain under their control. However, others will recognise the success of grant-maintained schools and acknowledge that the best way forward is to establish a freestanding operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the clause extends the options available to LEAs, albeit for a limited period, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume, Mr. Martin, that with your usual wisdom you will allow us to range around the clause. For example, although we shall discuss an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1356</span>
amendment that deals with the library service later, it is relevant to the clause. The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's discretion, but I believe that the Secretary of State should have that discretion. At all events, I hope that what I have to say will be in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probing time. We have not yet had a probe this morning, and I should like to put my proboscis into the clause. People outside the House are more worried about the two-year issue than about the overall provisions of the clause. I am slightly surprised that no amendment has been tabled to make the period five years or some other figure. Although the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) has tabled a later amendment that would remove the time limit altogether, it is interesting that extending the period is not under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dewsbury and for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) spoke about the denial of library services to schools. Will they condemn LEAs that already deny services to grant-maintained schools or schools applying for that status? [HON. MEMBERS: "Name them!"]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in Derbyshire, grant-maintained schools were denied the opportunity to buy services from the LEA? The result was that those schools had to go elsewhere. Private suppliers were set up in the area to ensure that the services were available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has responded, rightly to the request for an example. The Opposition should condemn that practice, which denies children the library service that they need. That need should be above party-political considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Bill would deny LEAs the ability to supply services to the grant-maintained sector? He seems a little confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not confused at all. I was giving a specific example of one side of the denial question. I shall move on to the question of whether schools will be denied by the Bill. It is crucial that grant-maintained schools and other schools continue to enjoy a good library service. The evidence so far is that grant-maintained schools spend more on books than was spent before. That is good news. There must be access to a library support service, but I see no reason why schools should not get that support from the private sector or through a contract with the local authority, not the LEA. That is not ruled out by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that library services regularly have direct local contact with schools and colleges, and it is interesting to note that colleges have not had a problem with such services since they began to move away from the local authortity sector. Moreover, colleges and the senior classes in schools can plug into the national schemes for finding and obtaining books. This is an important matter, but every GM school is aware of the need to have access to a library service. The demand will exist and the services will be provided, as the experience with the colleges has shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of in-service training. I cannot imagine that any school will not want to provide in-service training if it hopes to maintain its staff at a standard to achieve good results and attract pupils. Embryonic providers of in-service training are already appearing. I presume, however, that when the Minister and his Department see a need for in-service training and allocate additional resources through educational resource grants, those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1357</span>
resources will go to LEA schools and, through the funding authority, to GM schools also. There may therefore be an additional source of funding to come, and my hon. Friend the Minister may be able to confirm that. If a national need is perceived and national resources are allocated, they will be distributed fairly between the two sectors. Therefore, that worry may be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my probing a specific matter. I raised it on Second Reading and I hope that it is in order to raise it now. As I said, the point relates to the Secretary of State's discretion and concerns music. I do not mean the music taught in schools, in-service training of teachers of music or support from the local education authority for instruments, tuition or anything else, important as they are. My interest is in something that is on the margin of the debate—the provision by many, if not all, local education authorities of county orchestras, bands and choirs and the way in which they have established, supported, promoted and developed them. I have expresed the view previously that we must ensure that we do nothing to endanger them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has observed, as I do regularly, the school proms—which are the annual displays of the talents of county and borough musicians—will realise how music is a jewel in our educational crown. It is not a matter of provision for schools, which is why I said that it is on the margin, but of providing for children from one school to come together with children from other schools in the area to reach a level of excellence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the way in which enlightened education authorities create a service for pupils to enable them to develop their musical talent. It is truly a jewel in the crown. However, such services are already being destroyed by the pressures on overall budgets and the move to give schools as much of their budgets as possible. For example, South Glamorgan—which has an excellent record—is likely to withdraw its support for musical services to the tune of almost £500,000. Those services will be lost because the Bill will make matters worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is discussing something different—whether LEAs can afford to provide the service or whether they choose to make it one of their priorities. He rightly referred to enlightened authorities. I agree that some are enlightened, but not all provide that service, for a whole host of reasons. They may deem another area of education or another local provision to be more important. Many issues affect the provision of a good quality music service. The hon. Gentleman referred to one, but they include peripatetic music teachers and other matters that are not relevant to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to discussion of the clause, which deals with, among other matters, the way in which a county or a borough can make provision for an orchestra. It should not be prevented from doing so. As I understand it, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will include certain items in his recommended list of services for the two-year period. I want to ensure that he recommends to the LEAs that if orchestras are being provided now, they should expect and encourage them to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that we are talking about an authority-by-authority judgment, whether it is a question of marginal capacity or of discretion and extension. Therefore, there would be no question at this
	<span class='label label-info column'>1358</span>
stage, or subsequently, of the Secretary of State being able to issue a blanket reassurance or discretion, such as my hon. Friend suggests. I think that he will agree that that is best dealt with on an authority-by-authority basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine; it meets the position as it exists now. Areas will, I hope, choose to take up the example of others. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's reassurance that he views that as a possible way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that after the two-year period the grant-maintained school could not take the service provided by an LEA, even if it wished to do so. That is to ensure that obstacles are not put in the way of provision by private sector trusts of companies. I understand that argument for in-service training and other matters, but I am worried about what would happen if 50 per cent. of schools were in an LEA and 50 per cent. were grant maintained. We cannot have one LEA providing for half an orchestra and the other school trying to provide for the other half from a private company and being precluded from joining in with the LEA school. That is why the issue is right at the margin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will not answer the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to what I am saying before seeking answers. I envisage a problem with divided orchestras and divided orchestral provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may also confirm that under the clause provision may continue for a time, but only in the LEA area or its adjacent areas. I want clarification that that would not preclude a pupil in a borough school—who may come from outside the borough, or even from a couple of boroughs away—from benefiting from the service. That is a small technical problem. I hope that pupils will not be excluded from joining in such provision. That difficulty probably applies more to boroughs. It is easier to attend a school a couple of boroughs away; crossing a couple of counties to attend school is another matter altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many ways ahead. My hon. Friend has, through correspondence, kindly highlighted one or two of them, such as the trust in Kent that it already being set up to ensure such provision. If we are to take that route, I want us to whip along it because if the trust is not in place in good time before the provision of that service ends, there will be a risk, as some hon. Members have pointed out, of the service collapsing and thus of losing the jewel to which I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend will be aware that we do not have standard spending assessments for education for authorities in Wales, which means that considerable discretion is left to individual LEAs about the amount of revenue spent on education. Therefore, the Welsh authorities are in an advantageous position and can give the required support for music in schools in Wales, especially orchestras.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. He knows that, as Parliamentary Private Secretary in that Department, I cannot open my mouth on the subject of that Department. I am grateful to him for his clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave my right hon. Friend to dispute the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can find a solution because there is good will on the subject. Pilot projects are already being set up to show a way through. In the meantime, I hope that my hon. Friend and his colleagues from the Department will make it clear to LEAs and to local authorities that there is no reason why they cannot continue with their support through the grant-maintained system, even though they are not directly involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government expect that practice to continue in its excellent form. Before the Bill is passed, ways must be found to safeguard the future of our county and borough youth music—in orchestra, choir and band. In future years, when we enjoy the excellence of the schools proms, we shall know that that has been encouraged, continued and enhanced by this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proms were on that very week and I am happy to say that not only did the hon.

There was a good attendance. I hope that we shall all attend and that school proms go from strength to strength.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the Under-Secretary, knowing that the debate on such an important clause will end at 12.50 pm, to hide behind a series of speeches from his hon. Friends on the Back Benches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a new hon. Member, so he may not be aware that I decide who speaks in the Committee, not Ministers. They have nothing to do with my decisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly on the amendments. I have not had the opportunity to read the plain English version of the Bill, so the hon. Member for Dewsbury said she would tell me where to get it. Despite of the fact that it costs about £150, I am still interested and I want to know more about it. I see that the hon. Member for Dewsbury, who first mentioned the matter, is also leaving the Committee. The plot thickens. I hope that eventually I shall find out from where the plain English version comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not had the opportunity to study that version, I believe that I understand clause 244 well enough to comment briefly on the amendments. Basically, I support the clause, but I also support the request of my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) that our hon. Friend the Minister should treat the issue sensitively and be aware that there have been expressions of concern. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1360</span>
fair to tell the Committee that I have had more correspondence on clause 244 than on any other clause in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that, without the provisions of the clause, the ability of local education authorities to sell services to grant-maintained schools would cease immediately. I believe it is correct to say that the clause is a concession to local education authorities, in that it gives them a time period in which to go over the margin and sell services and goods to grant-maintained schools. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a debate in Committee between those, like me, who see the clause as a concession to local education authorities—although there may be debate on and interest in the details, which is why I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to treat the matter sensitively and to respond to the points raised on both sides of the Committee—and Opposition Members, who appear to regard almost everything in the Bill as a threat. I do not join those who see the clause as a threat; I join those who regard it as a concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the amendment tests or questions the two-year limit. The Government's intention is clear, and perhaps I may quote from the White Paper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be surprised to learn that I entirely agree with what he has just said? He said that the clause is a relaxation of the trading laws. I believe that he is correct, and that it is a two-year concession. In that sense, it is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman agree, however, that the concession is fairly meaningless because, after that two-year period, the provision reverts to the sole ability to operate at the margins, and if there is a growth in the number of grant-maintained schools in an area, the LEA would almost certainly then have to go beyond the definition of working at the margins? It would thus be unable to provide the service. Does not the hon. Gentleman believe, with me, that that is rigging the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me and with other Conservative Members that the clause is a relaxation or a concession. It is important to concentrate on that aspect and not to regard the clause as a threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is encapsulated in the quotation that I was about to make from the White Paper. The hon. Gentleman rightly wondered what will happen in succeeding years. Will things remain the same and, at the end of two years, will there be a serious problem—or will things change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government expects that increasingly the private sector will step in to provide such services. Some local authorities are moving to establsh trusts to undertake the organisation and delivery of services like individual music teaching. But the Government recognises that there are likely to be some transitional difficulties, particularly outside urban areas. The Government proposes that legislation shall allow the Secretary of State to designate LEA areas within which that or a neighbouring LEA will be permitted to provide services to GM schools, even where this means that the LEA employes additional staff or incurs additional expenditure which they would not otherwise have to do, for a period of two years only. The Secretary of State will withdraw such designation after due notice, as and when appropriate private sector suppliers of services emerge in the designated areas."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1361</span>
It is clear that hon. Members who support the clause consider that circumstances will evolve over the two-year period. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Bath made a fair point, and I am pleased that he considers this a relaxation or concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference in philosophy between Conservative and Opposition Members has affected the debate on this clause. Most Opposition Members never cease to exploit opportunities to defend bureaucracy and centralisation—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Whenever I raise that issue, there is uproar. As a former teacher, I know that striking a sensitive point provokes strong reactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the hon. Gentleman how he dares to speak about centralisation in that way. Is not the establishment of the funding agency and the funding council in Wales a serious centralisation of the process of funding local authorities? Will not those bodies be empowered to retain sums of money for special purpose grants and so forth? Will they not therefore have discretion to determine the nature of grant-maintained school spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had this debate before. We must not go out of order, but the hon.

It is clear that the education process in this Committee will only go one way. Conservative Members must continually try to explain how this Government have worked to bring about decentralisation by devolving powers to governors, head teachers and teachers in schools. That devolution of power is right, and the Bill furthers it. Opposition Members do not understand the Bill, which is why we are having so much difficulty with the clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never do that with you in the Chair, Mr. Martin, and I resent the suggestion that I might. My question to the hon. Gentleman is whether he thinks that the composition of a board of governors will affect their choice of services. For the first time, the Secretary of State will appoint the governors of voluntary schools, thus in effect cutting out the voluntary body, or at least removing the voluntary body's previously in-built majority. I hope that the Government will make some
	<span class='label label-info column'>1362</span>
proposals to deal with that problem, and that the hon. Gentleman will support me in asking the Government to back down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I attempted to respond to that question, Mr. Martin, I should risk departing from clause 244. However, I imagine that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will have heard it and that we may be able to return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the Opposition never miss an opportunity to defend centralisation and bureaucracy. The Bill's purpose is to improve quality, diversity and choice in education. I support the good work done in LEA schools and by many local authorities, but as a former teacher I do not believe that the primary purpose of an education Bill is to preserve any vested interest. I would never rise to my feet to defend the vested interests of the Department for Education—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>I am not referring to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I would never defend a vested interest against the interests of young people in schools. We are not concerned with people who earn their living in the Department, the local authority or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is genuine concern about the clause. There has been more correspondence about it than about any other. Norfolk county council supports the area limits proposed in the Bill, but it wants the Government to deal sensibly with various anxieties. Those concerns have been expressed by my hon. Friends, so I shall not repeat them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one way forward might be to accept the principle that LEAs should be able to provide services to grant-maintained schools—provided that they do so at full cost, with all of the hidden subsidies stripped away, and that they are able to enter on an equal footing the competitive market that the hon. Gentleman is so keen to see develop? That would conform to his party's philosophy and would provide some degree of protection in the areas about which he is especially concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates my next point. Although I do not accept his point, it leads me on to my final remark. The concerns expressed by the county of Norfolk are similar to those expressed nationwide, so it was not necessary for me to elaborate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was about to raise with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary links up with the hon. Gentleman's intervention. The Secretary of State and his colleagues have been quoted as saying that it will be possible for local authorities to set up free-standing agencies. My hon. Friend may be able to explain the Government's proposals. I support the clause; I regard it as a concession and relaxation. However, I agree with hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that the way forward must be spelt out. I hope that my hon. Friend will respond to all the points that hon. Members have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be met with such enthusiasm from the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before continuing the delicate probing of the Government's position that my hon. Friends have started, it would be appropriate to say that it borders on the curious, if not the disingenuous or hypocritical—although that is not a parliamentary term—for Opposition Members to talk about the rights of grant-maintained
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1363</span>
schools, as did the hon. Member for Cambridge, when in every other utterance they have said that grant-maintained schools and anybody who has anything to do with them are akin to the undead. It is curious that Opposition Members talk about the potential effect on LEA services of the expansion of grant-maintained schools when, for the past few weeks, they have been trying to persuade the country, the Committee and Parliament that grant-maintained schools have no future and so will not be a threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment appears to have been tabled on the premise that local authorities will be prepared—indeed, eager—to provide services for grant-maintained schools. Sadly, experience in too many local education authorities, irrespective of their being given the increased powers proposed in clause 244, suggests that it is precisely the opposite. Too often, despite the avowed intention and desire of many grant-maintained schools to have a different but nevertheless constructive relationship with their LEA, those LEAs have turned their backs on the schools. For example, that place well known for its educational probity, Birmingham, refuses to allow its swimming pools, libraries and other facilities to be used by grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a diversion from the real subject of the debate. The question is not whether certain local authorities might or might not want to provide services to grant-maintained schools, but whether, if they wish and are able to do so efficiently and competitively, they should be allowed to provide those services. That is what the hon. Gentleman should be discussing, not hypothetical cases or even real cases of local authorities behaving in a cavalier way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not hypothetical when the grant-maintained schools in Birmingham were denied services from the LEA. Some Opposition Members take a double-headed stance on the amendment and on the subject of grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why, if the services are so bad that they are to be done away with, are grant-maintained schools clamouring for them in Birmingham and have no better source to provide them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that they were clamouring for those services, but that they would have liked the opportunity to have them. That was denied them purely because of the ideological stance of the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an extension of powers to LEAs for a two-year period to provide services to grant-maintained schools that they could not provide before. It appears that those increased powers are limited to the designated areas of the LEA in question and the adjoining authority. Why? Baverstock school in Birmingham received unsolicited tenders for various services from a variety of LEAs—sadly, not in Birmingham. They were not all in the same LEA or adjacent to it. The Government should consider that in relation to subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary define trading at the margin and what impact will it have on the future ability of LEAs to provide services? I believe that it would be defined on a fixed-cost basis—if a service was in being, grant-maintained schools would still be able to take
	<span class='label label-info column'>1364</span>
advantage of those services, provided that it did not mean additional investment by the LEA to provide them. Will my hon. Friend please comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman help the Committee by defining additional investment? Does he exclude from that the employment of additional staff, whose salaries would be covered by the money for the provision of services? Many Opposition would be interested to hear him pursue that point with the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to hear my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tell us what he means by marginal cost. We shall hear that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point relates to the fact that the clause covers local education authorities and not local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend and other hon. Members on their splendid contributions. They have genuinely advanced the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will say something about the way in which grant-maintained schools are able to spend some of their increased funds on the provision of books and, therefore, libraries. Will he also take up the point that was made very well by my hon. Friends—about the fact that the schools will be able to use the local library, service? The local library service may develop as a result of the changes in the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will also emphasise—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Be brief, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to say that grant-maintained schools will be able to use their increased funds on books and libraries? We have been told categorically that the only reason grant-maintained schools will receive additional money is to provide for the increased responsibilities that they will be given by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr.
Martin—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was making an intervention before the point of order was raised, but was wide of the amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No. The hon. Gentleman has spent far too long on an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. In the educational world that would be regarded as a good example of continuous assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the difference between local education authorities, which are covered by the clause, and local authorities in general. Will the Under-Secretary tell us whether libraries will become the contentious matter that many hon. Members are seeking to highlight today? As I understand it, libraries are funded by leisure service committees of local authorities, not by local education authorities. Grant-maintained schools will thus still be able to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the same applies to outdoor resource centres, about which many of us have received letters.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1365</span>
Outdoor centres should not necessarily be provided by leisure service committees of local councils. They should be left open as integral parts and their services should be available to be bought by grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point was covered, en passant, by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson). He mentioned the circumstances under which the designation of an area would come to an end. He quoted the White Paper, paragraph 6.8 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will withdraw such designation after due notice, as and when appropriate sector suppliers of services emerge in the designated areas."</p></blockquote>
What does "due notice" mean in that context, and how will that affect the two-year period outlined in subsection (4)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, I strongly support the clause. One does not need to be a reader of "Reinventing Government" or to be in the Clinton camp, as it is popular to be among Labour party members, to recognise the difference between enabling local education authorities and authorities providing services come what may. One of the worries about a definition of "full-cost services" is that it is a moveable feast. Too often local education authorities would seek by hidden subsidy to undermine the legitimate efforts of the private sector to provide better services for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cite two examples. The first does not relate to education, but it is an example of local authorities' behaviour in such circumstances. Hackney—that well-managed borough and the epitome of non-corrupt local government—put its housing management out to tender, despite the fact that the estimate it received from Costain would have saved its community charge payers £750,000 a year over five years. It turned down Costain's bid because it had reservations about whether the firm, one of the country's prime building and civil engineering firms, had the financial resources to complete the contract. If that is not nonsense, I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's comments are very wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are very good, though.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All contributions are very good, but I have a duty to try to keep them within the framework of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on recent events in Conservative-controlled Brent? A private contractor who bid £1 million more than the local authority contractor was given the contract, but because a private contractor was involved the Secretary of State for the Environment could not intervene, whereas he can intervene in Hackney£</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention proves my point. The hon. Gentleman's comments have nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should very much like to answer the hon. Gentleman's question, but I shall now give my other example. I will not mention the name of the company, but a local council in the midlands has deliberately sought to use its statutory powers to undermine the ability of a private sector company to supply relief cover for schools, which is popular in schools in this particular LEA, and to prevent it from providing totally legitimate, good-quality
	<span class='label label-info column'>1366</span>
services at a good price to schools in its area. That could be a harbinger of the kind of behaviour in which many local authorities would indulge. It would go against the interests of pupils, parents and community charge payers if clause 244 were not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that his major fear is that local education authorities will continue to use hidden subsidies. Does he accept that, although many of us dislike compulsive competitive tendering, the Government's experience of it should make it possible to establish rules to ensure that there was no hidden subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The precise point that I have been making is that even within the existing, fairly rigid, rules on competitive tendering, local authorities can indulge in such shenanigans. Sadly, they are a harbinger of the kind of behaviour that would prevail if authorities were allowed to continue acting as the Opposition would like and if the clause were not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the clause. It will allow for the development of private sector services, possibly on a trust basis, offered by people who used to work for the LEA. It will allow a far higher standard of services for schools, which will be to the benefit of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to contribute to the debate, but its importance has encouraged me to do so—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us when the Under-Secretary will respond to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Opposition are anxious to hear the response of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, which will no doubt be up to its usual high standard and will hold hon. Members spellbound. The speeches of Conservative Members have been splendid. Mine will be short, unless I am interrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath has made many contributions to our debates. Today, he was right in one of them—probably for the first time. I hope that it will not be the last. He intervened in the characteristically trenchant speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North. I hope that we shall hear more from my hon. Friend today. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Bath for my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall willingly give way to the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright), for whom I have considerable affection. I shall refer later to his sedentary intervention about the quality of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misrepresents the hon. Member for Bath, who merely said that something very bad had been turned into something bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath is sufficiently intelligent and eloquent to speak for himself.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must defend myself against attacks from all directions. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was right to say that I agreed with the opening two paragraphs of the speech by the hon. Member for Norwich, North, when he said that the clause relaxes some of the provisions of the 1970 Act for a period of two years.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1367</span>
However, I then said that that relaxation was meaningless because it would not improve the quality of education in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to withdraw the complements that I paid the hon. Gentleman. He clearly has got nothing right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) made an interesting speech and many valid points. He referred to the greater freedom of grant-maintained schools. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North seemed surprised by that. My hon. Friends were right to remind him of LMS and GMS, which are important Conservative initiatives. They will improve the quality of state education, which the overwelming majority of the nation's children receives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the suggestion that we should try to assess correctly the true cost of a local government service. That is a pious hope, as will be appreciated by those who have been involved with local government, watched it evolve and witnessed the difficulties of assessing the true cost of services. How can we gauge the true cost of a local authority service? Creative accounting is not in it. The imagination that has been displayed by some local authorities in disguising and transferring costs from one head to another has to be seen to be believed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that this matter is a little outside the scope of clause 244, but for a long time many of us, including members of the Select Committee on Education, have been concerned about the transparency of education funding and the difficulty of identifying exactly how much local authorities are spending on education compared with Government forecastss. Does my hon. Friend agree that that needs to be probed further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important and salient point in his own inimitable way. He is quite right to draw attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout our discussions, hon. Members of all the Opposition parties have not disguised their opposition to grant-maintained schools—indeed, they have consistently attacked them—so concern for their welfare now is somewhat hollow. I find that very disconcerting.

I must draw attention to the attendance of Opposition Members. The clause is an important part of the Bill, but only four members of Her Majesty's official Opposition are in their places.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon.

Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. However, having only recently left local government, I feel it appropriate to make a brief speech. The speeches of my hon.

Before that, the speeches and interventions from Opposition Members had presented what I can only call the bleeding stump scenario.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a genuine point of order, again, Mr. Martin. You were kind enough to refer to me as an old and reasonably senior Member.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain a bleeding stump scenario to the Committee? It is where there is a pretence that, by accepting a clause such as this, it removes entirely the ability of a local education authority to trade in any form with a grant-maintained school. That is not the case because the clause does not remove the ability to trade at the margin. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to explain the margin more fully in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot envisage a position in which there is one, two or three grant-maintained schools—perhaps considerably more—in an area where the clause would affect the ability of the education authority to trade if it so wishes. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give us a clearer definition of the margin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My personal preference would be for a free market to develop. I would prefer education authorities to take the opportunity to set themselves up as providers, offering services to all comers, including grant-maintained schools and anyone else who considers that those services are right and proper for them. Only then will we ensure the provision of cost-effective and efficient services to the schools. Conservative Members want the issue pursued in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that education authorities would be far more likely to be invited to provide goods and services to grant-maintained schools if they were not so viciously opposing schools considering grant-maintained status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that point. The hon. Member for Cambridge said that the clasue would put off schools considering applying for grant-maintained status. Derbyshire local education authority could have traded in the margin, but refused to do so—but that has not put off schools in its area from seeking grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady's insistence that services should be provided by autonomous, competitive commercial organisations imply that those currently providing services and that do not have—and do not necessarily want to acquire—entrepreneurial skills should be disqualified? Is there no room in our society for people with great skills in all sorts of services but who do not want to develop entrepreneurial skills?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has scrambled the argument. I am a great believer in entrepreneurs. As I said, I should like organisations to be set up to provide those services. Local education authorities can sell services to grant-maintained schools in their areas, provided that they are trading at the margin of their capacity. The clause will not prevent that from continuing; it will extend the present opportunities. All the speeches of Opposition Members have missed that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Library services are important. Sadly, I know of a school library service that is almost non-existent. I hope that the service will be improved. Where schools have become grant-maintained and therefore have much greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>1370</span>
flexibility to use 100 per cent. of their budget as they choose in the interests of their pupils, their libraries have grown and improved. Such schools have been able substantially to improve the service offered to their pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made a heartfelt plea—if that is the right expression—for music services. I agree with him. I must refer to Derbyshire again, where the peripatetic music service was removed—an act which parents described as wanton vandalism. My hon. Friend the Member for Waveny (Mr. Porter) whispered to me at the beginning of the debate that the only county that he disliked hearing about more than Cambridgeshire was Derbyshire, so I shall not mention Derbyshire any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not give education authorities a blank cheque or carte blanche to continue to do what they want to do in the way that they want, regardless of the true requirements of the area. That would remove the opportunity for others to offer good services. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give me clear guidance on how the definition of trading at the margin will be interpreted in different areas. Will the Audit Commission have a role in the matter? LEAs in many, if not most, parts of the country will be able to continue to trade at the margin with grant-maintained schools for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate on an important clause. It has clearly illustrated what we already know—that Opposition Members are profoundly conservative. That has been shown time and again in our debates and it was reinforced this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall a document in the political arena some time ago called "Meet the Challenge, Make the Change". I was rather attracted by that phrase because political life and public service is about meeting challenges and making changes—but have we heard anything like that from Labour Members this morning? Absolutely not. Their attitude has been, "Avoid the Challenge, Make no Change".

As Opposition Members, and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North said, there have been more representations on this clause than on any other. Of course there have—the establishment vested interests view this area of provision as a challenge and they are afraid that they will not be able to meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary tell the Committee what representations on the clause have been received from the Headmasters Conference, representing the private sector and the grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the relevance of the hon. Gentleman's question. I cannot, off-hand, recall any representations from that quarter, but I may be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Under-Secretary that a letter from the Headmasters Conference to the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We hope that clause 244 can be suitably amended to allow LEAs to compete with private enterprise in providing services to the grant maintained and independent sectors."</p></blockquote>
Does the Under-Secretary accept that those are the views of the Headmasters Conference? Why is he not prepared to accept views from that representative body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike Labour Members, I do not jump to the instructions of any particular interest group. That may be the habit of Labour Members, but it is not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we have just witnessed a remarkable spectacle? The Headmasters Conference has given instructions to the Labour party, which is doing its bidding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have said before that hon. Members must keep to the amendment. I have tried to be helpful to the Committee on many occasions and the Committee must help and assist me by discussing the amendments before us</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issued and I have tried to answer some of the many questions asked by members of the Committee. Hon. Members touched upon the suggestion that it would, of course, be nice and cosy if we could allow the provision by LEAs to continue indefinitely, even outside their areas. I do not understand why it is presumed that LEAs have a monopoly of wisdom, efficiency and effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What deeply concerns me is that while there is banter about the rights and wrongs of local education authorities, if the clause is not amended many children in grant-maintained schools may be prevented from having the education that they deserve—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in LEA schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and children, in LEA schools. The Under-Secretary may huff and puff about the rights and wrongs of LEAs, but many children in grant-maintained schools will be deprived of services that are provided by the local education authority and cannot be provided by the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The private sector may well not be able to provide a library service, for example—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members may moan, but I am worried, as are my hon. Friends, about children being deprived of certain services. I ask the Under-Secretary to stop this fooling about and to take the matter seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his National Union of Teachers speech under the guise of an intervention. I do not blame him for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with the National Union of Teachers, which I am proud to represent. I am referring to the feeling of the School Library Association. That non-political group has the benefit of children in mind—which, it appears, the Minister does not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two or three important things wrong with what the hon. Gentleman said. First, he glibly ignored the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) told the Committee in no uncertain terms that a Labour-controlled local education authority is depriving grant-maintained school children of an important service. The hon. Gentleman suggests that, somehow, deprivation of grant-maintained school children will result from allowing grant-maintained schools to look to the market for provision of services—and, by implication, suggests that local education authorities have the education of those children at heart. That is simply and demonstrably not true, as my hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second mistake is the rather pathetic and unimaginative belief that no one other than the present providers could possibly make such provisions. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-East
	<span class='label label-info column'>1372</span>
made the point very well—the market is infinitely capable of making almost any provision known to man, given the right circumstances. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent grant-maintained schools from getting together in groups and consortiums, identifying their needs and encouraging the provision for those needs. It is typical of Opposition Members that they cannot, or will not, envisage that possibility. It is equally typical of my hon. Friends that we share the confidence that it will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is gleefully—I am looking for the right word because I do not want to be too rude—contemplating the demise of a service to children in grant-maintained schools. I accept that some local education authorities may have refused to provide services to grant-maintained schools. That is wrong and we do not defend their behaviour. But the Minister should look on the positive side and say that those local education authorities that do want to provide services should be allowed so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that the market will provide. Will it provide, for example, the service that Durham county council gives to its schools through its resource centre, which lends period costumes, works of art, historical artefacts, and so on? All those things have been acquired over many years and, if the Bill is enacted as drafted, grant-maintained schools will be deprived of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman again because he is making the speech that he should have made earlier, had he caught your eye, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I still hope to make that speech when we reach amendment No. 848, which Conservative Members have tried to prevent being discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the fact that the hon. Gentleman was absent for a significant part of the debate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Opposition Members may well have been absent because of some of the absolute crap that was being spoken by Conservative Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was not a point of order. I think that the hon. Gentleman should withdraw that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that word, but I think that the meaning will still be obvious in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What will be obvious in 	<i>Hansard</i>is that the hon. Gentleman has withdrawn his remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is reaching the stage where it is almost out of hand. I have no wish to do so but, if that continues I shall not hesitate to suspend the proceedings. That would be my last resort, but my patience has been sorely tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1373</span>
schools and about the ability of the market to meet their needs. Will he say why he feels that a constraint should be placed on the services that grant-maintained schools may buy? Why cannot such schools have access to a full market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because the market does not include publicly funded, non-profit-accountable bodies. That is the kernel of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, problem. If we permitted bodies that are not profit-accountable to continue to operate in the market place in perpetuity, as Opposition Members would like, opportunities for new providers to emerge and provide efficient, dynamic services to grant-maintained schools would be diminished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Does he mean that LEAs should not provide services and that the intention is to make it difficult, if not impossible, for them to do so? Does that mean that LEAs are to be enablers only, not providers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to make some progress, I shall try to help the Committee and explain what I mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that if clause 244 is not amended, in a few years time a local authority school with a 90 per cent. delegated budget will be able to choose between services provided by the local authority and those provided by and the private sector, whereas a grant-maintained school can look for such services only in the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the 1970 Act. The Audit Commission has noted that local authorities exist to provide basic services, but not to trade in the market place. Therefore, because we are liberating grant-maintained schools and allowing them, if they so choose, to move out of the LEA's orbit and into the market place, with all the freedoms and responsibilities that that implies, circumstances will change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that, if clause 244 is not amended, there will be a reduction in the choice available to grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there will be a huge enhancement in the choice available to such schools. As the alternative providers emerge in profusion—because we will not allow LEAs to swamp and monopolise the market with their unaccountable service provision—so provision to schools in general will increase. That is our judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he is telling grant-maintained schools, "You can choose, but only from this limited list"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because we have not yet reached the argument about marginal capacity. The Committee should understand that, in reality, we are not going to fall off a cliff edge. As more schools become grant-maintained, the Audit Commission, together with each authority's finance and other responsible officers, will have to examine the circumstances of each authority and determine the extent to which the trading by the LEA in educational service provision is within or beyond the margin of capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1374</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall just finish this point. I wish to make some progress, although Opposition Members are making it difficult for me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand that it is quite likely that, in most cases, the LEA will still have a role in such provision because it will continue to trade within its margin of capacity for some time. Only when that period of time is reached or exceeded will the concessions come into play. The authority will then be able to approach the Secretary of State and request another two years to effect the transition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's final comment was very important. I wan to raise two points. First can the hon. Gentleman confirm that in the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970 no statutory reference is made to the margin to which he is continually referring?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That margin was in fact, the creation of the Audit Commission and the Government's own legal advisers and it was hotly disputed by the local authorities associations. Secondly, would the hon. Gentleman clarify his point about a possible extension to the two-year period? That seems to be an interesting concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being slightly mischevious. The answer to his first question is that there is indeed no such reference in the 1970 Act. The answer to the second is that the provisions of the clause would allow the Secretary of State the discretion to give up to two years continuation of LEA trading in order to enable the transition to the new private sector provision. The purpose of the clause is concessionary; the Government think it is reasonable to give such provision, where appropriate, in the varying circumstances of the LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the specific points raised by my hon. Friends. My response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea about music provision is twofold. First, I see nothing that would prevent groups of grant-maintained schools getting together with LEAs to make co-operative provision of the sort my hon. Friend mentioned. Secondly—and it is an issue that he and I might examine in the future—section 145 of the Local Government Act 1972, "Provision of entertainments", states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local authority may do, or arrange for the doing of, or contribute towards the expenses of the doing of, anything … necessary … for the following purposes"—</p></blockquote>
one of which is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the maintenance of a band or orchestra".</p></blockquote>
That provision would possibly cover most of the points that my hon. Friend made. As I said, the area has not been examined in detail and we may want to do so later. There are several ways in which my hon. Friend's concerns could be met and I should like to examine them with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest was interesting. If a school uses the general public library service as its library service, it would not be covered by the provisions because the margin of capacity would relate to the general library staff. That would be containable. If the service were a specific one, it would come under the provisions I have mentioned. The combination of the ability of grant-maintained schools to make their own provision under their own budget flexibility with the possibility of grant-maintained schools coming together in co-operative measures or consortiums
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1375</span>
to seek the continuing provision of services, will be more than ample to allay the fears of those scaremongers who are going about saying that the provisions will mean the end of school library services as we have known them. That is not the case and, with some imagination, the matter will be dealt with satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Government's new clause 37 makes special provision for special educational needs? Would not he consider extending such qualifications to cover music and the library services, which also have a special position and which have the same problems as special education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a typical response from the hon. Gentleman. In addition to being a slave to special interest groups, he is attracted by the idea of unlimited special-case provision. Policy cannot be conducted in such a way. We made the concession in new clause 37, which I hope that the Committee will support, because the LEAs are responsible for the statementing process of children with special educational needs. We thought that provision for the supporting services related to that statementing process should be made and that they should be ring-fenced against the more general provisions. I do not believe that the same concession can be made for the other services. That distinction must be made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us understand the anxiety of civil servants—if education committees are abolished they, not Ministers, will be in the front line and will have to deal with complaints from local citizens.

Many Conservative Members are honest and frank in their desire to remove LEAs. Does my hon.
