	<time>Tuesday 17 November 1992</time>
	<p>[SIR JOHN HUNT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Education Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock, and with effect from Thursday 19th November at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
May I say, Sir John, on behalf of the Committee, what a pleasure it is to find you in the Chair and how much we look forward to your traditional firm but fair guidance in what will no doubt be the long passage of this bulky Bill? On the occasions when you cannot be with us, we look forward to serving under the chairmanship of Mr. Martin, whose fairness and firmness are almost the equal of yours, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be self-evident to the Committee that, given the length of the Bill and its detailed nature, we want to retain as much flexibility as possible on the sittings motion at this stage to assess, as progress is made, whether sittings should be held in the afternoon and, perhaps, even in the evenings. The sittings motion is framed in that spirit, in the hope that members of the Committee, under your guidance, Sir John, will want to make steady progress and to consider it in as much detail as the Committee believes is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, I can agree with what the Minister said—1 am not sure how often that will happen during our sittings—in welcoming you, Sir John, and Mr. Martin to the Chair of the Committee. The Minister described you, Sir John, as being firm but fair and Mr. Martin as being fair but firm. I am not sure of the difference between those two approaches: we look forward to trying to detect any difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there should be some flexibility about the Committee's sittings. In the present political climate, I can understand why a Minister believes that flexibility is needed—as Ministers never know which crisis will hit them next. There may be occasions when members of the Committee will feel that it is inappropriate to sit in the afternoon because there is an emergency debate or, who knows, a vote of confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the need for flexibility, I am anxious about some aspects of the sittings motion. I shall make only one or two brief comments on the subject because, as the Minister said, the Bill has much substance and we are keen to make progress and to discuss the detail. First, if the sittings on Tuesday and Thursday are inconvenient to the Secretary of State and that is the reason why he is not with us, we should be perfectly prepared to consider sitting on other days to facilitate his attendance. It would be proper for the Secretary of State to be a member of the Committee: indeed, it is insulting to the Committee and to the education world that he is not. It is surprising that the Secretary of State is not present because he claimed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
personally to have written the White Paper on which the Bill is based. He said that the Bill would set the education agenda for the next 20 years; on Second Reading, he said that this was the biggest-ever Education Bill. Unfortunately, he was equally quick to let it be known that he did not intend to serve on the Committee. Opposition Members do not understand why he cannot find time to be with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be aware, given her long experience in the House, that the Labour Administration of 1974–79 established the precedent that Secretaries of State did not automatically serve on Standing Committees. I remind the hon. Lady of two Standing Committees on which Labour Secretaries of State did not serve—those considering the Community Lands Bill of 1974–75, presented by Tony Crosland, and the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill of 1975–76. The hon. Lady is not being hypocritical—that is not a parliamentary word, so I shall not use it—but if she is not two-faced, she is certainly looking both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shows the debating tone that he would like our proceedings to have. I do not recall any other Secretary of State making such arrogant and boastful claims about his authorship of a Bill and then declining to see the Bill through all its stages. The Secretary of State has boasted so much about his role in writing the Bill and about its effect on the future of education that serving on the Committee is the least that he could do. If some sittings prove to be inconvenient, Opposition Members will be willing to show the flexibility of which the Minister spoke earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Secretary of State may consider the Bill so perfect that he can forget about it. I should be more convinced about that had his Department not been writing amendments after the Bill had been sent to the printers. That shows that the Bill was far from perfect then. The sad truth for the junior Minister may be that the Secretary of State knows that the Bill is a mess and will need a great deal of amendment and that he has left the job of picking up the pieces to the junior Minister who has the pleasure of being with us this morning and for a long time to come. Time and time again, it has been shown that the Secretary of State does not like to be put on the spot and questioned. That was evident in the debate on the Floor of the House, in which the Secretary of State was reluctant to give way. That resistance was clear to Opposition Members and, as a result of the Secretary of State's absence from the Committee, the Minister will have to answer many questions on his behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for my reservations about the sittings motion is that it is somewhat unusual to resort to afternoon sittings so early in the proceedings. I am sure that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) will jump up any minute now to tell me that it is not unprecedented. I do not claim that it is: very few matters in the House are without precedent. However, I am sure that even the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that it is highly unusual to move to afternoon sittings so early in the consideration of a major Bill. The last piece in the so-called jigsaw of education reform by the Government was not presented in the same way. Not only was there more time for consultation, but for a while the Committee sat in the morning only, to ensure that hon. Members had enough time to consider what amendments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
might be necessary. That leads me to the obvious conclusion that the Government are intent on railroading the Bill through the Committee and the House as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps our worst fears will not be realised; perhaps Ministers do not hope to clock up a certain number of hours before implementing a guillotine, regardless of outstanding issues. I fear that, in moving the sittings motion, the Minister signalled his intention of simply getting the Bill through as quickly as possible rather than exploring the issues as fully as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and final issue that I wish to raise about the sittings motion is the difficulties that have been caused by the time scale of the Bill's introduction. The White Paper was published at the end of July when Parliament was in recess and schools had started their summer holidays. The cut-off point for consultation was the end of September. That left little time for people to absorb the full impact of the proposals. The Bill was published on 29 October and Second Reading took place on 9 November. Today, 17 November, we are in Committee to begin detailed consideration of the Bill. If the Committee is to meet in the afternoons as well as in the mornings, we may have little time to consult people outside the House who wish to propose ideas for amendments. A great deal of anxiety has been expressed, both inside and outside the House, by those who believe that there has been insufficient time for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said that the time that we took to consider the Bill was part of the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shock, horror!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is shocked by that revelation, but it is in 	<i>Hansard.</i> When the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made those remarks, the Secretary of State nodded as if to agree with him. If the period of consultation is to stay open for the duration of our consideration of the Bill, that raises some interesting points, which should make us cautious about proceeding too quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If consultation continues, that raises problems about the status of the clauses. Are we going to rush to consider the early clauses that cover the funding authority—an arrangement that the Minister has not thought through? If we rush the Bill through without giving people outside the House a further opportunity to consider it, the clauses will be far from perfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the consultation process officially remains open, the Minister should confirm that so that interested groups know that they can make representations and that Minister will consider them. I do not say that Ministers will listen, because they rarely do that on education. Ministers have not accepted constructive criticisms of the Bill. They have not listened to the vast majority of people who are worried about education. They have not listened to parents, governors, teachers or to the professionals in the education world. They are becoming very isolated, and if we rush the Bill through, that isolation will create many problems in education for a long time to come. On that basis, I think that it would be most unwise of the Committee to meet in the afternoons as well as in the mornings, certainly until we have had proper time for further consultation on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the other Members who have already spoken in welcoming you, Sir John, to the chairmanship of the Committee and in welcoming Mr. Martin. As this is the first Committee on which I have served, I am sure that I shall learn a lot from your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) I am also concerned that the proposal to move immediately into afternoon sittings implies that the Government intend to rush through the Committee stage. It is in everybody's interests, including those of the Government, to take some time over the Committee stage and to ensure that there is a real opportunity for consultation and discussion. Perhaps we would have benefited if there had been more opportunity for detailed consultation and discussion before the Bill was first produced. Perhaps we would not have needed 17 major education reforms in 13 years if the Government had been prepared to think first and then legislate, rather than the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the Bill is significant and radical, destined to be as important as the Butler Act and supposedly setting standards that will go into the next century. Therefore, it is vital that we get the Bill right. There has been inadequate time for consultation. I said on Second Reading that the time for the publication of the White Paper was very short—probably one of the shortest-ever consultation periods for what is known to be the longest-ever Education Bill. The fact that it took place mostly during the summer holiday made it particularly difficult for organisations concerned with education to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary asked me how the response time could have been too short when the Government received nearly 1,000 responses. I have had an opportunity to talk to some of the people who made responses. Many of them said that they had responded because they had no other choice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that he will relate his remarks directly to the sittings motion. He is going a little wide in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your guidance, Sir John, but my point is that, because there was inadequate consultation before the preparation of the Bill, it is particularly important that we take our time in the Committee stage. That will ensure that the organisations that had inadequate opportunity to comment on the Bill will have adequate time to do so in Committee. Many of the organisations that did respond have made that point to me. Only today, the Association of County Councils said that it shared the concern about the short consultation time and thinks that, had there been more time, there would have been better-informed contributions to the policy-making process. We should take our time in Committee in order to allow those organisations the opportunity to make known their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It bothers me that we do not know who responded to the White Paper. In reply to a written question, the Under-Secretary said that he was not prepared to make available a list of them, but I hope that he will put one in the Library. The Library has confirmed that that is common practice among other Departments. The Department of the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Office, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Department of Health, the Department of Transport, the Department of Employment, the Home Office and the Welsh Office regularly put lists of respondents to consultation documents in the Library, but the Department for Education has not done this, nor did the former Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the point that we have reached in consultations, it is vital not to rush the Committee. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth reminded us on Second Reading that consultation continues during the Committee stage and that people and organisations need time to make proposals to us. Already, we have seen the problems that arise from lack of consultation. I hope that we shall not continue along that path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Under-Secretary say that the Government would be flexible. We have been told that amendments will come not only from Opposition parties and organisations but from the Government. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"I pledge that I will unhesitatingly move to tighten up the Bill".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 632.] Some Conservative Members said at the time that they hoped that the Government would think again. Given that the Government, Opposition parties and the various organisations that are genuinely concerned about education wish to comment on what the Government have described as a very important Bill, it is vital that we allow adequate time for consultation and do not at this juncture agree to sit in the afternoons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Sir John, from a Welsh point of view, to the Committee of a Bill that covers the Principality as well as England, although not, of course, Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) also made interesting comments about sittings. Given your long experience, Sir John, you will recall that over the years Governments have tended to use Standing Committees in different ways. Before the general election the Government decided to change the regulations governing local government finance and to introduce a council tax. I mention this because the Government decided that the Committee stage of the relevant Bill would last only three weeks and would meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays—which it did, and deep into the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last two years of government before the general election, the Government took it upon themselves to manipulate Standing Committees to ensure that proper scrutiny of Bills did not take place. I fear that the Government have not yet realised that times have changed. They have a heavily reduced majority and they cannot rely on a number of their own Members of Parliament, so they can no longer steamroller as they used to do; nor can they decide to do anything that they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many issues in the Bill require greater attention and consultation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury said. This is especially so from a Welsh viewpoint. I am pleased that the Minister of State, Welsh Office is present. I am sure that, as is usual, the Minister will give members of the Committee written information about the separate provisions for Wales and about the separate powers of the Secretary of State for Wales under the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons to doubt the need for the sittings motion proposed by the Government. First, in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Principality there is universal agreement among people in education—whether from local education authorities, teaching unions, or from academics who teach education in universities in Wales—that there has been inadequate consultation about a measure—especially the provisions on grant-maintained schools—that has extremely low support among people of Wales. Of just over 2,000 schools in the Principality, only three have decided to opt out, so there is no reason for separate legislation for Wales to introduce grant-maintained schools. The consultation exercise was wholly inadequate and the Bill is built on shifting sand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should consider local government reorganisation and how education is administered in Wales. It is highly unsatisfactory, to say the least, to discuss such a large Bill, many clauses of which apply to local education authorities in the Principality, when at the same time the Secretary of State for Wales promises the House of Commons and the people of Wales a White Paper, possibly within the next few days, on the new shape and structure of local education authorities in Wales. We understand that the Secretary of State for Wales intends to introduce a unitary system of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a vital matter. There is a strong case for proceeding with only morning sittings until we have had a chance to read the White Paper, and for us then to consider whether it would be appropriate to have afternoon sittings. The information that has been leaked about the White Paper leaves us in no doubt that there will be a fundamental change in the way in which education services are delivered in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths): the proposal is for about 25 to 30 new unitary authorities in the Principality, all of which will include local education authorities. Some of the provisions of the Bill that we shall discuss may be meaningless until we know the exact shape, structure, functions and nature of those new unitary authorities. It is premature for the Government to introduce these education measures before we know the likely shape of local government in Wales. That is not untypical of the Government because in the past few years they have thoroughly messed up the system of local government in Wales and in England. They have no time for local government and the way in which they are processing does not surprise me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will be badly affected by changes to the local government structure in Wales. I hope that the Minister of State will tell us—this morning if possible—whether the Government are to make an announcement in the next few days about the shape of local government in Wales and, if so, whether that impinges on our discussions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of the Bill that affects Wales is the setting up of several quangos in the Principality. Except for the six Tory Members of Parliament in Wales, we are all deeply opposed to the extension of that system of government. The consultation process has been too short and has not taken into account the objections to those quangos in Wales. In two weeks' time, the Public Accounts Committee will be looking carefully at the workings, or the shenanigans, of some quangos in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury are valid and I hope that the Government will reconsider the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by expressing my delight that I am under your firm and fair chairmanship, Sir John. I first met you more than 10 years ago on a parliamentary delegation to the Bahamas to celebrate 500 years of that country's Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Discussions about my past are not in order this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will be in order, Sir John—you were plain mister then—to congratulate you on your knighthood. Equally, I look forward to the chairmanship of my good friend Mr. Martin. Both will protect me from the ravages of the Minister, who can be very cruel when he wishes to be. We have sensitive ideas to propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried by the Minister's phrase, "steady progress". That sounds to me like a steamroller, going on determinedly, taking no notice of people's views. The proposal so early in our proceedings that sittings should be held in the afternoon does us a great disservice. In this Bill, the Secretary of State had the chance for real innovation. He could have come, like young Lochinvar, riding forth with a vision of the future, but his vision is these complicated clauses. He threw away an opportunity by destroying, or proposing to destroy, a most complex structure on which we need to be able to reflect at much greater length than will be allowed if, every Tuesday and Thursday, we are kept in the Committee Room—pleasant though it is—until the early hours of the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, the structure of voluntary-aided schools, a subject about which I know because, when I had a proper job, I taught in those schools for almost 20 years. Meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays will not allow us properly to consider voluntary-aided schools. We should consider their history: they were not founded on the wealth of the Dukes of Norfolk, for example. In the Catholic sector, they were founded on the pennies and ha'pennies of working Irish men and women. My great grandfather and great grandmother came over from Ireland and gave their pennies and ha'pennies from their wages as tramdriver and cleaning lady, as did my grandparents and parents. In the restricted time allowed, we must consider the sacrifices that were made by past generations to provide a tradition for those of us who followed. They made those sacrifices for a moral reason; they shaped their schools as voluntary aided and controlled to fit in with the local people. They were Catholics in an alien land but wished to be part of the local community. That is a difficult matter on which to reflect if we are to be moved along regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is most important. Those schools were essentially a real part of the community, but at the same time, for very poor people, the schools were at the vanguard of advances in education, helping to integrate the Irish Catholic population—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not in order. The hon. Gentleman does not return to order merely by occasionally mentioning the sittings motion. I hope that he will concentrate on the matter before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Sir John. I hope that I can give you the pleasure of discussing that issue later, but only if we are given sufficient time on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Tuesdays and Thursdays to reflect and to discuss. There are several matters which it cannot be sensible to discuss in this way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is anxious to have more time, why is he supporting his Front-Bench spokesmen, who want to stop us from meeting in the afternoon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Unlike the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland), I believe in meditation in general and in education. The time that we spend on the Bill must, in part, be devoted to meditation on it. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, listening to the Minister on a Tuesday or Thursday afternoon is not in any way conducive to such meditation. We must think seriously about the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we sensibly consider the morass into which our schools will fall if some opt out and some opt in? How are we to consider the ideas on which I want the Government to reflect if members of the Committee do not have enough time to do so? I want the Committee to consider the issue of diversity in unity. There was much talk on Second Reading about uniformity, when what was meant was unity. The glory of the British education system until fairly recently was that there was no system of British education—each and every school was proudly independent, and the controls to which they were subject were very delicate. We must consider that independence and think about how each clause affects it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must reflect on the issue of education versus instruction. Much of what I have heard about the national curriculum, testing and religious teaching—that is fairly and squarely central to our discussions—suggests that it is a matter of merely instructing, or rote learning: that children are being prepared for some television quiz show. That is all they will be prepared for if we take the path suggested by the Minister and push the clauses through. We would have no time to relax and to talk to each other in private to discuss our fears, desires, hopes and ideals, which are very important. The Minister's action precludes such discussions. It may also cause absenteeism from important debates in the Chamber on Thursday afternoons. When I became a Member of Parliament, I understood that the Chamber was crucial and central to everything that happened in the House. Yet the Minister proposes to take Committee members out of debates on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That would be a great sadness; we shall miss other political issues which are important to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools are not isolated entities, they are part of their communities. Part of our job is to consider how schools work within the communities in our constituencies and to maintain a dialogue with the teachers in those schools. As each clause of the Bill goes through, we should be able to discuss it and its effect with the teachers. We should be able to ask parents' groups what they think about the clauses and how much power they will have as a result. We should be able to discuss elections with teachers and parents' groups. Elections play a strange part in the Bill. I do not understand how people will be appointed to the new autonomous bodies that the Secretary of State will establish. Who will fulfil the functions that the Bill places on the funding council? We should consider that carefully. The Minister proposes to put an obstacle in the way of true reflective thought. He intends to push the Bill through, without consideration.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
The Bill lacks vision. If the Minister pushes it through quickly, it will still lack vision. We need the chance to put vision into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Bath, I am a novice to Standing Committee proceedings, but I am sure that you, Sir John, will guide me, in your firm but fair way, through an interesting experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition disagree with the motion because we acknowledge that a Bill that contains 255 clauses and 17 schedules deserves long scrutiny for many hours. During that time, we would welcome the opportunity of consulting the people who will be directly affected by the Bill. The Government seek to deny that consultation by rushing the Bill through Committee. That fits the Government's overall approach to this important Bill. The Government have learnt some political lessons during the past few weeks: it is best to get bad news for the country over with as quickly as possible. The Bill is bad news for the education service and for our school system. Therefore, the Government want to rush it through. That is why they have tabled the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth described the Bill as a Christmas cake. The Secretary of State called it a landmark Bill for the education world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is a landmark Bill, the Committee needs an opportunity to scrutinise it in detail and to discuss it with the outside world. The sittings motion denies that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth contrasting the Government's approach to the Bill, which, as the White Paper stated, will set out a framework for education in the 21st century, with that of Rab Butler when he introduced his landmark education legislation—the Education Act 1944. Rab Butler spent two years during the second world war consulting any organisation that was interested in education. He consulted parents, teachers, the churches and voluntary organisations so that he could introduce a measure that had broad support and was therefore built on firm foundations. He achieved consensus at a difficult time, when a national Government were in power. The measure could have divided the Government, but Butler consulted and, some time between the siege of Stalingrad and the surrender of Singapore, he managed to convince Prime Minister Winston Churchill that the new order that would be in place after the end of the second world war needed a comprehensive framework for education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a serious and fundamental point about the difference between the approach of the Government who introduced the Butler Act and that of the Government who have been in power for the past 13 years. This Government's approach to tackling education reform has been made even clearer in the past year. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is salutary to note that the Butler reform lasted for more than 40 years before it was attacked by this Tory Government? When they began the attack on the Butler Act, there was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
nothing like the amount of consultation that Butler had undertaken. As a result, the Government have had to introduce 16 Acts and now the Bill. Each has tried to amend earlier mistakes and each has caused even bigger difficulties, so that there are likely to be hundreds of Government amendments to this Bill. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be only sane and proper if our approach to sittings were a littler gentler?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. Clearly, the Government have not learnt from the 16 previous mistakes that they have made since 1979. They are now producing their 17th education mistake. As my hon. Friend said, a common thread runs through all 17 measures—the total failure to consult interested parties on the way in which education should be developed into the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his remarks more directly to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sittings motion will restrict the ability of Committee members to talk to interested parties worried about the Bill's provisions. Lessons can be learnt from the way in which Butler introduced his measure and I hope that the Government will acknowledge them. Butler introduced his White Paper while Parliament was sitting, not in the recess, as happened with the White Paper that preceded this Bill. There was a two-day debate in the House of Commons about Butler's White Paper, followed by a one-day debate in the House of Lords. Butler brought forward the Bill that became the 1944 Act in the light of the views and observations expressed in those debates. In contrast, this Bill was preceded by a White Paper published during the summer recess. There was no opportunity to debate that White Paper. The consultation period ended on 25 September, and many groups who are deeply worried about the Bill's implications have not been able to consult among themselves and discuss their response to the consultation document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the number of responses received in the consultation process for this Bill. Even the consultation process for the Education Reform Act 1988 resulted in more than 4,000 responses being made to the White Paper. That is a real contrast to the fewer than 1,000 responses that have been made to the proposals in the Bill. The reason for that is clear: people have not had the opportunity to respond. Even the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said on Second Reading that the Bill had been rushed and that there would need to be a period of consultation while it was going through its Committee proceedings. Yet, on the first day of our proceedings, the Bill has been timetabled in a way that would deny that consultation. We can understand why: the Government are concerned about what the interested bodies will say about the details of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not command the support of people who care about the education service. Many groups across the spectrum of education opinion are saying, "We have a Secretary of State who seems to have taken a Trappist vow; he will not speak to us or discuss the Bill."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secondary Heads Association, the National Union of Teachers and parent-teacher associations have all made strong representations about the failure of the Secretary of State to address their concerns about the Bill. The Secretary of State is not even going to serve on the Committee and has handed responsibility down to the Under-Secretary—an Under-Secretary whose one great

media opportunity in the year is during the dog days of the summer when he appears on television to discuss the GCSE exam results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going extremely wide of the sittings motion. Unless he concentrates his remarks more directly on it, I shall have to ask him to resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill changes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the absence of the Secretary of State poses a problem? The junior Minister—the No. 3 in the Department—is here. The incident in August, to which my hon. Friend referred, proved clearly that the junior Minister's remarks were superseded—indeed, attacked—by the Secretary of State. If the junior Minister must refer back to the Secretary of State for clearance about amendments that he may wish to accept and if we meet in the afternoon as well as in the morning, that will make things more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is illuminating to study what happened in the summer. Within a week of the Under-Secretary proclaiming the success of the GCSE exams, his superior, the Secretary of State, announced an investigation because he was concerned about the exams' standards. What mandate will the Under-Secretary have on Opposition amendments or responses to proposals from the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the incident to which he refers is not the only example of disagreement between the Secretary of State and the junior Minister? The Secretary of State refused to go to a public meeting on grant-maintained status, saying that it was wrong to politicise the debate. Within seven days, we had notification that the junior Minister was attending such a public meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. These matters may be raised in other debates, at other times, but they should not be raised on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our worry about the sittings motion concerns the status and standing of the Under-Secretary. The Under-Secretary's observation in the summer were effectively countermanded within seven days by his political superior, the Secretary of State. Given the compacted sittings motion, similar difficulties might arise. The Government intend to table many amendments; what status will they have? If the Opposition can get amendments accepted, what will be the Under-Secretary's response—will he speak on behalf of the Government or will he be countermanded, again, by the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill reaches the statute book, it will fundamentally change the structure of education in England and Wales. We are concerned that the local government world is changing quickly—my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) mentioned the position in Wales. In such circumstances, haste will not assist the House to produce an Act that will set the framework of education for England and Wales into the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will change fundamentally the nature of local education authorities and, in some areas, may mean that education authorities as we know them will no longer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
exist. I argue strongly that legislation that will affect so fundamentally the whole basis of local democracy should not be rushed through in this way. We should take our time and consult interested parties to ensure that when the Bill reaches the statute book it will, like the Butler Act, stand the test of time. These legislative proposals are based not on consensus and achieving a partnership but on haste, confrontation and competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion reflects all that has been wrong with the Bill to date. It was conceived within five weeks of the Secretary of State taking office in May. In that short time, he decided that a White Paper was needed; within three months it had been drawn up. During that time there was no consultation whatever with any interested party—or at least not with anyone whom the Secretary of State will admit to consulting. It was published, and over the summer little opportunity for consultation was allowed. That is not the way to proceed. The Government should learn from the success of the Butler Act by taking time, and taking people with them: that way they can lay the foundation and framework of an education service that will meet the country's needs. The haste now being shown in the sittings motion points to a Government who are scared of debate and will not argue the issues, and who seek instead to rush the proposals through. That cannot be in the interests of the country or our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A valuable point that has been made is that the Committee has many new Members of Parliament and that it takes us some time to become accustomed to new procedures and to read the enormous amount of paperwork involved. I staggered home last night with several documents and staggered back with them this morning having fallen asleep reading some of them. We need sufficient time between sittings to get to grips with the detail in a proper and thorough manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restricted time for consultation during the summer in my constituency meant that many people tried to write responses without adequate time to consult colleagues. This meant often that LEAs, teachers and parent groups wrote papers and letters in isolation, without adequate discussion. It is most important that issues as fundamental as those in the Bill are discussed only after people have had series of meeting, have reflected, talked, and met again to consult and reflect yet again. This is a vital part of the process not only of consultation but of change. Changes in attitude will be necessary if some of the Bill's proposals come about, so as to avoid the widespread disruption that I fear.

The example that I can give is of the consultation that I became involved in after I was fortunate enough to come first in the ballot for Members' motions at the end of July. The subject of my motion was special educational needs, and involved a great deal of work. I spent much time talking to parents and teachers and to pupils with special educational needs. One of my staff also spent much time collecting information, visiting schools and reading letters from parents and teachers. An important task was talking to learning support assistants in schools who play a most important part in the care of pupils with special educational needs. It was also important to talk to local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
education authority officials, who have considerable experience in dealing with all aspects of special educational needs. I spent many hours talking to constituents and many more at Westminster talking to people who were anxious to give me advice on this extremely important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion will preclude much of the consultation in which I should like to participate. Sitting on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons would restrict my movements in the constituency on Thursday evenings and on Fridays and would shorten time for consultation during the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill sets out fundamental changes in education—perhaps the most fundamental ever. The Minister would do well to reflect upon the Act that introduced the poll tax and the disaster that ensued because there had been inadequate consultation on its provisions. He might also reflect upon the fact that it could have brought down the Government: it certainly contributed to the downfall of a Prime Minister. If he does not wish the same fate to befall him, perhaps he will consider consulting more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most important that the Secretary of State listens to other people's views. Like other Opposition Members I am disappointed that the Secretary of State is not present to listen to, and to benefit from, hearing about consultations between hon. Members and their constituents. If he were, he would learn a great deal about our system of state education and would benefit from the experience of others. It is disappointing that he has absented himself completely from our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the sittings motion will be rejected because it is most important for the future education of our children that everyone has adequate time to consult—time that the sittings motion will not allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I thought that the Government had at long last learnt from their mistakes. It is generally agreed that the Bill's proposals and the White Paper that preceded them were conceived in haste. When the Government announced that Second Reading would take place over two days, I thought that they had acknowledged that here was a massive Bill that needed careful and detailed consideration. It is unusual to give two days to a Second Reading debate. I took it as a sign that the Government intended to give the Bill due and proper consideration. Therefore, I expected that we would—in the Minister's words—make steady progress through the Committee stage. Until yesterday, I expected that there would be no afternoon sittings, at least for a few weeks—or maybe even a month or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers must realise that the message given to the education world and to others by deciding to have afternoon sittings so soon is that they intend to rush the Bill through Committee. That is a great pity considering that we took two days for Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the feelings of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). As a new Member getting used to the procedures and dealing with many pieces of paper, I will find it more difficult, especially to begin with, to give due and careful consideration to the amendments if we are sitting many hours a week. I would welcome a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
transitionary period so that we could give careful consideration to the Bill in morning sittings in the early stages and move to afternoon sittings later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why consideration of the Bill needs to be steady and not rushed lies in its meat and substance. Nobody thinks that it is about education: it is about creating a bureaucracy, laying down new rules and standards, setting up new bodies and introducing new people to run our education system in years to come. It is not about ideas and philosphy, but about details. If those details are wrong and are not properly considered we could throw the education world into an abyss. In recent years, it has had to put up with many changes in the way in which its affairs are governed and if we get the Bill wrong and set up bureaucracies and structures that do not work, we will do a great injustice to the people who work in schools and to the children who go there for their education. We will get the details right only if we take the Bill slowly and steadily and carefully examine each clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should have learnt that the effect of poorly considered legislation is disastrous. I was teaching in a secondary school when the national curriculum was implemented. It had a terrible effect on the morale of teachers and pupils because we were constantly told—day after day and week after week—that the classroom work that we had prepared under the national curriculum had to be changed, changed, and changed again. We had to teach children and prepare them for examinations while being told to hold our horses and not to get through the curriculum too quickly because changes would be made in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such problems were detrimental to the quality of teaching and certain pupils received a lower quality of education in their secondary schools than they would have done if the national curriculum had been considered carefully. I do not want that to happen to the Bill. It is essential that its details are carefully considered; that will not be done if we rush through it. To meet as frequently as we shall if the sittings motion is carried will mean that the details of the Bill will not receive the attention that they merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have rightly referred to consultation. The hon. Member for Bath said that more than 1,000 people responded to the White Paper and that the Secretary of State took that as evidence that sufficient time had been given for consultation. The measure of whether there has been effective consultation is not how many people write to the Department for Education giving their point of view, but how carefully their comments are considered by the Government. It is clear that there was not enough time for the Government to examine the many comments that were made during consultation. The details of the Bill are the same as those of the White Paper; the Government have made no changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point. The press release issued by the Department of Education that dealt with the extent to which the Government had listened to observations, referred to changes as "some refinements".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The process of consultation and taking note of what is said during consultation, gives an Act its legitimacy. I fear that the Government's attitude towards consultation between the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
publication of the White Paper and that of the Bill, means that the Bill is not needed, not wanted and not welcome, and will also have no legitimacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go steadier, the Government will have an opportunity to consider the further comments that will be made during the next few weeks. We are willing to help the Government with that. The Opposition seek to prevent the Government from repeating the mistake that they made when they published the White Paper; the length of consultation on it was tragically short. We are keen to save the Government from their own folly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has decided not to serve on the Committee. He has spoken loudly, clearly and frequently at every opportunity on the writing of the Bill, on the announcement of the White Paper and the publicity and propaganda that surrounded it, and on the introduction of the Bill. Yet at this stage, he has chosen to remain silent. That puzzles me. Like many people outside the House, I have pondered the reasons for that. I can think of three explanations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I fail to see the relevance of that point to the sittings motion. I hope that the hon. Lady will explain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that one of the reasons that the Secretary of State has chosen not to serve on the Committee is that its timing does not suit him. In an effort to be helpful and flexible, and in a friendly spirit of co-operation, we are willing to change our timetables and diaries to receive the benefit of his comments in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee stage gives us the opportunity to question carefully the Secretary of State's comments, and some of his wilder allegations. If we were of a suspicious nature, our inability to do that would lead us to the conclusion that he was avoiding the Committee, where his arguments and allegations could be challenged in detail. The Secretary of State's absence gives the education world the impression that he does not care and that he wishes to avoid detailed debate. I do not believe that that is true. I believe that he cannot give so many hours in a week to a Committee. The Government should accept our offer to spread the Committee stage and thus facilitate the arrival of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage in the passage of the Bill we have an opportunity to make a momentous decision. A vote against the sittings motion would ensure due and careful consideration of the Bill as it progresses towards the statute book. That would enable Members of Parliament to carry out their proper role as members of a Standing Committee. It would also give a message to people in education and beyond that the Bill is being considered carefully. Such consideration adds to legitimacy of any Bill that reaches the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that the debate this morning has been somewhat bogus. It has been an attempted continuation of speeches made on Second Reading, whereas our real task is to get on with discussing the Bill. The sittings motions should have allowed us to do that more than an hour ago. The education world in particular will wonder what the Labour party is trying to hide by delaying the debate on the substance of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Committee that Labour Members intend to debate every aspect of the Bill thoroughly. We hope that the Government will not resort to a guillotine, although we suspect that they will. The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) spoke with some authority and feeling on Second Reading about the aspects of the Bill that deal with special needs education. Does he accept that the absence of the Secretary of State is a fundamental obstacle to securing changes to the Bill? It is the Secretary of State's Bill: he wrote the White Paper and stamped it with his personal authority. The hon. Gentleman must accept, as Opposition Members have said time and again, that the Secretary of State's absence is a problem that must be overcome. We shall do that by altering the sittings motion, if necessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will vote with us to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sittings motion is about the timing of our debates, not about personalities. I have every confidence in our distinguished team of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons that have been given for not sitting in the afternoons are more bogus than any that I have ever heard. The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) said that he had to meditate. The Labour party tends to go into retreat and the hon. Gentleman may join it, but he can meditate over weekends and on Mondays so that on Tuesdays he can come to the Committee having made up his mind and considered all the views that have been put to us by teaching and other external bodies. That would allow us to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge said that she is in her constituency on Thursday afternoons. Another Labour Member said that he wanted to be in the Chamber on

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Thursday afternoons. Those are the attitudes of part-time Members. I suggest to the hon. Member for Cambridge that some Members of Parliament work in the House full time, from Monday to Friday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be difficult for the hon. Gentleman to understand that hon.

Friend the Member for Cambridge and the hon. Member for Battersea. My hon. Friend spoke about Thursday evenings, but the hon. Member for Battersea spoke about Thursday afternoons. I remind the hon. Gentleman that there is a considerable difference between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I want to do is to delay consideration of the Bill. The education world wants us to test the Bill in the Committee, as Conservative Members have promised to do. We want to examine it and to use all the available time, including afternoons, to do so. I do not mind going through the night if that means that we can ensure that a good Bill can be made perfect. There is a wide range of experience among Conservative Members. We should let that experience loose on the Bill and get on with our discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is the custom to congratulate you, Sir John, although I fear that you will wonder, when the Committee proceedings are over, why you were appointed to the Chair. I hope that you enjoy your task, although I should not relish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that it is customary to declare a personal interest. I am not sure whether I have a direct pecuniary interest. I am a member of the NUT, but am not sponsored by that organisation. My wife has been a secondary school teacher for 17 years, and my child goes to a state school in my constituency. I therefore have a direct interest in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's only justification for the sittings motion was that he wanted to be flexible. It is a strange use of the word "flexible" if, from Thursday, we will be involved in morning, afternoon and evening sittings. Perhaps the word "flexible" is newspeak, and means that the Government want to rush the Bill through the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "flexible" could also be a euphemism for bulldozing the Bill on to the statute book. I am staggered that the Committee should go so soon into morning, afternoon and evening sittings on such an important Bill. I have read the reports of the Committee stages of the Education Act 1944, when detailed and timely consideration was given to that legislation. The Committee is entitled to ask why the Government are in such a rush now. They cannot be interested in giving the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Bill detailed consideration. If they were, they would allow sufficient time to consider the information that is put forward. But if we are to meet mornings, afternoons and evenings, how will we have the time to give detailed consideration to the proposals before the Committee? The timetable has been designed to prevent consideration, not to enhance it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speculate on why the sittings motion was proposed. It is possible that the Government recognise that the Bill is fatally flawed and realise that they will have to table many amendments to it. Another reason for the rush may be that there is a desperate need for the Bill to be on the statute book before a change in the leadership of the Tory party and, therefore, changes in the Department for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion tells me, as a new Member, that the Government have learnt nothing from the fact that on 9 April their majority was greatly reduced. They no longer command a majority of 140 in the House of Commons; they must scrape around on certain occasions to achieve a majority of three so that their proposals may proceed. They should take time to reflect on why the Bill is being rushed through. Will the House of Commons allow that to happen? A rejection of the sittings motion would permit the detailed and timely consideration of the Bill in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends said, sixteen Education Bills have been enacted in the past 13 years, but not all of them were rushed through Parliament. The Education Act 1981 was the result of the Warnock committee, set up by the Labour Government, and chaired by Lady Warnock, which considered special educational needs and how they could be met by education statute. The resulting Bill was enacted in 1981, when Mark Carlisle, one of my predecessors in the constituency of Warrington, South, was Secretary of State for Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to compare the way in which the Education Act 1944 arrived on the statute book with the proceedings of this Bill. This Committee needs time to consider the Bill in detail; the 1944 Act stood the test of time. We heard about Rab Butler's personal consultations. In 1941, the Government produced an internal memorandum setting out their thinking on education. There was a three-year consultation process, followed by the 1943 education White Paper which had a three-month consultation period before the Bill was introduced in the House of Commons. Rab Butler gave a detailed analysis of the Bill when he presented it to the House. Such analysis was sadly lacking from the speech made by this Secretary of State for Education on Second Reading. That is another reason why the Committee needs time to consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education Act 1944 was preceded by three major investigations of the needs of future education, including those of Spens and Norwood, which took place over 10 years. The subsequent Bill was the result of a coalition of interests that considered how post-war education should be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told on Second Reading that there would be an opportunity for further consultation and that the Committee stage would provide for such a process to be elongated and enhanced. I thought that that was a strange way for the Government to proceed but I welcomed it nonetheless. I thought that it would be a genuine offer to interested parties to give the Committee the benefit of their thoughts on how education should be provided in the mid-1990s and into the 21st century. That will not happen
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
if the sittings motion is accepted, because our programme will be concertina-ed and little time will be allowed for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education demands that the Committee is allowed to do its work and is given the time and space in which to do it. The Bill is not only about education but about constitutional change. Part of our constitution is based on the fact that local education authorities deliver education services. Those authorities are directly elected by the people in their localities. The Bill would change that and the Committee should consider the relevant clause in great detail. Any Government in the western world who claim to support democracy but who legislate to remove it should be given the chance to reconsider their thinking. Democracy demands that the sittings motion be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John for allowing me to contribute to this important debate on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach my contribution with trepidation, as I am a new Member. The Government, too, should approach the Bill with more trepidation than they have exhibited. The Bill makes a sweeping change in how education is provided and local democracy works. In Wales, opposition to the Bill has been overwhelming: from the moment when the White Paper was published there was a public furore. I received documents from various organisations involved with education in Wales and there was no support whatever for the White Paper or for the Bill. The greatest anxiety was expressed about the complete elimination of democratic control of the educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the point made by the hon. Member for Torfaen—it is most unsatisfactory that, at the Committee stage, we are still unaware of the nature of the proposals for reform of local government in Wales. That is an astonishing inversion of the proper order. It calls for hesitation now and a slow progress through the Bill to enable us to consider the proposals for the new local authorities that we hope will soon be presented to us. We do not even know the boundaries of those local authorities and we certainly do not know what powers they will have. We do not know how they will tackle the provision of education. There has been talk of lead authorities being responsible for education and of establishing joint boards of new local authorities. It is unreasonable that before the decisions have been taken we should rush to discuss, in detail, how educational provision will be changed. There will be an intricate relationship between the new structure of local government, when and if it comes to pass, and how education is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that it is the Government's intention entirely to remove schools from the control of local government but the White Paper insists that the route to that goal must be by parental ballot. That means that the process of transference from local education authority control to that of direct grant may be a long, drawn-out and painful process in which there will be enormous scope for confusion and much duplication. There will be great resistance in Wales to an increasing number of schools with grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must carefully consider how the two systems—the grant-maintained system and the local educational system—in conjunction with the reform of local government, will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
run side-by-side. That will require consultation. We must consider how to mitigate the enormous damage that could be done by the Bill. Apart from being responsible for schools, education authorities in Wales support all kinds of community activities with an educational content. In my constituency, the county council and the education authority make generous provisions for the activities of various youth movements, cultural activities and organisations such as the young farmers clubs and the remarkable movement called Urdd, which receive substantial subvention from local government. My constituency has a remarkable theatre which provides many services for schoolchildren and adults. That theatre would not survive were it not for the support of the county council. I shudder to think what would happen if that support were swept aside in the change to a grant-maintained system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those matters need to be considered carefully to assess whether we should table amendments to ensure that such provision is continued under the grant-maintained regime. To do that we need to consult organisations and individuals with expertise in education. We should be able to visit our constituencies regularly, and get home on a Friday if possible, so that we can enter into constructive dialogue with constituents who can provide us with ideas and feedback. I do not accept that being in our constituencies represents a failure to fulfill our parliamentary duties; it is an essential part of them. I want to talk to headmasters, headmistresses and members of the teaching unions so that we may table constructive amendments to mitigate the damage that the Bill might do to education provision in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that needs to be dealt with seriously—it cannot be done unless there is regular consultation with experts in education—is the strategic function of local education authorities in the provision of education in the Welsh medium. We have made great strides in recent years. I pay tribute to members of the Government, such as the Minister of State at the Welsh Office, who have made a constructive and important contribution to the development of Welsh-medium education. The increase in the number of Welsh speaking schoolchildren and the gradual development of Welsh-medium education are due to the strategic planning of local education authorities, without which the whole system might have fallen apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the tribute that I paid to the Minister and the Government, but it is too soon to know what the effect of Welsh as a foundation subject will be. The gradual development of Welsh-medium education is thanks to the strategic decisions of local education authorities. Strategic planning varies according to the linguistic composition of the population of an area. In Gwynedd and Dyfed, Welsh-medium education at primary level is the norm; the vast majority of pupils are educated through the medium of Welsh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure that it is relevant to the sittings motion. I hope that hon. Members will not make the debate too wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir John, if I am straying from the essential point, which is that the Bill will transform the provision of education. Welsh-medium education is relevant to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper and the Bill do not state which body will be responsible for the strategic functions that local education authorities now carry out. It is unclear to what extent market forces are supposed to solve the problem, or whether they are expected to be a substitute for planning. What regional and local structure will be linked to the funding council? We should be in constant dialogue with constituents, and with experts in education to find out how we can inject into the Bill provisions to enable a strategic function to be carried out. I will find it difficult to have enough time to consult constituents about the details of the Bill, unless we proceed leisurely and take sufficient time over the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The theory of the democratic process is that a constructive dialogue takes place between Government and Opposition. I hope that that will occur. We should constantly consult people in Wales and England about the details of the Bill. If that occurs, we might be able—this is an optimistic interpretation—to mitigate some of the damaging effects of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Thankfully, I am not a member of AMMA. I am a member of and consultant to the NUT and to the Association of Educational Psychologists, which are far superior to the organisations to which the hon. Member for Battersea and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the sittings motion's sinister aim has been revealed this morning. The Government aim to put in as many hours as possible, as quickly as possible, and then introduce a guillotine. They intend to cram us into Committee for the next few weeks and then a guillotine motion will be presented on the Floor of the House so that the Bill reaches the statute book as quickly as possible. The hon. Member for Battersea let the cat out of the bag when he claimed that he was prepared to sit during the early hours of the morning. The Government intend not only to keep us in Committee on Tuesday mornings and afternoons, and on Thursday mornings and afternoons, but during the early hours of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point. The sittings motion requires us to sit on Thursday afternoons. While Conservative Members, particularly the hon. Member for Battersea, made great claim about the prospect of Thursday evenings, Opposition Members, such as my hon. Friend and myself, who represent northern constituencies have to return to their constituencies on Friday. We have much greater difficulties than the hon. Gentleman who can walk on the river to get to his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have those powers!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it may be more accurate to say that the hon. Gentleman may punt across the river. Our ability to return on Thursdays to our constituencies makes a fundamental difference to keeping in touch with our constituents. No Conservative Members on the Committee come from the north of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. Did my hon. Friend say, "Walk on the river" or, "Walk over the river"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said, "Walk on the river".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that many Conservatives believe that they can walk on water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had to cancel an important appointment for the early part of Friday morning because I realised that I would be unable to return to my constituency in time. I have told my secretary to keep other Friday mornings blank because I suspect that I shall not be around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee reminds me of the Committee on the Education Reform Bill, of which I was a member, because virtually the same tactics were used. The difference between the two is that we had the pleasure of the company of the then Secretary of State in the Committee of the Education Reform Bill. The former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) was a conscientious attender of the Committee. On many occasions I remember that he rushed from Cabinet meetings to speak in the debate. He also came with briefs from the Prime Minister of the time, on what he had to say at those meetings. Perhaps it might be as well that the present Secretary of State will not be attending as regularly as his right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley. When I talk of "briefs", I hope that people take that to mean discussion briefs about the Bill and not, given some Members smirks, something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation on the Education Reform Bill took place during the summer months, and exactly the same tactics were used for the consultation on this Bill. What has happened is clear: the Government do not want proper consultation, so they issued the White Paper and asked for consultation during June, July and August, when schools had broken up and the majority of LEA officers were on holiday. The consultation exercise is a sham and a sop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim is to get the Bill on the statute book as quickly as possible because opting out has been an acute embarrassment and a failure for them. After the Tories won the general election, we were told that there would be an avalanche of thousands of schools applying to opt out in favour of grant-maintained status. That has not happened; schools are reluctant to opt out. The Government want the Bill on the statute book as quickly as possible to force schools to opt out of local authority control—that is the intent behind the sittings motion. The Government intend to rush the Bill through the Committee as a result of that motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure of the effectiveness of consultation. I suppose that, in many respects, I am arguing against my own arguments. The Government do not listen to consultation, but merely go through the motions of doing so. We saw that happen with previous housing, privatisation and education Bills and with the local government Bill that introduced the poll tax. There is a pretence of listening to representations, followed by the ignoring of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
Attempting to allow more time for consultation may be wasting many people's time. I know from reading the briefs that we receive from organisations that are interested in education matters, and deeply worried about what the Bill will do to education, that they must spend many hours preparing briefs and consultations for hon. Members and for Ministers to take note of and I am sure that Ministers do not even read them. Nothing that they suggest appears to be part of the changes or the Bill. A White Paper was published and after it the Bill and, frankly, there was no difference between them. The views of thousands of people whom they are supposed to have consulted have been ignored: not an iota of notice has been taken of them. Perhaps the Government are doing them a favour by not allowing more time for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most important that we scrutinise the Bill, although, from experience, I have no illusions about what will happen. Opposition Members will table constructive and valid amendments that would improve the Bill. I would prefer to negate the Bill but I know, Sir John, that you would not allow amendments for that purpose. Therefore, we shall try to improve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no changes to the Bill. The Government will reject Opposition amendments and blandly and blindly go their own way. The only changes will be those brought forward by Government representatives to put right mistakes as they are found in the Bill, and, as with the Education Reform Act 1988, I suspect that as many clauses will be added to correct the Bill as are already in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I have a feeling of déàja vu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the reasoning behind it, the sittings motion has sinister overtones. The Government want the Bill to go through quickly so as to speed opt-outs. They also want a mechanism in place to coincide with the proposed changes in local government. I make no bones about accusing the Government of hating local government. They have an innate dislike of it. For 10 years they have tried to get rid of it. Whenever possible, they destroyed parts of it. They have now made it impossible for local authorities to give a democratic service. They have hammered local government and held it back for 13 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Government plan that small unitary authorities will take over from county councils. I suspect also a sinister motive—that those small authorities will not be given responsibility for education, or discouraged from taking it on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government want the Bill through the House as quickly as possible so that the funding agency is in being and ready when local government reorganisation takes place because they want the agency to take over all the functions of local education authorities. I think that they have been tipped off. The Secretary of State let the cat out of the bag at a Select Committee meeting recently when he said that Tory local education authorities were already requesting information about how to get rid of their education service. That is one of the sinister motives behind the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want the funding agency in being so that it can take over the education facility that the new reorganised local government unitary authorities will not want to administer. Education is to be handed over to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
non-elected and non-democratic organisations. That is why the Government want to rush through the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They do not want to scrutinise the Bill; they want it in the statute book as quickly as possible for those sinister reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate you, Sir John, on being selected to chair the Committee. I look forward to serving as a member of it. In common with other members of the Committee, I am wearing my political L-plates, so I look forward to your guidance, Sir John, on many matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My opposition to the sittings motion stems from the lack of consultation since the White Paper was published last July. I shall be brief and to the point because others have said much of what I intended to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation lasted barely nine weeks, but an urgent need exists to continue that consultation for much longer. Those nine weeks embraced six weeks of school holiday. They took no account of the county and metropolitan councils' cycle of meetings at which they could consider the White Paper, nor the cycle of school governors' meetings at which they too, could give the proposals proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read many of the responses to the White Paper and to the Bill and I am worried that so many are utterly opposed to the proposals. The fact that many who are separate from and independent of this place and its politics oppose the Bill should give us cause for reflection. The Institute of Directors was the only organisation that welcomed the broad thrust of the Bill, yet even it criticised the little time given for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Member of Parliament who represents a constituency that is a long way from the House and who, therefore, has to travel long distances, unlike the hon. Member for Battersea, I can say that, the further away one is from the House, the greater the opposition to the Bill and to the idea of centralisation of control. That is why we need a longer consultation period to listen to people. Many councillors in the county of Devon, in which my constituency lies—not all of them of my political persuasion—are deeply concerned about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill raises many issues and sitting on Tuesdays and Thursdays, morning and afternoon, would give us insufficient time to talk to the many people with whom we need to consult. If we take a headlong rush at the Bill, without giving proper consideration to each aspect of each clause, we shall send a signal to the world of education about the importance that the Government attach to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread cynicism among educationists about the Government's education proposals of recent years and about the way in which they have been introduced. The Minister may be aware of the phrase "innovation overload". Friday used to be the day when another new Government proposal arrived in the post, which had to be considered at short notice. Consider the changes made to the science curriculum in its key stages: the reduction in targets; the curriculum changes in mathematics, the English GCSE and in standard assessment tasks. The Government were wrong about those matters the first time round. We must, therefore, consider them carefully now.

The Government need to get the Bill right, because their credibility hangs on it. The Opposition need to get it right because our children attend the schools that the Bill affects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted, Sir John, to hear about your reputation for firmness and fairness. Novices such as myself may need to rely on that to protect the interests of Back Benchers in Committee, as the Government try to railroad the Bill through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) hit the nail on the head when he claimed that the Government wish to get enough hours under their belt to introduce a guillotine. The Bill is a case of, "Never mind the quality, feel the width." The Bill has 255 clauses and 17 schedules. The Government will add more to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When will the Government learn that they have to table amendments to Bills because they have rushed the measures through? They now wish to rush through the Committee stage. The Bill's provisions for special educational needs, include inadequate definitions of special needs, codes of practice, integration procedures, governors' responsibilities, assessments, statements, reviews, tribunals and new powers for the Secretary of State, all of which warrant a Bill of their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell me whether the Bill provides for additional finances to cover the extra responsibilities that dealing with special educational needs entail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point. Even when legislation such as the Education Act 1980 is broadly welcomed, the Government do not provide for the resources that are necessary to make it successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent more than two hours yesterday with the chief education officer of Lancashire local education authority, which is one of the largest local education authorities in the country. It has a budget of £600 million per year and employs over 20,000 people. On can imagine the amount of consultation that worthwhile constituency Members of Parliament would wish to hold with their local education authority about the Bill, which covers so many matters. I can only guess at the briefings that hon. Members will receive during the Committee stage. By Second Reading, I had given up measuring the briefings that I received in pages and begun to measure them in inches. I received a stack that was 6 in deep from many organisations including the NUT, AMMA and the Association of Educational Psychologists. The Secretary of State said on Second Reading that the Government wanted some provisions, especially those that cover special needs, to be tackled in a non-partisan way. That is almost impossible unless informed debate takes place. That will not happen if the Bill is rushed through Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge made the excellent point that new Members of Parliament would find it difficult to come to terms with the different procedures that apply in Committee. New Members want to take their responsibilities seriously. We cannot do that if we are bounced through the debate. We should not be asked to take some decisions lightly. The Government are happy for the Committee to remove powers from local people on a Thursday morning and give them to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
Secretary of State on a Thursday afternoon, although the Secretary of State does not have the courtesy to attend the Committee to have those powers conferred on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept that the Bill is flawed. The future of children's education, especially that of children with special educational needs, is too important for the Government to bounce the Bill through Committee in a high-handed way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak very briefly about the implications of the Bill for London. One of our reasons for opposing the sittings motion is the speed at which the Bill is being rushed through. We have not had the opportunity to discuss, either with the educational establishment or with other interested parties, the effects of the Bill. I received a letter about the Bill today from a parents' organisation. The author ended the letter by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I apologise for the short notice, but the speed with which this Bill is moving … meant that I was unable to circulate the information earlier."</p></blockquote>
So much for the consultation in which the Government take such pride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take more time over the Bill so that we can consider what is happening on behalf of all London's education authorities, 13 of which were spawned after the Government abolished the Inner London education authority only two and a half years ago. Those 13 authorities are still coming to grips with the many changes that the Government have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what my fellow new Members have said about wanting to learn about the workings of the Committee process. I repeat, on behalf of Londoners and London's children, that we need more time to discuss the Bill's implications with teachers and parents. We cannot afford to allow any more changes to take place so rapidly. During the election campaign, one of the most common requests from people was, "Please—no more changes in education yet." I hope that the Government will listen to the opinions of parents and teachers in London and elsewhere on this very important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo everything that has been said, Sir John, about your record as a firm and fair Chairman. I, too, am looking forward to the Chairmanship of this Committee by you and by Mr. Martin, who shares your attributes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Battersea that the education world is watching our procedures with great keenness. I can also tell the hon. Gentleman that I am willing, after this morning's sitting has ended, to construct with him a simply worded question to send to all the people who have sent in their comments about the Bill. That question would ask whether they would prefer us to meet in the mornings only between now and Christmas so that we would have sufficient time to table the amendments that they want. That would allow us to assess the progress that we have made by Christmas, after which we could begin afternoon sittings. I am willing to accept the verdict of all the outside organisations and parties in the educational world. Furthermore, I would accept their verdict as to whether we should continue to consider seriously all the clauses of the Bill without resorting to a guillotine. I hope that the hon. Member for Battersea

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
would oppose any attempt to impose a guillotine to reduce discussion of the Bill as we progress to the later stages of our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noted that AMMA, in the notes that it sent to us, has not taken the advice of its parliamentary adviser?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it reminds me that I received those notes late yesterday and this morning. That shows the pressure that everyone is under in preparing for the Bill. The Government have moved swiftly to Committee stage and they intend to push through the Bill at a speed designed to limit full consideration of these sweeping changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are fully prepared to be as flexible as possible to enable the Secretary of State for Education to be party to our discussions as it is his White Paper—personally written, we are told—and the Bill will provide a framework for the next 20 years. It is only proper that he makes some effort to attend the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury has made a considerable sacrifice to be here today because it is her daughter Isabel's ninth birthday; duty called and she gave up that important family occasion. The Secretary of State should have a similar attitude towards his duties; he is at the pinnacle of our education system. It is a great pity that he is not here to deal with the points raised by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion provides for double and treble sittings from Thursday. I notice that the Minister of State, Welsh Office, is flicking through the Audit Commission report, "Getting on with the Act", on the best practice for LEAs and teachers regarding special needs education. I received a copy this morning. I had a quick look at it, and it contains no word about the role of funding agencies in the provision of special needs education. I would be interested to know whether their role is dealt with. Important developments in special needs education will be made redundant by the Bill. The Audit Commission's report will have to be rewritten within months to take account of the funding agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is aware that many of the recommendations in that document are incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing that, but its recommendations, however excellent, exclude any reference to the funding agencies that will be set up under the Bill. It is clear that there will come a time—virtually straightaway for a handful of local authorities—when the funding agency will have an important role in the provision of school places. It would, therefore, be far better to begin our discussions in a less hectic way to give people, especially those in special needs education, the opportunity to give thoughtful consideration to the role of the funding agencies. As the Bill stands, they will be completely inadequate to provide for children with special educational needs, whether or not they are statemented. There is no statutory obligation for LEAs to act on behalf of children under the age of five; that important area is virtually left untouched. Such a child would benefit from help, but does not require a statement at that age. Therefore, even at this late stage, I hope that the Government would have second thoughts about their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
sittings motion and give us at least a few weeks of morning sittings only to allow the educational world to respond in a considered way to this massive Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that, in my quieter moments, I am a bit of a traditionalist, but, it is for the Opposition to judge whether they are wise to follow the tradition in the House of indulging in gratuitous time wasting on the first day of a Bill. That does not impress me or my hon. Friends who are keen to get on with the detailed consideration of the Bill. It will be for people outside the House to judge what is happening today; I suspect that that judgment will be fairly harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an implication underlying the Opposition's remarks that when hon. Members are elected to the House their job does not belong to or take place here. It is very strange to hear experienced and inexperienced Opposition Members saying that the idea of being involved in Committee work in the mornings and, goodness me, afternoons as well—and maybe, even the occasional evening—is objectionable to them. Perhaps they have not noticed, but, until we arrange our business otherwise, the House sits in the evenings, often till 10 o'clock or later. To imply that to do that is an added burden on hon. Members tells us a great deal about Opposition Members' attitude to their work in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather bizarre that Opposition Members cannot contemplate sitting beyond the mornings for the forseeable future. Apparently they want to meditate, in the case of the hon. Member for Hemsworth, or consult outside interest groups from whom they are obviously still waiting for their speaking scripts. They have Mondays, Wednesdays and even the odd Friday to do such things. Conservative Members work on Mondays and on Fridays, and, indeed, on Wednesdays. We shall listen to outside interests on those days and then give full consideration to the Bill on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's synthetic rant would be slightly more credible if he could answer one question. He accuses us of not working, but where is the Secretary of State? Is it true that the Secretary of State is unable to be with us because he could not rearrange his hairdresser's appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not particularly want to answer such a trivial and personal attack on my right hon. Friend. I shall say a few things about it and then I shall pass on, because I am not going to waste time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am flattered and honoured that the Secretary of State has entrusted the conduct of the Bill to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Welsh Office, to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education—who will share responsibility for large parts of the Bill with me—and me. We regard that as an honour and we are happy to accept the burden that the Secretary of State has laid upon us. Incidentally, it will give the Secretary of State the maximum opportunity to do what he likes doing best and which he does well and seriously—to continue visiting schools and talking to groups of interested people from the world of education, as he has done since he took office in April. Although he is vitally interested in the Committee's work, his judgment—which I and my hon. Friends share—is that, given the balance of probabilities, the Secretary of State will be able to continue his excellent work in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
dealing with all those interest groups outside the House. He will do that from Mondays to Fridays, and at weekends as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members made a number of points that are worth tackling, even if only briefly. The hon. Members for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) and for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) remembered with nostalgia the coalition Government of the 1940s. They seemed to think that the Committee could learn a lesson from that Administration. No wonder the hon. Members hark back to those days: coalition is probably the only way in which they will see the inside of Government in the foreseeable future. I can understand their misty-eyed nostalgia, but a progressive, forward looking Conservative Government need not look to the 1940s for guidance on the conduct of business. We know what we want to do and we shall press on and do it. The hon. Member for Wallsend got a bit confused about landmarks and cakes. I can only suggest that the Bill is a landmark piece of cake, and I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman's analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members spent much time on the vexed question of the consultation period. I remind the Committee that, after their election victory in April, the Government were faced with the urgent need to provide a statutory framework for the growing grant-maintained schools sector, and with the need to identify and to improve the special educational needs provision. I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that the latter problem required and deserved urgent attention. Therefore, we moved quickly, if deliberately—and deliberatively—to produce the White Paper and the consultation document on special educational needs as soon as possible after the election. We allowed a reasonable period for consultation, and received many replies. We allowed two days for Second Reading—a rare event, and one not acknowledged by Opposition Members. We have now begun our Committee proceedings, and I do not believe that people who are interested in education will look at that series of events and conclude that we have allowed items that required attention to languish during some indefinite period of discussion, meditation or consultation. They will think that we have acted responsibly in pressing on with the development of our policy from White Paper to consultation and from two days of Second Reading debate to Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the lengthy contributions from Opposition Members—which have prevented us from getting on with consideration of the Bill—has been vacuous and irrelevant. Like me, Conservative Members want to get down to scrutinising the Bill, with whatever freedom and flexibility may be required. After today's appallingly slow start, it is not improbable that we may have to progress more quickly than Opposition Members may wish, to compensate for the time that has been wasted in the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir John, it would have been unseemly of me to suggest any such thing. I was referring to the use of time by Opposition Members—frequently guided, as they had to be, by you. I did not intend to criticise you, Sir John.

The sittings motion under discussion is neither unprecedented nor unusual. It is perfectly normal and straightforward. It should command the support of the Committee, so that we can get on with our appointed task. I hope that the Committee will see fit to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
