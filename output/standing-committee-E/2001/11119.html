2002 Draft Budget</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ruth Kelly)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nice that you are in the Chair, Mrs. Roe. I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the 2002 European Community budget, the Council's draft budget that was established in July and the Commission's preliminary draft budget that preceded it. As the Committee may have gathered, the budget documentation is not everyday reading. It is also extremely bulky. I hope that Committee members have had time to put it in order and that it is in a usable format. During our debate, I shall endeavour to respond to detailed points that are made about the budget.<br><br>
The Government's views on the totality of the budget and specific issues were set out in the explanatory memorandum, along with the main figures. As Committee members know, much of the EC budget is effectively determined by legislative decisions concerning agriculture, structural and cohesion funds, and research. Other programmes concerning internal policies and external actions are also subject to legislative decisions with multi-annual envelopes. Staff costs—salaries and pensions—are affected by inflation and must be paid.<br><br>
The United Kingdom wants to ensure that those legislative decisions are respected in the budget, while restricting the growth of other discretionary spending and pressing for more efficient use to be made of all resources. We are determined that the annual budget must respect the 2000–06 financial perspective that was agreed at the 1999 Berlin European Council. The Berlin ceilings are unprecedented as they require annual spending to be kept in line.<br><br>
Rather than bombard the Committee with numerous totals and percentage changes in the 2001 budget compared with the Commission's preliminary draft budget, I wish to highlight the fact that the Council's draft budget totals 99 billion euros in new commitments and 99.5 billion euros in payments, representing 1.4 per cent. of the Community's gross national product. Those figures respect fully the Berlin financial perspective ceilings. They are, however, significant and the Government continue to impress on colleagues in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament that it is quality, not quantity, that matters and that the efficiency and effectiveness of European Community spending still have considerable room for improvement.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.30 pm at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind Committee members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. All hon. Members are likely to have ample opportunity to ask several questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. I was under the impression that it was my role to respond to the Minister as opposed to asking her questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will have up to one hour to ask the Minister questions, after which time a debate will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall therefore waive the question-and-answer session.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins<span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say how pleased I am that you are in the Chair, Mrs. Roe. I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to the Committee.<br><br>
Some of us are familiar with such proceedings. I noticed from the report of the scrutiny committee meeting in July that, as a result of the Commission's delay in producing papers, we were unable to debate the preliminary draft budget and only now are we to debate the draft budget. Does my hon. Friend have a relaxed attitude to such matters or have the Government protested to the Commission about its failure to issue the papers in time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, the debate is taking place later this year than it usually does because of the general election and the summer recess. Although numerous documents are available for the sitting, the budget process is moving faster than the availability of documents. We supplied the documents to the Committee earlier than is formally required, and we have endeavoured to place as many as we can in the public domain as quickly as possible. Because the process moves so fast, the European Union cannot provide a full set of documents all the time, but we endeavour to make it as easy as we can for hon. Members to take part in today's debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jane Griffiths<span class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the chair, Mrs. Roe. The European Commission has requested 317 new posts for 2002, which will require considerable expenditure. The Government want those posts to be justified. How can they or other parties ensure that the posts are justified, and what is the time scale and process for doing so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would like those new posts to be created. They have not been formally approved because the EC has not yet told us about the 400 posts that were to be created and filled last year. It would not be sensible to allocate money for the new 317 posts until we have sufficient information to judge whether the 400 posts have been filled. We are determined to streamline EC processes and crack down on fraud and irregularities. The creation of the new posts is essential to that process.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Economic Secretary to the Treasury welcome the additional funds allocated to combat the foot and mouth epidemic, and will she ensure that we get the share that we need to cover the massive impact on our rural community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for mentioning that important point. Countries that suffer from animal diseases can reclaim sums from the veterinary fund for disease control purposes. The UK is intent on reclaiming significant sums from the EU for foot and mouth disease. Some 800 million euros were allocated in 2001, and a further 800 million euros are allocated for 2002. We shall make sure that we draw down those funds as quickly as we can.<br><br>
Money from the veterinary fund is treated differently from allocations from the rest of the EC budget. Money is not allocated in advance; people claim from the fund after the event. The process must be audited, and the EC must be convinced that the money will not be wasted. That is underway, and we hope to draw down a substantial tranche of money shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I belatedly welcome you to the chair, Mrs. Roe. Does the Economic Secretary agree that it is difficult to claim all that we can from the EU because in many cases up to 75 per cent. of the sum that we can claim is deducted from the abatement? A restructuring of financial support for agriculture is likely to result from the new trade round. Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity that that presents to work towards securing Britain's rebate in a form that makes it in our interests to claim all that we can for our farmers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. There will be pressure for reform at the agriculture round as a result of the world trade talks. We should welcome that. The UK is in the vanguard in pressing for further agricultural reform, and we shall continue to press our case.<br><br>
The abatement is justified on the grounds of fairness under the system of contributions to the EC budget. In terms of relative prosperity, the UK is ranked only tenth on GNP per head, but without the abatement we would be the second largest contributor to the EU budget. That reflects mainly the receipts that we receive, such as those from the common agricultural policy—we receive less than half of the number of CAP receipts of France, and fewer than those of Germany, Spain and Italy—and structural receipts, of which the UK received, at last count, only about 5 percent. of the total funds. We therefore receive less than other member states in respect not only of CAP, but of structural funds. The rationale for abatement was true when it was negotiated in the 1980s, and it remains so today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lepper <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to that which the Committee has extended to the Minister.<br><br>
In her comments on the UK's share of financing of the 2002 budget, the Minister indicates a reduction for the UK of 388 million euros and adds the note:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The gross contribution … includes"—</p></blockquote>
sums—
<br><blockquote><p>"to cover … three reserves (monetary, emergency aid, loan guarantee) but this amount will not be called up unless the reserves are used."</p></blockquote>
Bearing in mind past experience, will she comment on the likelihood of such sums being needed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that astute point. As he knows, the reserves are not a subject for negotiation in the process. We accept the reserves as a contribution because they may be called on. As he says, we use reserves for several different purposes: 250 million euros are allocated as a monetary reserve; 213 million euros as an emergency aid reserve; and 213 million euros as a loan guarantee reserve. I understand that the monetary reserve will disappear after 2002 because it is supposed to reflect the euro-dollar parity, the rationale for which will change. However, the loan guarantee and emergency aid reserves are likely to be called on, so it would be wise to protect them in their current form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the points made about World Trade Organisation and farming subsidies? Following the statement in the House by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on the conclusions of the recent WTO discussions, I understand that, at the last minute, France negotiated a degree of protection for the CAP and arrangements for EU agricultural subsidies. If that is so, can the Minister assure me that we will continue to require our abatement until serious reform of the CAP takes place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes his point well. Given our contribution to the EU budget and the receipts that we receive, and for the sake of fairness, there is a clear and continuing need for UK abatement. As I outlined to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), a significant proportion of the abatement is due to the workings of the CAP and, until serious reform of that occurs, a need for the abatement will remain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boris Johnson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Henley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister has noticed the interesting item on page 108 of volume 1 of the draft budget, about interest on late payments and fines. It refers to the
<br><blockquote><p>"Collection of fines imposed for fraud and irregularities which are damaging to the Community's financial interests".</p></blockquote>
It then reveals that in 2000, a grand total of nil was produced in pursuit of fraud and other activities that are damaging to the Community's financial interests. The document does not specify will happen this year or the next. Does that entertaining statistic reflect the scrupulous way in which the Community's budget is observed by those who spend, and by those who receive, funds—everyone's general probity—or the failure to crack down on fraud? Is that figure of zero good or bad news, and are there plans to do something about it if it is bad news?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point about fraud and irregularity in the EU budget. We are considering the findings of a report
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
from the European Court of Auditors for 2000, which makes it clear that there are too many irregularities in the budget. However, most of them are errors rather than fraud. For example, small over-payments made to farmers in the CAP budget might be subsequently refunded to the EU.<br><br>
If we examine only the irregularities reported for 2000, we cannot yet estimate the likelihood of future irregularities. However, we are determined to see that process streamlined, which is why we support Neil Kinnock's process of reform and modernisation of the Commission's structure. We also support the development of new posts to streamline the budget. Any fraud is unacceptable. The outturn in 2000 for fines, periodic penalty payments and other penalties was 117 million euros, so there is still concern about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend welcome the increase of 20 million euros for freedom, security and justice for which the European Parliament voted? In view of developments since 11 September, should the Budget Council make a further increase to allow for the anti-terrorist drive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Funding in that important area will play an ever-increasing role. However, the Budget Council will not explore that. In due course, we shall reach agreement about it in the European Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Barrett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the large, though decreasing, sum of 984 million euros that is spent on tobacco production, which has a direct, increasing impact on our health service costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The tobacco regime is not our priority, as we are committed to its reform. However, it is strongly supported by other member states, particularly those in underdeveloped regions, which rely on tobacco as a source of income. We shall continue to press for reform of the tobacco regime and I hope that we shall convince our EU partners of the need for change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hywel Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mrs. Roe to the Committee—although, being new to the Committee and to the House, perhaps it would be more appropriate if I welcomed myself.<br><br>
I read with interest the extracts from the European Scrutiny Committee. I refer the Minister to paragraph 50.25, which referred to a 5 per cent, increase in spending on administration. That compares unfavourably with the forecast of 3.8 per cent. My arithmetic suggests an outrageous leap of approximately a quarter in spending on administration compared with the forecast. Has the Economic Secretary been given an explanation for the increase?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: there has been an increase in the budget for administration. The United Kingdom Government believe that it is just as important for European Community institutions to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
have a tight rein on their budgets as it is for member states. We are budget disciplinarians in promoting the case for tight controls on Community expenditures. The aim is to restrict growth in the budget for administration to what is strictly necessary.<br><br>
We must realise that some spending increases are necessary: for example, unavoidable increases in salaries and pensions, which must be paid out of those budgets. There will be necessary pressure on the budget for administration in the process of enlargement, as Community institutions attempt to grapple with that complex agenda. We argue that, in future, the pressure of increasing costs should be met from the budget that is already allocated.<br><br>
However, the draft budget still leaves a margin of 53 million euros below the ceiling permitted for that category of spending. We have also requested a study by secretaries-general of the different Community institutions to identify savings to meet the new pressures on the administrative budget. Until the secretaries-general come up with creative ideas for pooling resources, sharing information and creating real savings, we shall continue to press Community institutions to find a way forward that will reduce pressure on that budget.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the question of budget discipline? My hon. Friend's memorandum of 20 July referred to budget disciplinarian member states, and I am confident that the United Kingdom is such a state. I would like to think that there is an official list, but I suspect that there is not, although the Treasury might have its own quiet list. Does my hon. Friend agree that it should be a priority to ensure that all member states behave well with regard to the budget and that they become budget disciplinarians? If they do not, our net contribution may be even more unfair than we suspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the need to maintain firm discipline when we are dealing with a vast budget that serves a particular purpose. The political and practical realities are that member states that are net contributors to the EU budget tend also to be the ones that are budget disciplinarians, whereas those that receive great benefits from the EU budget in terms of CAP receipts and structural and cohesion funds tend to be those that would allow greater freedom in the use of EU money and are not so concerned with maintaining a tight grip on finances.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend is aware, we attempt, in the process of negotiation, to persuade all our partners of the merits of keeping a tight grip on finances, and we shall continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice in the table of commitment appropriations that there has been a decline of 2 per cent. in commitment appropriations for external action—in other words, foreign aid—but an increase of 9.6 per cent. in payment appropriations. Does the Economic Secretary think that that reflects a more realistic assessment of the payments that it is practical to make? The European Union has been criticised in the past for not delivering the aid that it had planned to provide.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right about the importance of commitments being turned into action on the ground. One reason why traditionally payments have not been as high as commitments is the problem of identifying in advance commitments that will be easily translatable into practical action. We continue to press for more realism in the setting of the budget, which would also leave us more flexibility when a need for increased action arises later in the year or in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but does my hon. Friend not feel a little concerned about the European Parliament's reduction of appropriations for the western Balkans, given that we have a considerable stake in that area's stability after our efforts in Kosovo?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is always a lively debate in the Budget Council as to where commitments are best directed. Some countries argue that we should use the funds to promote political objectives and stability in regions such as the Balkans and certain Mediterranean countries, whereas other countries argue that the objective should be to prioritise poverty alleviation throughout the world. There is a tension between those countries.<br><br>
Of course, it is important that we have sufficient funds to promote stability in the Balkans, but we have also been arguing for a greater focus on poverty in the use of those moneys. When we consider the situation in Afghanistan, for example, we see that both poverty alleviation and bringing stability to the region are important. That is one reason why we shall argue strongly that the budget should be flexible enough to cope with the additional pressures that may arise as a result of the humanitarian and restructuring crisis in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Barrett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One cost that appears to have risen fairly sharply is that of pensions for retired staff, as the Minister mentioned. What is the future trend on pension costs expected to be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Commission is attempting to reform its processes and streamline its functions, directing its money more efficiently and protecting itself against fraud and irregularities. As it does so, it is important to have streamlined appointment processes, the right staff in the right positions and sufficient staff to be able to administer budgets, particularly aid budgets, appropriately. That process of change will involve some people retiring, others moving to different jobs and a general restructuring of positions in Community institutions. I believe that that is one reason for the increase in pension costs, some of which will be immediate and some recurring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If no more Members want to ask questions, we shall proceed to the debate.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
<p>That the Committee takes note of the Draft General Budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2002 (Volumes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9); and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—[<i>Ruth Kelly.</i>]</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p>4.59 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European budget and the underlying financial and other management are clearly in need of major reform in both a macro and a micro context. This debate is merely for hon. Members to take note of the draft budget; there is precious little that we can do about it. Some £8 billion gross of British taxpayers' money is involved, between £3.5 billion and £4 billion net.<br><br>
Sadly, since the resignation of the Santer Commission, notwithstanding the excellent efforts of Neil Kinnock, there has been little improvement or change. The Commission still has absenteeism rates of 5 per cent. and sick leave rates of 6 to 8 per cent. There has been little success in getting rid of employment for life. As the Minister commented, there are another 317 new posts this year after 400 new posts last year, and 234 people are being redeployed. Without looking at the fundamental issues, the Court of Auditors found waste of about 5.5 per cent, which is equivalent to about £3 billion, or £15 per family. In my assessment, the UK Treasury would have no difficulty in cutting about 15 per cent. of the budget in aggregate, and that would be without major fundamental reforms to CAP and structural spending.<br><br>
At a macro level, the EU is apparently planning for a big bang accession in 2004 of 10 members, but massive work is still needed on major issues, such as reforming CAP and structural funding equal to about 80 per cent. of the total. I cannot see how accession of new members can take place in 2004, as progress is still necessary in discussing and agreeing reform in those difficult areas.<br><br>
There are one or two minor positives in the 2002 budget process. The rapporteur, Costa Neves, is a sound, sensible, cost-cutting and disciplined individual who deserves our support. The rapporteur is the person who steers the budget through, monitors it and appraises it afterwards. Last year, the rapporteur was Mrs. Haug. Contrary to comments in earlier debates on European finance, Mrs. Haug is recommending own-resource, direct-tax financing. Her report dated 26 June 2001 to the Committee on Budgets sets out specific programmes for direct taxation.<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, the budget was originally just over 100 billion euros; it is now just under. It is about £60 billion and is up by about 3.3 per cent., with agriculture up by about 5 per cent. There is a boast of great success in getting the proportion of EU GNP down from 1.07 per cent. to 1.06 per cent. initially and now to 1.04 per cent. That is based on an assumption of growth in the EU that is unlikely to be achieved next year. Thus, I expect that the upturn as a percentage of GNP will be higher than last year.<br><br>
There has been poor management not only of micro issues. On the other side of the coin, there was an underspend of some 10 billion euros last year, which was mostly the result of a shambles in defining a region for the purpose of structural spending. Several areas in the UK—in particular, the north-west—were unable to bid in time. I cannot resist pointing out that the person responsible for that was none other than the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
right hon. Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers), the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Not only has the north-west not received structural funds in good time but it appears that it will not get its west coast main line upgrade in good time, either.<br><br>
Other areas of underspending were the result of foolish measures. The SAPARD—the special accession programme for agriculture and rural development—for central Europe was far too complex and bureaucratic for the Governments there to implement.<br><br>
In the course of the EU debate, Conservative MEPs tabled nine key amendments that would have cut approximately 5 billion euros off the agricultural spend, without major change. However, because of a procedural manoeuvre requiring a block vote, they were unable to have the amendments debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Among the savings that I imagine that the Conservative party would wish to make are 38 million euros for the common fisheries policy. Is it still the Conservative's policy to abolish that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to the fisheries policy. The total spend on the policy is about 1 billion euros. I hardly think that any hon. Member could approve how that is spent.<br><br>
One micro aspect that needs reform and has not been addressed is the A30 system of earmarked grants. We have become used to giving fair value to the principles of competitive bidding for grants that are awarded on merit. However, there is still earmarked and gravy-train funding for many pet projects, which too often results in the impropriety of grants and inadequate monitoring. One minor reform has taken place. There was a great objection that the European women's lobby received 100 per cent. of the funding in its territory, and that there was a fair amount of incestuous circular financing. The monopoly has been broken and the lobby will receive two thirds of the funds. That represents 600,000 euros, although 300,000 euros will go elsewhere.<br><br>
The A30s are the vehicle by which various bodies that campaign for greater European integration receive funds for EU houses, for example, and for many publications. There must be a push for reforms—as there has been in this country—to get rid of the corrupt approach to grant funding. The process should be out in the open to ensure that money is properly won on merit.<br><br>
The budget breaks down into headings of agriculture, structure, internal policies, external policies, administration, reserves and pre-accession aid. However, I had a problem when trying to make sense of the figures because all sorts of spending pop up under another heading. Hon. Members may have noted that 3 billion euros of agricultural spending is tucked away under structural spending. Fishery spending does not appear under the agriculture heading, but in three different places. There is a deliberate opaqueness to make it difficult for citizens—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
let alone their Members of Parliament—to understand precisely what money is spent where, let alone how the money is doled out and to whom. That all requires considerable micro reform. In the European Union, financial regulation has not been reviewed for 20 years and there is an unhealthy bias toward letting contracts, rather than allowing contracts to be negotiated to give value for money.<br><br>
I turn to agriculture. In addition to the spending of 45 billion euros, which was listed as 46.2 billion euros, I found a further 3 billion euros listed under structured funds and 0.5 billion euros listed under SAPARD. This is not the time to present major policies to reform CAP, but continuing nonsense exists in the agricultural budget. The near billion euros that are spent on tobacco has been pointed out, and I confess an interest. I would not mind if the tobacco were smoked, but most of it is burnt, which is a pure scam. There are subsidies for crops that are unsuitable for Europe, such as rice, cocoa and beans. The arable spend has risen by 4.8 billion euros to 18 billion euros. Beef subsidies have risen by 24 per cent., while olive oil subsidies are stable at 2.4 billion euros and milk subsidies are fairly stable. At a macro level, the figures show the lack of wisdom of the CAP. Why should many of the items receive a subsidy?<br><br>
I turn to future accession. The estimates show that if the CAP is not reformed an extra 16.6 billion euros will be required to implement it in the 10 potential new member countries. I am pleased that Germany is keen to return agricultural support to individual members for administration by individual members.<br><br>
Fisheries comes under the heading structural, internal and external, and seems to total about 1 billion euros. Much has been made of not renewing the 192 million euro renting of Morocco fishing waters, but quite a few other fishing waters are still being rented. I do not have the exact figure, but about 270 million euros are being paid to rent waters for mainly Spanish fleets to fish in. Under "internal" there is another 200 million euros for restructuring and decommissioning the Spanish fishing fleet. I am pleased that there is a requirement that 40 per cent. be for decommissioning; the Spanish hoped that they would get the whole lot for new vessels and restructuring.<br><br>
Structural expenditure comprising about a third of the budget has been the most useful aspect of EU expenditure. Looking forward, the big issue is that if the 10 new states accede, given the purpose of structural spending, which is on areas that are relatively poor, have high unemployment and need to be brought up economically, in terms of rankings, structural spending will have virtually to disappear in most of the more advanced economies. About 50 new regions would qualify under enlargement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As promised, the hon. Gentleman returned to the issue of fisheries, but he did not answer my question. Is it still Conservative policy to abolish the common fisheries policy?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that such an amiable Member of Parliament should be wasting the Committee's time. We have just had a general election, which the Conservative party lost rather substantially. Not surprisingly, all policies are up for review, grabs and homework. The view of most Conservative Members, and many Labour Members, too, is that the fisheries policy as it stands is entirely unsatisfactory and against the interests of this country. I have commented on some of the areas that are in need of major reform and the fisheries policy is one of them.<br><br>
Internal spending is the great area of the A30 gravy train grants totalling some 6.5 billion euros, up 4 per cent. That covers a lot of propaganda items. Something called the Socrates programme finances schoolteachers to have holidays in various places to discuss certain subjects. It also finances the women's lobby. Some things that it does are of value, but the main criticism is that it doubles up in many areas what individual member states are doing themselves. It covers adaptation to the knowledge-based economy, the environment, food safety and research and development, which is the major item. There is waste, as each member state has Government initiatives in that area and the European Union often competes with them.<br><br>
There has been comment on the 4.3 billion euros of external spend and the fact that it is expected that expansion will continue below what has been budgeted for. As everyone knows, that largely reflects the shambles of the EU aid budget; as Chris Patten's investigations revealed, the programme is four or five years behind. There are large sums of money sitting in bank accounts and half the time no one knows what is happening to it. As the Secretary of State for International Development said, the EU should do less of it and do it better.<br><br>
As hon. Members have mentioned, administration is up 5 per cent., not 3.5 per cent., at just over 5 billion euros, given the additional people to whom reference has been made. That seems to include nearly 300 million euros on delegations. There are 54 embassies competing with the embassies of individual member states, and 40 additional posts have been created. I note that pension expenditure is up 11.1 per cent. Although there are legal commitments, making sure that everyone's pension is generously funded is not one of the Commission's priorities. There is an urgent need for efficient management in the Commission.<br><br>
The pre-accession budget is 3.8 billion euros, which still includes SAPARD and PHARE. It is not clear whether those programmes, especially SAPARD, will be activated this year. The real issue is: what will happen to the budget and the whole process of EU collective expenditure in the light of enlargement? As I said, Gunter Verheugen apparently now envisages a big bang by 2004. It is difficult to envisage how the EU will complete its negotiations with new members, given that there is much to implement by that time, despite another billion euros for the budget for institutional building in new member states.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The EU has yet to start its negotiations about how to change agricultural support and structural support among its members. Clearly, if it does not do so, agriculture spending will increase by 17 billion euros, while structural support, which will mainly need to go to new members, is likely to be unacceptable to existing members.<br><br>
One of the sadnesses is that, because the budget is only just over 1 per cent., and the net British contribution is only 3.5 billion or 4 billion euros, none of us is diligent enough in making the territory more efficient and cleaned-up. There is a tendency to say, "There is not much we can do about it." Much of it is driven by legislation, as has been described, and the efforts of UK Governments, whether Conservative or Labour, have been directed at encouraging efficiency. Neil Kinnock is virtually the only person who has tried to reform the Commission. Like the Greater London council of the 1980s, it is in need of a bomb under it, in order to get rid of mismanagement, waste and potential fraud, and to deal with the macro-territory of redesigning agricultural and structural support for a new and larger Europe of the future.<br><br>
We cannot oppose the motion, but merely note it. We approve of the efforts of the Government, Costa Neves and others in attempting to introduce more discipline. However, congratulations are not due yet— there is nowhere enough discipline and far too much waste.</span></p>
<p>5.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the statement by my hon. Friend the Minister, and the reassuring answers to our questions about the abatement. We are pleased that that seems to be continuing. There is no sign that our Government will ever cease to insist that it be paid. The preliminary draft budget has been reduced by £240 million after abatement adjustment for Britain. I am sure that I could make helpful suggestions to my hon. Friends in the Treasury about how that £240 million might be spent—perhaps on areas adjacent to Luton, North. Those are reassuring points.<br><br>
However, major changes associated with enlargement are on the horizon. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) said, the budget is still dominated by the largest single item— the CAP—which even now is just under half the total budget, which has perverse effects in its fiscal transfers. It means that countries such as Britain that are relatively low down the living standard list are net contributors and that Denmark, which is at the top of the list, is a substantial net recipient. That is clearly not sensible. If the budget were at all equitable, net transfers would be made to poorer nations and net contributions by richer nations. That could be done in a progressive form, as with progressive taxation, of which I strongly approve.<br><br>
There are problems, therefore, and when enlargement happens those problems may become unmanageable in political terms. Are we seriously suggesting that Poland, a poor agricultural country, should not participate in the CAP, when not far across the water, Denmark, one of the richest countries in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
European Union, will continue to be net recipients from the European budget? I do not mean to be unkind to Denmark—I am simply using that country as an example. Such a situation would be nonsense, and something fundamental must take place before we go further, even if it is merely a promise about tapering change.<br><br>
Radical reform is necessary. The word "reform" is frequently bandied about, is much abused and can cover a variety of sins—such as doing very little, for example. Sometimes it means tinkering at the edges and, sometimes, really radical change. I am wary of the word "reform" and want a really radical change for the CAP.<br><br>
A point that arose in the debate on the World Trade Organisation negotiations recently was that France had negotiated an opt-out in the final statement about protecting agricultural arrangements in the European Union. Apparently, France was gleeful about the matter. I am not being unkind about the French, who have always acted in that way. Good luck to them if they perceive that move to be in their interests, but it is certainly not in Britain's or the European Union's interests that we continue with a wholly inappropriate and misguided form of agricultural subsidy.<br><br>
We have a problem, which may become politically explosive when enlargement comes. Countries such as Poland will kick up a fuss if they cannot have a bit of the action that other countries are getting, especially given the fact that Poland is dominated by agriculture to a greater extent than other countries and is relatively poor.<br><br>
A way forward would be to discuss the abolition of the common agricultural policy as it stands. Germany is apparently considering that possibility. We should think in terms of abolition rather than reform, but something must be put in its place. We cannot simply say, "From now you are on your own, chaps and lasses," but countries will want to decide for themselves what elements of agriculture they should support and sustain. I have a suspicion that, if the CAP were abolished tomorrow, the effects for many countries that are most concerned would not be that great. They would continue to have to pay substantial sums towards financing agriculture, but their contributions to the European Union would not be greatly changed. Apart, perhaps, from Denmark and Ireland, no country benefits so substantially that it could not live with a tapering-out of the agricultural policy.<br><br>
Repatriation of agricultural subsidies would be a way forward. Each country has a different form and style of agriculture and a different number of people employed in it. Countries produce different things in different climates: some are wine producing, some produce unsmokable tobacco and so on. Each country could decide for itself to subsidise the forms of agriculture for which it thought necessary to provide that support.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Before we joined the CAP, we had a deficit financing arrangement and an annual price review for farming, which worked well. Negotiations were on a sensible level every year, with different products subsidised to different degrees. That was sensible, and I advocate it throughout the member states of the European Union as a replacement for the CAP.<br><br>
Tapering over a period of, say, five or seven years is my suggestion, but someone somewhere—perhaps Germany or Britain, or both together—must bite the bullet, abolish the CAP and put sensible proposals in its place. The deficit financing arrangement, operated at national level, would be the sensible way forward. After that, we could consider the redistributive effects of the rest of the budget. If poor countries did not get enough and rich countries got too much, we could adjust the budget so that it was fair and equitable for countries with differing standards of living.<br><br>
That measure would accommodate new member states when enlargement took place. Britain might continue its contributions because, in the enlarged EU, we would be one of the richer states rather than one of the poorer ones, as all the countries joining would be poorer than us. Therefore, we will probably continue to contribute more than other countries, but we could consider abatement and come to a more sensible arrangement—one more like a redistributive taxation system within the EU.<br><br>
I have grave doubts about whether such an arrangement would be politically feasible. Nevertheless, it would be a sensible and rational way forward, and would ensure that the EU was fair and seen to be fair by all its member states. It would mean that rich member states carried a big burden, and that there was a substantial fiscal transfer arrangement for the poorer states. The big question is whether the electorates of member states would wear that.<br><br>
We face dramatic and fundamental changes in the EU and its budget. At the moment, we are merely talking about details of corruption and little bits of administration designed to ensure that some countries impose better discipline on their spending. That is relatively small beer compared to what will happen on enlargement. We must seriously face the abolition of the CAP and put in place sensible arrangements to subsidise agriculture for the foreseeable future.<br><br>
I do not expect the Minister to give a categorical answer now, but I hope that some of the matters that I have raised on the future of the EU will be discussed and thought about seriously in that wonderful building across the road, the Treasury, where so much that influences all our lives takes place.<br><br>
There should be dramatic change in fisheries policy. Norway, which is not a member of the EU, has managed to conserve its fish stocks well and so has a thriving industry. It looks after its own. I do not suggest that we should all immediately go into our bunkers and look after our own, but countries are much more likely to sustain and conserve their own fish stocks than to worry about what happens off the coast of, say, Spain or Iceland. It would be a much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
better arrangement for fish stocks to be husbanded by the nation states themselves rather than collectively through the EU.<br><br>
I suspect that some fish in Norwegian waters swim into our waters, where we catch them. We might still have our fish and chips because Norway does such a good job of conserving its fish stocks that at least some fish are left in the North sea. We must seriously consider reforming the common fisheries policy. Again, I do not expect a definitive answer from the Minister now, but at least she has heard my views, which I hope have been helpful.</span></p>
<p>5.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Jane Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the arguments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, although not with his conclusions, by and large. It is a virtue of Committees like this that such opinions can be aired.<br><br>
The anti-fraud office was set up for the most laudable reason imaginable—to combat fraud. Having had the opportunity to visit the Commission and other EU institutions during the previous Parliament, I am well aware of the lack of transparency and lines of accountability in those institutions. Perhaps I lack skill in deconstructing the figures presented to the Committee in this large number of documents, but the anti-fraud office's budget of 10 million euros for entertainment expenses caught my eye. I could not find such a significant sum allocated for entertainment expenses in other parts of the institution.<br><br>
According to the limited explanation provided, anti-fraud office representatives are not permitted to buy lunch or pay for any other kind of entertainment for staff of the Commission or of other EU institutions. However, I am at a loss as to why it would be part of their duties to buy lunch for anyone at all. We should be seeking further scrutiny and transparency and that small aspect of the operation of the anti-fraud office sounded alarm bells for me. Transparency in the work of the anti-fraud office should be pursued so that it can achieve the aims for which it was established. However, it is not clear to me how we can pursue it.</span></p>
<p>5.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs on representing a vacuum with such verve. It is a shame that more of his Conservative colleagues were not in the Committee. No other Conservative Members are present. There was one, but I believe that he had a deadline to meet for <i>The Spectator.</i><br><br>
For the purposes of our debate, it is a pity that there is a period between the disappearance of the former Conservative policies and the arrival of the new ones. At this stage, we do not know whether—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that although the fisheries policy is subject to review, it may end up exactly the same as before.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I worked in business, we normally had a policy until we had another one. The Conservative party seems to go through a middle phase where it does not have a policy at all. That applies to many of the hon. Gentleman's criticisms. For example, he expressed scepticism about the Socrates programme, but I did not hear him say that he wanted to abolish it. I await correction on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was that some things in the Socrates programme were perfectly worthy but others were clearly a gravy train. The programme is in need of financial discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all wish the hon. Gentleman well in his struggle with the haze of Conservative policy.<br><br>
Let us turn to the real world. The proposals before us seem to be in line with the prognoses that the Committee has discussed in earlier years. We all welcome the prospect of a brake on the spending on the common agricultural policy—so trenchantly criticised by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. There is even the long-term prospect of a reversal of the trend. Rather than going into detail on the figures, I would like to follow my hon. Friend in putting down a marker for discussion of the figures as they evolve in the coming years. If—it is a big if—the trade talks result in a decision to reduce or even abolish agricultural subsidies in the long term, that will result in a dramatic change to the entire structure of the European Union budget.<br><br>
The current budget structure is, to some extent, an historical accident. The common agricultural policy was developed at a time when most of the founders of what was then the European Community expected that parallel policies for industry, the environment and other areas would be developed. That has not happened to the degree that was expected, so we have a lopsided construction. We have a huge appropriation for agricultural support, but relatively little for other areas.<br><br>
As the Economic Secretary said, Britain is a net contributor. We therefore tend to be sceptical about all forms of spending, because we assume that we will end up paying more than most. If European agricultural subsidies are reduced even more quickly and more substantially than hitherto anticipated, we shall have the opportunity to reduce the overall budget. We shall also be able to take a focused approach on joint environmental action and joint action to promote economic and technological change in Europe in a way that is difficult for countries to achieve on their own. The North sea provides a classic example: if we make great efforts to keep it clean but the other countries bordering it do not—or vice versa—a good deal of our effort will have gone to waste. I urge the Economic Secretary to keep in mind the need for sensible development in other areas to match the reduction in wasteful agricultural subsidies that we all seek.<br><br>
I welcome what the Economic Secretary said about the importance of using overseas aid for poverty reduction, compared with the more politically focused aid programmes. Nevertheless, as I have in each of the past three years, I express regret that we continue to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
reduce the aid given to southern Africa. As the Prime Minister said, although we gave aid when Afghanistan last had a major crisis, we all headed for the horizon as soon as it was over and left them to it. I am sorry to say that we are doing something similar in southern Africa. We were extremely pleased when the apartheid regime was replaced. We wished the people well and made a few trade concessions, but we have now disappeared over the horizon. I do not wish to be a doomsayer, but southern Africa is not yet so stable and so reliably poised that it can achieve long-term economic and democratic success. We should not be quite as relaxed about it as the figures would suggest.</span></p>
<p>4.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a very interesting debate, and both sides have made useful and thoughtful contributions. I found it informative, and it has provided me with room for thought.<br><br>
Before responding, I shall set out in a little more detail the negotiation position that we shall adopt later this week—I understand that it will be after midnight on Wednesday. The Council seeks to leave adequate margins below the ceilings of categories 1, 3, 4 and 5, to enable unforeseen or new spending to be proposed in-year without creating pressure on the financial perspective ceilings or requiring significant redeployment, which could disrupt Commission planning. The Commission's preliminary draft budget and the Council's draft budget both need margins, although the Council proposes higher margins than the Commission. The European Parliament's amendments tend to lead to smaller margins, requiring greater redeployment if new demands arise within a given year.<br><br>
The Government particularly welcome the greater margin in category 1 and the inclusion of significant appropriations in the veterinary fund to allow payments to member states affected by foot and mouth disease. I clarify my earlier remark that 800 million euros have been allocated to the UK within the draft budget over 2001–02 together. I have further good news on agriculture. The Commission has now prepared its autumn rectifying letter for agriculture, and further savings are possible. They would increase the margin in that category to 2 billion euros, yet leave the same sum for foot and mouth disease.<br><br>
The Council's wisdom in leaving large margins—particularly in category 4, for external actions—will allow us some latitude to meet the increased needs in Afghanistan and its neighbours, particularly following the events of 11 September. I shall press for more resources, in the draft budget, for humanitarian aid in Asia, to respond to the new demands in the region.<br><br>
I increasingly enjoy encountering the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in debate. He is refreshingly open and honest in his reproach and has today praised the outstanding efforts of, for example, Neil Kinnock, in trying to reform the Commission. Neil Kinnock is the first person to take on that task. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that there are costs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
involved in EU membership, but he did not so clearly explain the benefits. It is wrong to consider those aspects in isolation.<br><br>
The European single market of 370 million people is the biggest in the world. Participation in it is estimated to have increased output across Europe by 1.5 per cent. That fact alone would pay for our next contribution, even before taking into account the many other benefits. For example, UK exports to the single market were worth £97 billion last year. Trade with the rest of the EU supports up to 3.5 million British jobs and the single market brings inward investment to the United Kingdom. Last year, it created 50,000 jobs in the UK. I urge hon. Members to bear in mind both sides of the equation.<br><br>
Members on both sides of the Committee talked about the pressures of enlargement on the EU budget, especially on the common agricultural policy. The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of enlargement. We realise that it will bring pressure to bear on various parts of the EU budget, but I do not think that enlargement will be unable to go ahead without CAP reform. The Commission enlargement strategy paper, which was published last week, confirmed that enlargement involving 10 new states is affordable with respect to the financial framework ceilings agreed at Berlin. That does not mean that we should not reform the CAP; of course we should, and, as I have explained, we are at the vanguard of attempts to do that. However, negotiations about the CAP should not preclude us from allowing the accession of new member states from eastern Europe. That would be wrong and we should keep the two matters separate to some degree.<br><br>
I hope that we shall be able to use the opportunity of mid-term CAP reviews in 2002 for significant reforms, to redress the serious economic distortions that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North pointed out, occur as a result of the CAP. I hope also that we shall be able to stabilise expenditure at sustainable levels. The world trade talks will be another impetus for reform. We should grasp the nettle now and encourage our partners to do likewise.<br><br>
It would be wrong to say that we have not yet managed significant reform of the CAP. While we may dispute how far the process went, what happened at Berlin was the most significant reform of the CAP since its creation, and the UK was at the heart of the process. Significant price cuts for cereals, beef and dairy were achieved and further reviews were promised. Although the reform does not go far enough or take effect as fast as we should like, it is right to recognise that we have made significant progress. The reforms are worth about £70 a year for consumers—a real result for people in this country and others.<br><br>
The CAP reforms led to a shift from production subsidies towards income-related subsidies, an issue that is of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. That goes some way towards enhancing sustainable development of the environment and of the rural economy. It is an important part of our approach to the negotiations in Brussels, and we shall continue to press for it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A study by Deutsche Bank shows the figure for structural expenditure going up to about 67 billion euros, and a 16.6 billion euro increase in CAP expenditure. Surely the question is whether that would stay, given the 1.25 percent, limit resulting from Berlin, and whether, in practice, member states would be willing to finance an increase to that extent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ruth Kelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not, for a second, deny that there are pressures on the EU budget that need to be addressed. However, we should not halt the process of enlargement merely because we are bogged down in arguments about the long-term shape of the common agricultural policy. There are pressures from various sources, many of which the hon. Gentleman will recognise. No doubt, there will be similar pressure to look at the operation of structural funds, post-enlargement and in the longer term. We shall keep an open mind about how to deal with the future form of structural funds.<br><br>
Both the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North talked about the possible renationalisation of CAP budgets, which Germany proposes. I would not say that that is the position held by Germany; it is one of the arguments in the debate. The UK remains committed to reform and it is important to find ways of negotiating that will carry pro-reform CAP members with us. Although we intend to use every opportunity to progress the matter, it is important to be realistic about the prospects for reform.<br><br>
Fraud has been mentioned many times. I very much welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about Neil Kinnock's efforts in that area. The appointment of Mr. Kinnock as Vice-President with special responsibility for reform was one of Romano Prodi's first acts when he became President of the European Commission. The Commission has already produced a code of conduct for Commissioners and for Commission officials, published a charter for whistle blowers, established new, fairer, arrangements for appointments to senior posts and started a major modernisation of financial management procedures that will establish clear lines of responsibility for preventing fraud and waste.<br><br>
The Commission cannot be streamlined overnight; it is a large, bureaucratic institution and it will take time for reforms to be implemented. It is important that the process of reform should allow sufficient time for consultation and that, where new posts are created, the procedures allow for the right people to fill them. In due course, we shall see improvements in the allocation of budgets, a crackdown on fraud and irregularities and a much more streamlined process, with direct lines of accountability throughout the Commission. The Prime Minister called for a root-and-branch reform of the Commission. I hope that that is what we shall see.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs talked about transparency in the EU budget and said that fishing was mentioned in three separate places. Of course, the budget is not as clear as might be desirable. However, the move towards activity-based budgeting will enhance its transparency. We hope that that will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
be in place on a trial basis by 2003, so that people have time to get used to its operation before the final version is introduced. Of course, it will always be possible to find examples that strike one as slightly odd at first, or even second, sight.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned the system for allocating grants, which we should perhaps consider. However, those who use the European opera centre in Manchester are also beneficiaries of such grants, so we do benefit from them in certain circumstances.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's call for greater transparency was not made in support of Prodi's calls for a new EU tax. Transparency can mean many different things to different people. The UK remains committed to rejecting a Euro tax, and I have made it clear several times that we would not consider introducing one. Instead, we must maintain firm discipline over the overall budget to ensure that it is well allocated.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned the need for progressivity, and he may welcome the move in the EU's recent "own resources" decision towards a greater use of GNP as a basis for allocating expenditure, because it will introduce an additional element of progressivity.<br><br>
I cannot comment on OLAF's expenditure budget, although I noted the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East with interest. I am sure that there is a justification for that budget, although I wonder what it could be. Perhaps we should delve into the matter to find out what OLAF proposes to spend its budget on. My hon. Friend raises an interesting point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned some of the ways in which the EU's internal budget is allocated. The largest single category is spending on research, most of which flows from legislative decisions on multi-annual envelope spending. The Council ensures in its negotiations that such decisions are respected. At the July Budget Council, a margin of 110 million euros was established, which is higher than that in the agreed draft budget.<br><br>
I agree that reform is needed in relation to category 4 and external actions, particularly to ensure that EC aid is spent efficiently and allocated in the right areas. We have debated that at length, so I shall say no more about it. We have also commented on the use of category 5 spending and on EU administrative spending. I repeat that the UK is committed to making savings within that budget, and different Community institutions should pool resources, particularly on matters such as translation and the use of facilities. I hope that significant savings will be achieved from that source in the future.<br><br>
This has been an interesting debate. I hope that hon. Members agree that we should ensure that sufficient aid is available to meet our priorities, particularly in Afghanistan and the surrounding region. We should retain a margin as regards the common agricultural policy and category 1 so that we can claim for foot and

mouth disease. Overall, we should continue to press for a firm budget-disciplinarian approach and to engage other member states on that basis.</span></p>
