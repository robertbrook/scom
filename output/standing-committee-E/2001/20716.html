	<div class='legislation'>2003 Draft Preliminary Budget</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Ruth Kelly)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Benton, I am delighted to welcome you to the Chair, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the 2003 preliminary draft budget of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, the time between publication of the budget documents and the Budget Council is short and a few volumes are still not available. My explanatory memorandum was submitted under the provision for "official text not yet received", but in the expectation that most documents would be available in time for the debate. That is the case, and I hope that hon. Members have benefited from having, in particular, volume 0, the general introduction, and the three parts of volume 4, which contains the Commission's budget. I shall endeavour to answer questions concerning the budget as a whole or particular chapters or lines that hon. Members are interested in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a net contributor to the EU, the UK's approach to the budget is characterised by budget discipline. We seek to ensure that the financial perspective ceilings established in Berlin in 1999 for the period 2000–2006 are fully respected. In general, we seek to restrict growth in the budget as much as possible by securing a margin under the financial perspective ceilings, while working to ensure that spending in each category of the budget is efficient and accommodates UK priorities without breaching the ceilings or resorting to the so-called flexibility instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Total commitments appropriations in the 2003 preliminary draft budget amount to just over €100 billion, or £61 billion. Payment appropriations amount to €98 billion, or £60 billion. Those figures represent increases of just 1.4 per cent. and 2.7 per cent. above the adopted budget for 2002 and are almost unchanged from the corresponding figures in the 2002 preliminary draft budget. As a result, the 2003 preliminary draft budget in payment appropriations represents 1.03 per cent. of member states' gross national income, slightly down on the equivalent figure of 1.05 per cent. for the 2002 Budget. That is clearly a move in the right direction, but there is scope to do even better, in terms both of limiting expenditure and of setting realistic budgets that avoid large surpluses of unspent payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals involve the use of the flexibility instrument to allow spending above the financial perspective ceilings in two areas. First, in category 2—the structural funds—for assistance to certain fishing fleets that have suffered from the loss of an EU fishing agreement with Morocco, and secondly, in category 5 for administrative spending, in a year in which pre-enlargement costs will put severe pressure on the administrative budgets of all the institutions.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The UK will press for savings to be found to avoid the use of that instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enlargement has to be a key priority for the coming year. However, we do not agree that increasing the administrative category of the budget by more than the 3.5 per cent. allowed by the financial perspective ceiling is necessary to finance the building, interpretation and other costs associated with enlargement. Instead we want existing resources to be redeployed and co-operation between institutions to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee know, much of the annual budget is determined by legislation that sets multi-annual envelopes for spending in such areas as agriculture, structural funds, transport networks and external aid. In the latter field, established aid programmes, such as those for the Mediterranean region and eastern Europe, mean that there is only limited scope for reprioritisation in favour of poorer countries. Nevertheless, the UK is determined that an increasing share of the external actions budget should be spent in low-income countries. We will take every opportunity to ensure that the EU lives up to its development policy declaration of 2000, which puts poverty reduction as its top priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging that the preliminary draft budget proposes resources for the common foreign and security policy that will enable the EU to provide a police mission to replace the United Nations presence in Bosnia. It also provides for the implementation of the new research and development programme, a new public health programme and measures to promote employment incentives. Spending on renewable energy and transport are also given high priority. The Government fully support those programmes within the context of firm budget discipline. The Government will continue to press for improved efficiency in all areas of EU spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Council's First Reading on 19 July, we aim to establish a draft budget with figures lower than the Commission's proposals in many areas. That will leave room for the Parliament to bring forward its own proposals before the Council's Second Reading in November. We look forward to constructive negotiations between the Council and Parliament with a view to agreeing a budget within the financial perspective ceilings. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.30 for questions to the Minister. I ask Members to keep their questions brief. There will be ample opportunity, if they so wish, to ask two or three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Luff 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Worcestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Benton—or at least, I seek your guidance as to whether this is a point of order or a question to the Minister. I am concerned that we are not considering today volume 2, Parliament document, and volume 6, Court of Auditors document. The Committee should have been given an opportunity to scrutinise those two documents at this stage. I appreciate that that is not the Minister's fault, but I wonder what procedures she can recommend to ensure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
that Parliament has a chance to scrutinise those documents in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be appropriate for the Minister to give an explanation, and then I will give whatever guidance I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I pointed out, there is a balance to be struck between waiting for all the available information to be put in the public domain and allowing Members a full opportunity to scrutinise budget documents so that they receive the necessary scrutiny before I have to travel to Brussels on Thursday night to start the negotiations on the preliminary draft budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Volumes 2 and 6 have not yet been published by the Commission. Of course we continue to press for earlier delivery, and I take the hon. Gentleman's point that it would be valuable if Members were to have a better opportunity to scrutinise those documents. However, as I made plain, the core documents have been made available, and I hope that the Committee considers them sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman happy with that explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should also have mentioned volume 9, which is also missing. On a separate point of order, Mr. Benton, I am concerned that documents available to Members of Parliament who are not members of this Committee did not include the preliminary draft budget report from the European Scrutiny Committee. That has now been corrected, but when I went to the Vote Office as late as at lunchtime today, the document was still not available. That is a very helpful document on which I hope to base some of my later questions. I hope that on future occasions steps will be taken to ensure that the Scrutiny Committee report is with the documents in the Vote Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that has been noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins (Luton, North)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister again confirm that the Government intend to defend, for the foreseeable future, the UK rebate on the budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are totally committed to the UK rebate, which recognises the fact that we receive less than other member states, while contributing a significant amount to the budget. It is important to do everything we can to ensure that that rebate is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Scrutiny Committee report contains three issues on which the Government should be pressed, and I would like to ask the Minister about the first of them. The Committee says that we should
	<br><blockquote><p>"press the Government on the Commission's proposal to fund the spending on administration and restructuring fishing fleets which breaches the Financial Perspective Ceilings by use of the flexibility instrument."</p></blockquote>
What is the Government's position on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Commission has proposed using the flexibility instrument to increase spending in category 2 on structural operations, and there is clearly a need to help member states affected by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
recent collapse of the EU fishing agreement with Morocco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we think that category 2 supplies sufficient flexibility for the redeployment of resources within the category, and we will press both for good budget discipline and for re-prioritisation within that category. We would not like the flexibility instrument to be used in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that throughout British industry there is a strong suspicion—I put it no higher than that—that, via the EU budget and member states' domestic budgets, some of our competitor states provide soft subsidies to their businesses and industries that we do not provide to ours. Does she share that suspicion? If so, can she tell me what steps she will take to negotiate with our partners to put an end to the practice, or to bring it into the open so that we can all take part in it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. We certainly need a fair state aid regime that concentrates on tackling real market failure rather than on propping up, with covert or transparent subsidies, industries that are flagging or are seen by their national Governments as in need of state support. A level playing field is important. We are promoting a debate in Brussels about reducing overall state aid, yet targeting it more effectively with measures that do not subsidise some industries as opposed to others, but tackle market failure across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reiterate the salutation from right hon. and hon. Members at serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Treasury's estimate of the United Kingdom's gross and net contributions to the European Union in 2003? Why were those figures not included in the Chancellor's statement yesterday, given that they constitute an enormous opportunity cost for the United Kingdom, especially pensioners, whose living standards are steadily declining?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those figures, as far as it is possible to provide them, are in the public domain. The 2003 preliminary draft budget implies a UK gross contribution of £8,455 million after an abatement of £3,075 million. It is not possible to provide an accurate forecast at this stage of what our net contribution implied by the 2003 preliminary draft budget is likely to be, as that will depend on inherently uncertain future receipts. However, we publish trended forecasts of the UK's fiscal year net contributions, which are published in the Red Book and the pre-Budget report. The trended net contribution forecast for 2003–04 published in the latest document is £3.2 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask a similar question about trends in our net contribution. I support my hon. Friend's statement that it is in Britain's interests to keep budget spending down, but would it not also be in Britain's interests to see a substantial shift from agricultural spending to structural fund spending? Should we not promote that more strongly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It is in our interests to see a reform of the common agricultural policy, but he will recognise that we are in the vanguard of pushing for that reform. We want to see a move from production-based support to support for goods that the public really wants, and to the promotion and sustaining of our rural environment. We will continue to press for that, and I am pleased to say that the Commission suggests an interesting—and, given its point of view, relatively radical—package of reforms in the mid-term CAP review. I hope that we can persuade other countries to sign up to it and perhaps push the Commission even further down that line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was remiss of me not to welcome you to the Chair in my opening point of order, Mr. Benton. I apologise for that omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have expected my second question, which is on the European Parliament and the budget, an issue on which the European Scrutiny Committee may want to scrutinise the Government. The Committee points out that the provisional preliminary draft budget is below the financial perspective ceilings set, and that the European Parliament has a habit of wanting to allocate that in full. Will the Government encourage the Council to examine closely the European Parliament's bids for extra spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we engage in constructive negotiations with the European Parliament, recognising that it has its own priorities and that we should try to accommodate them while seeking to preserve maximum budget discipline. An aim of the preliminary negotiation of the draft budget will be to secure as large a margin as we can underneath the current ceilings to give us room to manoeuvre. Of course we shall continue to monitor the proposals of the European Parliament as closely as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to negotiate reform of the CAP successfully on Thursday night, she will be aware that it remains a priority for this country. We should bear in mind the way in which other states have used single issues, such as Spain's objections to the incorporation of Gibraltar airport into the single European sky, which held that project up for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister raise with her French counterparts the issue of France's disgraceful and illegal decision not to allow British beef to be imported into France? Perhaps she could tie that in to some reforms that the French Government might want to make, as they are obviously jeopardising the entire project. The problem is causing real pain to farmers throughout the United Kingdom, especially in Scotland, large parts of which were not affected by BSE in the first place. I am sure that my hon. Friend understands their anger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises the issue of British beef. As I am sure that he and other hon. Members are aware, we are going through a legal process. It is clear that the French are breaking European law, and it is a benefit of our membership of the European Union that we can take such matters
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
through the courts. The British Government continue to urge the French to change their policy on British beef and recognise the fact that our beef is among the safest in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I told my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), we also continue to press for radical CAP reform, which decouples direct payments from production support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter (North Dorset)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 23 of the Minister's explanatory memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>""The Community budget has significant financial and policy implications. Since the UK is a net contributor to the EC budget it is in the UK's interest to restrict growth in the budget".</p></blockquote>
We contribute €13.8 billion from a total budget of €100 billion. The size of that sum led me, when I was a member of the Scrutiny Committee, to suggest that the debate be held on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister about two matters related to the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the Government's key priority would be to press for reductions in the preliminary draft budget proposals. First, will she tell the Committee what discussions she has had with other member states about alliances that could be built in the Council of Ministers to achieve those reductions? Secondly, would she go along with the spirit of the Foreign Secretary's statements during the Adjournment debate on European affairs that if matters came to a vote, the vote should be public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to say that we have established constructive working relationships with other member states in the European Union—in great contrast to the situation under the Conservative Administration. We have secured a deal that preserves the rebate. If the hon. Gentleman cared to examine recent figures, he would see that after the abatement the United Kingdom gross contribution will be 14.21 per cent. compared with 23 per cent. for Germany, 17.31 per cent. for France and 14.22 per cent. for Italy. We have constructive working relationships and are not forced to vote on issues. We win our case by persuasion, and we have secured a good deal for Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to fish? Her memorandum refers to additional money for restructuring fishing fleets. I understand that Spain is a large beneficiary of European Union fishing expenditure, yet it has possibly the largest fishing fleet and has derived most benefit from the Community's open seas policy. Will my hon. Friend consider the justice of the distribution of expenditure on fishing by the European Union, given that British fishing has suffered substantially? We have a long coastline and a big fishing industry, which has suffered greatly from European fishing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly welcome the Commission's recent review of the common fisheries policy, which proposes a comprehensive reform package to tackle over-fishing and ensure that there are sustainable fisheries both in and beyond EU waters. The proposed reforms have a cost element, which has yet to be fully scrutinised and debated by member states. However, the overall package moves us in the right direction. My

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
hon. Friend is right to draw to my attention the predicament of fishermen in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow on from the pertinent question asked by the hon. Member for Luton, North. Given that the flexibility instrument is having to be deployed since spending on compensation for British fishermen has, needlessly, been made redundant by the failure of the CFP to conserve fish stocks, has the Minister studied the Norwegian and Icelandic examples? Those countries have no need for such moneys to be disbursed because they conserve their fish stocks effectively. Has the Treasury examined the relative financial merits of pulling out of the CFP and maintaining flexibility instruments at the expense of the British taxpayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's views on fishing are well known in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Caplin (Hove)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And on Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as my hon. Friend says, so are the hon. Gentleman's views on Europe; I know that he would like us to withdraw from the CFP and the European Union. Of course, I fundamentally disagree with him about the benefits of being part of a common approach and a single market, on which 3 million jobs depend, because we certainly benefit from the single market. For example, in financial services, we have seen a sharp fall in gas prices as a direct result of being part of the single market. I have spelled out the package proposed by the Commission. I believe that we should take these matters forward in collaboration with our European partners, and I shall continue to negotiate in the same vein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall interrupt my flow of questions because I want to continue on the issue of fishing. I am intrigued by the Minister's defence of the CFP, a policy that even a Commissioner would not defend, and certainly a policy that even the most enthusiastic European should accept has been a disaster for Britain's fishermen. How is it possible to develop a draft budget when that policy is up for grabs? The review must be completed by December 2002 or the policy falls. A wild array of possibilities are open to the Commissioner who puts together the budget, from no expenditure at all, if the CFP is not renewed, to significant new expenditure to cope with its restructuring. How can that be accommodated in the time scale for the budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already referred to the current review of the CFP, which is being led by the Commission. The current cost of the full package is €272 million, most of which could be funded by reprogramming existing structural commitments. We have not yet discussed the financial details, but I believe that the broad thrust of the package could be met by that fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another matter that has been debated in the Committee before is aid to the developing world. It is well established that aid delivered through the Department for International Development is much more efficient and better targeted than it is through the European Union. Does the Minister think that there is a case for shifting more aid development money from European Union budgets to national budgets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly share my hon. Friend's desire to make aid flows as responsive to the international situation as possible and ensure that they are administered as efficiently as possible. We are engaged in discussions about how to make the aid budget more efficient. Proposals are currently being developed, and we would like all member states to engage in the process of making its use as efficient as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to my earlier line of questioning about the important third point in the Scrutiny Committee report. This is the last budget prepared under the current convention before we change to activity-based budgeting. Will the Minister reassure the Committee about the usefulness of this new approach and say whether, as the Scrutiny Committee asks in its report, the Government have any particular goals or concerns regarding the ABB approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly asks about the introduction of activity-based budgeting. This is the last time that the draft budget will be negotiated on the basis of the traditional budgeting method. The activity-based budgeting method has many similarities with the UK's own budgeting method, because it will allocate more money against agreed objectives and performance measures, which will make the budget process much less subjective and help to ensure that the appropriate resources are devoted to political priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of activity-based budgeting will also allow further decentralisation of Commission decisions based on the broader reform principles of efficiency, accountability and transparency. There will be greater efficiency, as such budgeting can help to ensure that the minimum amount of resources is used for maximum impact. There will be more accountability because it will shift the focus from budget inputs and instead join the budgeting and reporting processes together. Transparency will increase because the new methods will provide a clearer and more relevant view of the EU funding needed to achieve each of the Community's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government strongly advocate activity-based budgeting because we think that overall it will provide a better link between EU spending and outcomes for EU citizens. We look forward to being able to debate these complex and interesting matters on a new basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will have noticed that expenditure on overseas aid and external actions constitutes about one tenth of the expenditure on agriculture. Does the Treasury think that the world financial system would be better served if there were no CAP? Is the Minister conscious of the deep frustration of primary producing countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and many others, whose products are artificially kept out of European markets and who find their products in competition with subsidised European agricultural produce on the world market? Would it not be infinitely better and economically sounder if there were an open market for agricultural produce in Europe? Would that not save money for the British

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
taxpayer and reduce the need for aid and compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, I think I may agree with the hon. Gentleman. The common agricultural policy must change. It was designed for an era in which, as a collection of member states, we had to tackle food shortages. That is no longer the case, and reform of the policy would provide us with the opportunity to seek greater market access for developing countries, which is especially relevant in the current context of the World Trade Organisation and the Doha development round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The top line on page 47 of the charmingly-entitled volume 0 shows a budget increase of 6.9 per cent. in pensions for the European Commission. That contrasts with a modest increase in salaries of 2.2 per cent. I am aware that an explanation is offered at the bottom of page 47, but is the Minister satisfied that the Commission has the situation under control, and will the factors mentioned in that footnote, including an increase in the seniority of staff who are retiring, which pushes up the pensions costs, continue or tail off? What is the long-term trend for that apparently worrying statistic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly points to the increase in pension costs. The reason is partly the net increase in the number of pensioners to whom the Commission has a commitment that it has to honour. I have already mentioned that we would like category 5, administrative expenditure, to be contained. The Commission is required to meet certain costs, such as salaries and pensions, but there is an allowance of 3.5 per cent. within the ceilings. The extra pressures that arise before enlargement could be accommodated within that extra amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on a separate issue, but one with which she will be familiar? On page 88 of volume 0, there is mention of €959 million in subsidies for tobacco production. We see that expenditure in that sector has become
	<br><blockquote><p>"relatively stable. Production eligible for premiums is subject to a strict quota system"</p></blockquote>
There is no hint that those sums will be reduced in future. Later in the same document, on pages 125 and 127, we find public health expenditure of €59.5 million in 2003, and on page 127 we can read about the community fund for research and information. Appropriations requested for 2003 amount to €40 million, of which €10 million is foreseen to improve public awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption. There seems to be a slight contradiction in the policies of the European Union. I know that the Minister has spoken about the matter in the past, but I should like to hear what she has to say about it today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The UK would like to see a progressive disengagement with the EU tobacco regime. Unfortunately, we have to be realistic; there is strong pressure in the EU to maintain it. Eight member states grow tobacco and it is an important crop in many disadvantaged areas of the EU. We work by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
co-operation and negotiation and will continue to press for the tobacco regime to be reviewed. I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that total appropriations for tobacco in the preliminary draft budget are €973 million, which is down €10 million from the 2002 budget. At least we are moving in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask one last question, which I also raised this time last year. The same phrase occurs in this year's memorandum. In paragraph 23 of the explanatory memorandum, under the heading "Policy Implications", the Minister writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The desire for rigour in the EC budget is shared by the majority of member states."</p></blockquote>
I am surprised that not all member states want rigour in the budget. Will my hon. Friend tell us which member states are not interested in having a rigorous budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend knows that there are net contributors and net gainers from the EU budget. Surprisingly enough, the net contributors tend to push for greater rigour and discipline in budget setting, while those that predominantly gain from structural receipts and agricultural payments—they tend to be the Mediterranean countries—are less concerned about the overall budget limits. On the whole, there is a fairly simple divide, with the odd member state—I think that Finland is one—going from one category to the other in different years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 15 of the explanatory memorandum states that the reserves in category 6,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which now comprise only the emergency aid reserve and the loan guarantee reserve, total £434 million".</p></blockquote>
I am not an accountant, but does that mean that the European Union has total reserves of €434 million, or is that sum the total net addition to the reserves of the European Union? If it is the latter, what are the total reserves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the figure that the hon. Gentleman cites is the total reserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall revert to the vexed question of the subsidy for tobacco growers, with which members of the Committee will have become exceedingly familiar over the years. As the United Kingdom supposedly espouses an ethical foreign policy, why cannot Her Majesty's Government, and particularly Her Majesty's Treasury, take a lead and withhold payment of that subsidy for morbidity in the European Union. Why should that area of policy be dealt with at Community level? If the producer countries wish to produce tobacco, let them subsidise it. Why should the British taxpayer have to do so? Could we not refuse to pay our subscription for that iniquitous expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the previous Government we attempted a policy of disengagement and non-co-operation with other member states. It did not get us very far, and I am not about to recommend pursuing that policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be returning to the Minister's provocative remarks in my speech. First, however, we are indebted to the European Scrutiny Committee for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
quoting Budget Commissioner Schreyer. In paragraph 2.10, it is reported that she said that the Commission had left
	<br><blockquote><p>"a sizeable precautionary margin so that it could tackle other possible financial risks. That's sound budgetary policy."</p></blockquote>
I agree. It is prudent to have a contingency plan; indeed, we have such a plan for our own accounting procedures. Does the Minister feel that the precautionary margin is of the right size to cope with the possible risks? It may be a difficult question, but can she identify what risks the Commissioner may have had in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and it is always prudent to allow a margin for foreseeable and unforeseeable events. Indeed, we continue to press for a greater margin in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I could identify potential risks, but that might indeed be a little foolhardy. The Seville Council proposed a package of measures to combat illegal immigration, manage external borders and speed up work on common asylum and immigration policies, with target dates being set for each programme initiative. The Commission has been asked to submit by October 2002 a report on the effectiveness of EU budget resources for the return of rejected asylum seekers, the management of external borders and asylum and migration projects in third countries. When the report has been produced—we look forward to that—we shall have to consider the deployment of resources in individual countries and whether we want to make some of the margin available for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to run dry, Mr. Benton, but I have a couple more questions. I think that I am right in saying that the European Commission cannot borrow; it cannot have a borrowing requirement or go into debt. That seems very healthy and sensible, but I would appreciate hearing the Minister's reassurance that any attempt to change that would be resisted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we try to allow a margin for unforeseeable events—and for foreseeable events, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. There is a budget for commitments as well as for payments. In the EU budget, we want realism, effectiveness and efficiency in management of the resources, and that is what we continue to push for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the net contribution that the United Kingdom makes to the European Union. The hon. Lady projected expenditure for 2003 of £3.3 billion. Does she think that good value for money for free trade, which is an objective of the WTO anyway? Why do other free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the Mercosur to some extent not require subscriptions similar to what we pay for the benefit of free trade? Is it not the truth that we are really subscribing to a union, a superstate that curtails our freedoms and infringes the liberties of the subject?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's views on European co-operation, the single market and anything to do with Europe are well known. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Government believe that there are significant benefits from membership of the EU. At the Seville Council it was agreed that we would work together to pursue a common asylum and immigration policy that managed external borders effectively. If we could achieve that, it would be a significant benefit derived from increased co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned trade. Since the formation of the European Union, the proportion of our trade with other EU member states has increased significantly, and about 3 million jobs depend on it. The single market continues to have an impact on all aspects of economic life. It increases competition, drives down prices and increases consumer choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask for a little elucidation about the driving down of prices. In the past when Her Majesty's Ministers have sought to assess the economic benefit to the United Kingdom of the CAP, which constitutes almost half the projected budget for 2003, they have estimated the additional cost to the average family of two adults and two children as £25 or £26 a week. That is due to the extra cost of food, and, of course, the additional burden of taxation that that entails. Will the Minister give us a comparative figure in today's terms, as the last estimates are two or three years old?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman points to the share of the CAP as a proportion of the total EU budget. He is correct to say that those figures are slightly out of date, although the peak has now passed and the cost of the CAP to the EU is falling, as was promised in the past. It is significantly down as a share of the total EU budget compared with a decade ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also pointed to the impact on prices throughout the European Community. A liberalised European Union telecoms market reduced the cost of a three-minute telephone call between the UK and Italy, for example, from £1.86 to 91p during the decade to 1999. That is the sort of tangible economic benefit that has flowed from membership of the single market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now return to the subject of the external actions and the aid budget of the European union. Will the Minister express concern about its focus? I am sure that she could. I am not talking only about the way in which it is spent, which has been correctly identified by members of the Committee already, but about whom it is spent on. Does she share my concern that too much of it goes to middle-income countries, and that there is not sufficient poverty focus in the budget? When she goes to the Council, will she take steps with her colleagues to ensure that a proper poverty focus is introduced for the money, however badly it is then spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. We are pushing for a greater poverty focus in the aid budget. As he no doubt is aware, many of the programmes are multi-annual and committed well in advance. Other member states argue for the need for additional funding to promote political stability in certain regions. That, too, is a good use of the budget, but we want to see more of a focus on poverty. For example, we especially welcome
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
the 12 per cent. increase in the Asia budget, which is consistent with the EU development policy of putting greater emphasis on poverty reduction, because two thirds of the world's poor live in Asia. We will continue to push strongly for that, both at this week's meeting and when the draft budget is finalised later in the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the Committee's proceedings on 19 November 2001, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) made a statement about the procedure for letting contracts in the EU, which he felt did not offer sufficient value for money because they are simply let rather than bid for in a competitive way. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is an unhealthy bias toward letting contracts, rather than allowing contracts to be negotiated to give value for money."— 	<i>[Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i> 19 November 2001; c. 12.]</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister share those concerns, and if so, what is being done about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly want to see much greater rationalisation of Community resources, which should be used in a cost-effective and accountable way. Reforms are being pushed through the Commission to achieve those ends, and we fully support the Commission in its important work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I probe further the line of questioning pursued by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire about the priorities of the aid budget? I have referred to the fact that aid for Mediterranean partner countries will increase by 5 per cent., whereas aid for Latin America will decrease by 5 per cent. Is the Minister aware of the virtual meltdown of the Argentine economy? Does she realise that the real in Brazil has gone down by 18 per cent. this year? Is she aware of the extreme difficulties faced by Paraguay and Uruguay and the fact that an International Monetary Fund loan has just been disbursed to Uruguay? Is she aware of the unrest in Peru and the deep political crisis that afflicts the Andean region? How can she come to the Committee and say that the aid priorities are right, that relatively rich countries on our doorstep in the Mare Nostrum should receive extra money whereas the poor of Latin America should be further impoverished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the current unstable situation in Latin America and to the fact that expenditure on that area in the preliminary draft budget has been reduced, as has expenditure on other areas since money has been reprioritised to help the world's poor. Member states decided that the aid budget should focus on alleviating poverty in the world's poorest nations, especially in Asia. That approach is correct, and we have been pressing for greater emphasis on poverty alleviation. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has been extremely active in setting up the global health fund, to which the EC is also contributing. Therefore I disagree with the hon. Gentleman that we should reprioritise our efforts. I accept his point, however, that we should support regions that are politically unstable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are no further questions, we shall proceed to debate the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum from HM Treasury dated 5 July 2002 relating to the Preliminary Draft General Budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2003; and supports the Government's efforts to maintain budget discipline in the Community.—	<i>[Ruth Kelly.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a useful exchange. I hope that the Minister found it enjoyable. We heard some important statements from her, especially on matters relating to aid. I do not want to return to matters raised during points of order and questions, but I am concerned that we were not able to consider Parliament's money during the exchange. Parliamentarians might have interesting views on the issue, and I look forward to returning to it. The proceedings are literally Pythonesque—not only are we without volumes 2, 6 and 9, but we are also without volume 3. I am sure that you will remember the sketch, Mr. Benton: "There is no volume 3". It leads directly to the Australian philosophers' song. The volumes that we have are deep and considerable. Had we had the Court of Auditors volume, we would probably have had double the documentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important occasion for the House of Commons, because it is one of our rare opportunities to consider a large slice of British public expenditure. I am new to this; it is the first time that I have had the privilege of speaking on such matters. I think it is the first speech that I have ever made on the European Union in my 10 years in the House, but I strongly suspect that veterans of these occasions will feel a certain familiarity as we go through the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked up the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made during the debate on 19 November. He was concerned about the need for major and significant reform of the way in which the European budget is managed and organised, about absenteeism, about increases in bureaucracy, about waste and fraud, about the CAP, about civic issues to do with the functioning of structural funds—all matters to which I want to return—and the list goes on and on. I suspect that I could have read out his speech today, inserting up-to-date statistics. Nevertheless, it is an important occasion. It is a shame that more of our colleagues are not present—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, perhaps it is a good sign, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for the helpful explanatory memorandum, which is technically what this debate is about, and express my support for a large part of it. We have discussed administrative expenses at some length and the document notes the expenditure on administration. The Scrutiny Committee noted that the proposed spending on administration totals €5.447 billion—up 5.2 per cent.—and that the Commission intends to use the flexibility instrument to fund it. The Commission says that that is to do with enlargement. That is a plausible argument, and I would not wish to say that it is wrong. However, I am sure that it is an argument that the Treasury would wish to test carefully as the budget process unfolds. It is always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
easy for bureaucracies to find excuses for increasing their costs and harder to find ways to drive them down. I hope that that 5.2 per cent. increase will, at the very least, be brought under control in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum sets out the Government's key priorities and I am glad to see that administrative spending is one of them. To be fair to the Minister, it makes it clear that the external actions budget needs a greater focus on low-income countries. I am glad that she reiterated that during questioning. However, the Government will face some important issues over the next couple of years, which will shape their consideration of both this and future budgets. I am glad that the share of expenditure is, modestly, predicted to be down 0.1 per cent. on the previous year. Can the Minister tell me whether differing rates of growth in the economies of the EU member countries will affect the calculation during the year? There is some uncertainty about growth rates. I think that the assumption is of an average growth for the period of 3.4 per cent. across the EU 15, although that could change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget is large—some €100 billion, of which just under half goes on agriculture. I share the concern of some hon. Members that not enough goes on structural funds, which are a potentially useful instrument within the EU—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The percentage—not the absolute sum; I am not calling for increases in public expenditure. I would not do that. There is only 9 per cent. on external actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are the second largest net contributor and so it is right that the British Government should be particularly careful in their scrutiny of the budget, although the Germans have a proportionally higher contribution than us. France, despite profiting considerably from the CAP, is also a modest net contributor at about €1.4 billion last year compared with our €3.8 billion. I hope that we can look to the French to be a little more co-operative over some of the issues of managing the European budget than they have been in the past. As the Minister said in her opening remarks, we cannot do an awful lot about the budget because it is preset by legislation and policy making that has been established by the House, the Commission and various European parliamentary bodies well before. However, we can express concern about how the money is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 2000 the European Court of Auditors refused to give a positive statement of assurance for the seventh year running. In layman's terms, that means that it simply refused to sign off the accounts. Estimates put the percentage of the budget lost through fraud, mismanagement and waste at somewhere between 5 and 8 per cent., although it is difficult to estimate those sums with any real accuracy. Furthermore, because of poor management and—this is often a feature of European spending programmes—unnecessary complexity, a further 14 per cent. of the budget was not spent at all. That resulted in some 20 per cent. of the European Commission's budget being mis-spent or not spent. If those figures are correct they are worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development aims to promote rural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
development in accession countries. It has a very large budget, but it is simply too complicated and only a tiny fraction of the millions of euros available was spent. I think that $1 billion were allocated and €60 million were spent. It would be good to see the Minister pressing the Council to remove unnecessary complexity and to ensure that the money that is agreed by the Governments, the Commission and the European Parliament is spent. There is no merit in under-spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Court of Auditors has commented on the programme. Its president, Jan Karlsson, said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"pre-accession funds might not be available until after accession",</p></blockquote>
which is a strange state of affairs to say the least. He also said that the current
	<br><blockquote><p>"system of structural funds is almost impossible to execute"</p></blockquote>
because
	<br><blockquote><p>"the schemes and programmes are of enormous complexity".</p></blockquote>
It is the same problem. Simplification of the structural funds should make it possible to do a much better job. When asked whether the new Commission had made things better he replied that there were a number of hopeful signs, but we cannot give a positive statement of assurance because they cannot be registered. Mr. John Wiggins, a British member of the European Court of Auditors, said that the situation remained "unchanged".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are facing a budget that, essentially, has many of the characteristics of previous budgets. There are more demands for money from the institutions in the run-up to enlargement. It is a new excuse for more money, staff and buildings. It worried me when I was Chairman of the Agriculture Committee that the impact of enlargement on the EU's budgets had not been properly taken into account by a number of the key players. British Governments, both Conservative and Labour, understood the implications and sought with varying degrees of effectiveness to push the case, but who will end up paying for enlargement? It will be an expensive process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking as someone who has had to come face to face with asylum policy, through the possible siting of a large asylum centre in my constituency, I am interested to see how the budget develops in relation to a common asylum and immigration policy. That is clearly an area of considerable importance and sensitivity. We can agree that there is a need for joint action, sometimes bilateral with France and sometimes multilateral. The Government have an important task in sorting out exactly how they handle that issue during the negotiations. I look forward to hearing what happens in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was a little provocative from time to time. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), who has sadly gone, has his views, and I would have hoped that the Financial Secretary would regard him as the grit in the oyster that makes the pearl, rather than simply trying to kick out the grit as she did in her answers. He made some important points, and I am glad to say that she was once moved to agree with him on trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
The Financial Secretary overplays her hand when she talks about the fact that the previous Government were isolated but the current Government are not. It is terribly easy to get one's way on budgetary issues if one gives way all the time. If one's objective is to give way, one always wins. When one gives away opt-outs from various treaty obligations, it is no wonder that people are pleased. It is not difficult to win new burdens, but it was very difficult for Baroness Thatcher to secure the budget rebates in the first place. That was hardly the mark of a Government who did not know how to make EU institutions work to their advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the total figure for the rebate during its operation is £29 billion, which may not mean a great deal to people out there. However, an awful lot of money for each man, woman and child in this country was won by a Government who, the Financial Secretary says, were out of touch and unable to influence the affairs of Europe. I am afraid that the evidence says that she is wrong. You will rule me out of order, Mr. Benton, if I stray down this path too far, but the single European market was a Conservative success story won in the teeth of much opposition. It was a Conservative achievement, pushed by a Conservative Commissioner with the support of a Conservative Government. The rebate and that policy initiative prove how effective we were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go too far down that route, because this has been a largely consensual sitting to scrutinise the budget's detail. However, it is sometimes worth remembering that the budgetary trade-offs that the Government have had to make to protect the rebate have not been negotiated terribly cleverly. I am particularly concerned that the CAP is still attracting such large sums of money. The reason for that is that in Berlin the Prime Minister set a target to keep the abatement and not worry about the CAP. Mr. Chirac set a different target to ensure that French farmers benefited from the CAP. They negotiated until 3 or 4 am, and several weeks later the European Commission was still trying to transcribe the tape recordings to work out exactly what had been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We lost the opportunity to reform the CAP at Berlin, and only modest changes were made. We gave in to Chirac, and the result is that the budget that we are discussing today still includes an unreformed common agricultural policy. I hope that the Minister will make strenuous attempts to influence her colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to reform the CAP and to ensure that the budget comes under control. It is not good enough that 47 per cent. of the budget will be spent on agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During questions, it was pointed out that we spend large sums of money on agriculture that will work directly against the interests of the developing world. I highlighted tobacco and health policy as contradictory, and having an external aid policy while dumping subsidised agricultural exports on world markets is another classic contradiction. The Minister would agree with that. It is not a new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
problem, and the Americans are making matters worse at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly spoke about poverty in India, which is the second cheapest producer of milk in the world, after New Zealand. We could transform the Indian rural economy, not by pouring large sums of EU or British aid into rural India but by enabling its farmers to sell that milk on world markets. The crucial market is the middle east, which has a big demand for skimmed milk powder, but the EU dumps large quantities of that powder on it. A lot of money, detailed somewhere in the voluminous pages of the budget, is going to subsidise skimmed milk powder exports while other money is going to India and other countries that could use such exports to make up for the way we distort the world market so monstrously. There are huge possibilities for significant simplification of the common agricultural policy, which would stand British consumers, farmers and taxpayers and developing nations in very good stead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak briefly on the common fisheries policy. As we explored briefly during questions, a major review is taking place. However, there is a danger that if it is not completed by the end of the year, pandemonium will be created in fisheries policy, so I hope that the Treasury is working closely with DEFRA to ensure that the negotiations are brought to a speedy conclusion. We hope so for the sake of the British fishing industry and for significant budgetary reasons. I am unclear how to take account of the implications of the review without its being completed. I hope that no foot dragging will take place: the target has to be December, when the CFP elapses. I hope that the Government will bring great pressure to bear in order to achieve that target. We do not want artificially stopped clocks in negotiating rooms while details are thrashed out and budgetary uncertainty lingers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fraud is another important issue. The sums of money that fall within EU budgets are disbursed by member states, so checking up on fraud is often surprisingly difficult. The European Scrutiny Committee's 12th report includes the findings of the European Court of Auditors report for the financial year 2000. The Committee argued that as the report contained 500 pages it was a difficult report to comment on—often a function of European documentation—but highlighted one important point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Court has included its Statement of Assurance that the financial statements of the European Communities are generally reliable except for certain matters … However, the Court's audit work on operational expenditure revealed once again an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amounts of the payments, or the reality or the eligibility of the underlying transactions, as well as weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures in the principal systems covering Agricultural Guarantee and Structural Measures expenditure. The Court states that, in general, the Commission needs to improve the definition of the objectives of Community programmes and then undertake effective evaluation of their achievement, in order to ensure sound and efficient use of the European Union's resources."</p></blockquote>
That is an exceptionally serious finding and I hope that the Minister will take with her to Brussels at the end of the week a strong weather eye on fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
John Wiggins, the British member of the Court, was quoted in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> in November last year as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission still doesn't take seriously enough the need to improve its accounts and accounting mechanisms … It has tried to tighten up the regulations, but loopholes remain."</p></blockquote>
The British Government should be extremely vigilant in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to talk other hon. Members out of time, but I want to return to aid. I am glad that it had priority during questions. I reiterate the importance of ensuring that the aid is disbursed effectively and to the right people. The International Development Committee said in a report of 8 November 2000:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst it is undoubtedly true that many middle-income countries do, indeed, have a considerable number of their populations living in poverty"—</p></blockquote>
I might add the Minister's point about political instability—
	<br><blockquote><p>"this does not justify the current situation where, for the year 2001 the Commission is proposing to spend €961 million on Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Countries, ¬1.3 billion in the Eastern Europe and the Balkans (excluding pre-accession expenditure which, in itself amounted to €3.3 billion)—largely middle-income countries—yet, has proposed only €691 million from the Category 4 Budget for Asia, Latin America and Southern Africa combined despite the fact that, as Clare Short told the Committee, a third of people living in absolute poverty are in India alone."</p></blockquote>
I want to put fire into the Minister's negotiating tactics: she should argue a very strong case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effectiveness is another important matter, as other hon. Members have ably proposed. I shall not reiterate the point, but it is a continuing concern of the entire international development community in the UK that the aid budget is not particularly well spent. I am aware that some attempts are made to counter fraud by asking many questions, but in a disaster and emergency it is probably better to make the payments and ask questions later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to produce valid figures, but I shall not bore the Committee with the reasons why. The Library informs me that the top 10 aid recipients of the EU for 1999—the most recent year for which I could get figures—were Poland, the Czech Republic, Morocco, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Egypt, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, unspecified ex-Yugoslavian states and Russia. We do not believe that there is one poor country in that list, which is of some concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not read all the documents, which may surprise members of the Committee. [HON. MEMBERS: "Shame!"] However, I leafed through them, and it just shows how important it is to look at some of the detail. The Committee is invited to participate in an extraordinary task today: to consider heaven knows how many documents in two and a half hours, excluding the ones that we do not have. There were some fascinating fluctuations in the figures. The Committee will be relieved to hear that I do not want the Minister to respond to each detailed point that I am going to make, as some of them are illustrative. However, if they strike a chord with her, I am happy to hear her comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 333, volume 4, book 1, we read about the sheepmeat and goatmeat regime, which is very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
interesting. The intervention in the form of storage has increased from €34,736 to €5 million. I wonder why. The ewe and goat premium payments are all over the place, for which there may be a good reason. They decreased from some €1 billion in 2001 to €0.5 billion in 2002, and they will increase to €1.5 billion in 2003. Huge sums are sloshing around, which suggests that a detailed scrutiny of all the documents would keep many people happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pages 115 to 117 detail expenditure resulting from special functions carried out by the institution. Article A-3021 details grants to European think tanks and organisations advancing the idea of Europe. Some €2 million will go to them in 2003, down from €2.2 million in 2002. I would like to know more about how that money is spent. The Committee will be sorry to hear that Journalists in Europe, which received €250,000 in 2001 and 2002, will receive nothing in 2003. All sorts of interesting nuggets are buried away here that could form the basis of speeches in their own right. There is one worthwhile line of expenditure: the preservation of Nazi concentration camp sites as historical memorials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 117, expenditure on town-twinning schemes has decreased very sharply, which surprises me, as many people rather enjoy that aspect of the EU. The figure has decreased from the €12 million appropriation for the current year to €7 million next year. That reduction—€5 million in a year—is huge. There may be a perfectly innocent explanation for that, but I would like to know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 363 of volume 4, book 2 details expenditure on measures to combat instances of discrimination, exclusion and mistreatment, and grants to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. One cannot comment on such an organisation unless one knows something about it. I must admit that I do not, although it may be important, useful and a very good thing, as we have concerns about the growth of right-wing extremism in Europe. Against that background, I wonder why the payments made to the centre in 2001 stood at €4.8 million, but they will be €2.6 million in 2003. One would think in the current environment that expenditure to a useful organisation doing a good job of work would increase, or does the EU think that it is no good at all? Has the EU cut its money, despite the rise in extremism on the mainland of Europe?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 319 appears to carry another nugget. That is the general problem with these documents. I must admit that I am a novice in this area, and I do not know what "PM" means, although it appears frequently. Is it Prime Minister? Who knows? It signifies a blank—it means that there is nothing there, for whatever reason. I may be enlightened as to the meaning before too long, but we can get the general flavour of what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 290, under "Industry", the layout of the research programme of the European Research Fund for Coal and Steel is particularly jolly. It has many columns and tables, which are all blank except for eight occurrences of "PM". It does not help the Committee or the House, when trying to scrutinise a budget, to be confronted with a blank piece of paper
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
with a mysterious acronym or abbreviation lurking on its pages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the matter of page 199 with trepidation, but it tells us that there is a significant increase in funding of European political parties. I speak as someone who strongly supports the European Union, and I resent the Prime Minister's jibe that all people of sense have been driven from my party. It upsets me when he says that. At any rate, it is worrying that the rising funding is based
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the need for transparency"—</p></blockquote>
whatever that means—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the necessary reinforcement of the democratic accountability of the European Union",</p></blockquote>
and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is intended to finance, at European level, political parties which contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the European Union."</p></blockquote>
What a splendid phrase that is! However, I wonder whether we are right to put the budget up by more than 10 per cent. when we are trying to make administrative savings in the European Commission budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a presentational point, pages 105 to 133 of volume 4, book 3 could be extremely useful to the Committee. Aside from the regular occurrence of "PM", there is a helpful table giving the percentage change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I am about to be enlightened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should explain to the hon. Gentleman that "PM" means "pour memoire". It is a device inserted in the documents to keep the budget line alive even when there is no specific amount to be entered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am so glad that I asked that question, as it has changed my understanding of the documents. I am deeply grateful to the Minister. It is always as well to ask the damn-fool questions in this life, because one often gets the most interesting answers. I have learned that one should not be afraid to ask questions that make one look stupid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information is useful indeed, because I now know that nothing is being spent in refunds on barley, grain, malt, durum wheat flower, groats or meal. No money on groats this year—what a great sadness. However, it would be helpful if columns 9 and 10 showed the percentage increase so that we could read those useful indicative figures, which would be more valuable if they were in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise another interesting point. When one sees a sharp increase in expenditure, one has to be a little careful. On page 145, volume 4, book 3, the European Aviation Safety Agency is mentioned. I imagine or guess that that is a post-11 September reaction. This year, the commitment appropriation is €1,750,000 and the non-compulsory expenditure payment appropriation is €1,400,000. In the coming year, the budget will go up to €9,240,000 for the commitment appropriation and €7,350,000 on expenditure. By any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
standards, that is a huge increase. I suspect that there is an explanation, but I did not ask the Minister about it during questions because I thought that she might need a little time to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on fleshing out such examples, which highlight the importance of examining the detail of the budget documents. My hard work on the remaining three volumes will go undiscussed by the Committee in the interest of making progress. I am grateful to the Minister for her answers and wish her success at the European Council. Many of her expressed objectives in the memorandum are shared across the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths (Reading, East)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the transport safety actions on page 35 of volume 0, which show a large increase in the allocation for transport safety—€53.2 million, or 83.3 per cent. That is to be welcomed, but it seems that the proposal for the new Marco Polo programme, which is intended to move freight from road to other transport modes, has not been considered in conjunction with the particular difficulty between the UK and France and the great difficulties experienced in transporting freight that goes to and from the UK via the channel tunnel, despite recent initiatives at Sangatte. I wonder about the efficacy of the Marco Polo programme, if that other situation is not addressed in the coming 12 months. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. It is also, once again, a great pleasure to debate these matters with my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. We have discussed them many times before and I hope that she will forgive me if she has heard before some of what I say today. I may repeat some points, but they are nevertheless important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can make light of the fact that we have such vast documents in front of us and I must confess that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire has read rather more of them than I have. However, I have browsed through the key documents and the explanatory memorandum, and I have examined a number of the statistics, which are particularly significant. The financial perspective statistics and diagrams on page 55 of volume 0 show, rather disturbingly, that there will not be much change in the ratio between spending on agriculture and spending on other areas in the European Union, probably over the next six years and certainly over the next four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one examines the columns carefully, one finds that there is a slight increase in the ratio of agricultural to structural spending, which suggests that we are not making much progress. Time and again we are told that there will be fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy, but in reality we tiptoe round the edges in case we cause too many difficulties with other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must face up to the fundamental reform of the CAP at some point. I would even go so far as to suggest abolition and replacement by another system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
of agricultural subsidy. If only we could persuade one or two other member states that that would be, in the long term, beneficial to them as well, we would certainly reduce some tensions in the European Union. If we want the EU to succeed, it is important to ensure that we remove areas that cause stress and tension. The CAP does so constantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As and when enlargement is finalised, we must face up to the reality that the CAP is outmoded, if it ever worked at all, and should be abandoned and replaced by something more sensible. I suggest that we might replace it with a system of deficit funding rather than price maintenance. There has been a shift in that direction during recent years, and we should not accept the price maintenance approach, which creates surpluses that are then dumped in other markets to the detriment of poorer countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister—I do not expect her to respond in detail now, but it is worth the European Union's time and certainly that of the Government—to investigate the possible distributional effects among member states of abolition of the CAP. I suspect that they would not be as serious as they might have been some time ago. When the Common Market was formed, France was a major beneficiary and other countries benefited, but that is changing and I suspect that the distributional changes would not be as great as they would have been then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abolition might be to everyone's advantage and make Europe and the European Union more popular in the world generally, because we would be able to look other people in the eye and say, "We don't indulge in too much subsidy, so why should you?" America is heavily subsidising agriculture, but we cannot complain because we do the same. That is to the disbenefit of Britain as part of the EU. More importantly, however, it is to the disbenefit of those poorer nations that are primary producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary tells us one day what might be the distribution effects of complete abolition. I would also like her to explore the possibility of other forms of agricultural subsidy— perhaps a repatriated subsidy arrangement—that could allow a return to a more sensible arrangement that enables us to target subsidies more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have a deficit funding system rather than price maintenance and we would not produce surpluses—our farming community would probably be happy with a Government who did that. It would certainly be beneficial in terms of our budget contribution. I ask my hon. Friend to look seriously at fundamental reform and possible abolition, and perhaps to come back one day and explain the possibilities and how they might affect us and other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that I raised during question time is the fact that the common fisheries policy is causing serious friction between member states. I would not say that we have fished out the seas around Britain, but we have substantially depleted fishing stocks, particularly in the North sea. We cannot deny that the CFP has been the real cause. If the more extensive national fishing limits had been maintained, I suspect
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
that member states would have looked after their own fish stocks more effectively than the EU has under the CFP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the country with the best fishing stocks in western Europe is Norway, which is not a party to the CFP. Norway looks after its stocks because fishing is fundamental to its economy. The industry may not be so important to us, but it is still significant. We have lost out because of the freefall in fishing caused by the unsuccessful attempt to impose quotas and so on. I ask my hon. Friend to consider what might happen if we could substantially extend national fishing limits. Some might say that we would be abandoning the CFP, but I would say that it was fundamental reform—let us use a code word again. However, extending national limits again so that those nation states to which fishing is important can defend their own would be to the benefit of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, together, we looked after our fishing stocks, we could sustain our fishing fleets and fishing industries and look forward to a better future for everyone, with more fish in the seas surrounding the EU. That is fundamental. I do not want to point the finger and say that other countries are stealing all our fish, but it would benefit the whole EU if we went for fundamental CFP reform, or even its abolition, with a substantial extension of national fishing limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that occurs to me is that although we are sensibly not in the single European currency, our currency fluctuates against the euro and it is currently falling. Sterling has been substantially overvalued for some time, and settling down against the euro will affect our net contribution, because we are net contributors. It will cost us more if our contribution is denoted in euros, but if it is denoted in sterling we shall benefit when the euro moves in our direction in a substantial devaluation or depreciation of sterling against the euro. Indeed, some time ago the Treasury leaked the idea that a depreciation of 20 or 30 per cent. might, in the end, be sensible. That could have a significant effect on our net contributions and we ought to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of my concerns is regional inequality in Britain and in the European Union. One of the problems with the EU is that there is no provision for sufficient fiscal transfers to enable the living standards and the economies of different parts of Europe and different regions to converge. We have a serious problem in Britain and, so far, EU regional structural policies have been insufficiently beneficial to make a difference to our regional inequalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, the Trades Union Congress published a document on regional policy, urging the Chancellor, in his spending review, to invest a lot more in regional policy. In a past life, I was responsible for TUC regional policy and I demonstrated that regional policy can reduce differences in living standards and economic activity between British regions. We must move further in that direction because, as the TUC has reminded us, Britain has the widest regional divergences of any country in the developed world apart from Mexico, which is relatively much poorer than us. Nevertheless, it was a surprise to find that the inequality is so great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Relying on European Union structural funds to overcome the problem will not solve it. Relying simply on market forces and on people getting on their bikes to look for work, as a certain Conservative politician suggested, will not work either. We need substantial regional funding increases, and I suggest that they should be nationally based and much increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot rely solely on the European Union budget, even if there is a substantial shift from agricultural to structural fund spending. We sometimes make light of these debates, which are very enjoyable, but we are discussing serious matters. The lives of people in the north of England are much worse than those of people in the leafy counties of the south-east. I am a south-east MP, so I am aware that some parts of our region are relatively prosperous. We have to address that by considering national regional policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) mentioned investment in transport infrastructure. The trans-European network initiative is important for Britain. We are peripheral to the core of the EU, and it is vital that we have good transport links if our economy is to compete effectively in a single market. We must have more investment in infrastructure, and it would be helpful if Europe addressed that need, particularly in our case. I support the central railway, which will be a dedicated freight line from Liverpool to Lille, via the channel tunnel. I have spoken about that in the House several times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that information, and I am aware of the alternative use. Although we are digressing from the EU budget, freight could be taken off the east coast and west coast main lines, freeing them up for passengers, as is done in France. Last year, I looked at the French railways, which have segregated passengers and freight. That is one initiative on the continent of Europe, which has a more sensible approach to railways than we do. We could learn a lot from how such railways—publicly owned state systems, for example—are run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU could address that issue to good effect, with particular benefit to peripheral economies such that in the north of Britain. I do not expect definitive answers from my hon. Friend, but I hope that she takes what I have said into account in future European Councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Worcestershire. I congratulate him on his first outing in a European debate and I reassure him that should he wish to pursue these matters further, volumes 6 and 9 will be published by the Commission during the next two weeks and volume 2 will follow, so there will be an opportunity for him to peruse those if he so wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will try to deal with some of the points raised— briefly, important though they are. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire points to category 5 and the use of the flexibility instrument in dealing with the administrative pressures, pre-enlargement. In the negotiations, the UK will stress that the administrative budgets of Community institutions should be subject to the same budget discipline as the national budgets of member states. That should be the general approach. We want the growth to be restricted and we believe that the 3.5 per cent. allowed within the financial perspective ceilings is sufficient to absorb the extra pressures. At the Council on Friday we will be pressing for the budget to be reduced and for the use of the flexibility instrument to be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman points to the uncertain impact of growth rates on the share of GNP and the budget share accounted for by various member states. The share will vary with the growth rate, but the figures and the proposed budget are based on the percentage of member states' forecast gross national product. Clearly the outcome will be influenced by the actual growth rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman points to the fact that there is a surplus in the 2001 budget of nearly €15 billion. Such a surplus is unwelcome, particularly as this is the second successive year when a large surplus has occurred. It is difficult to say with precision, in advance, how much will be spent in a particular year, although we continue to press for further reform and more realism in the assessing of budgets so that they reflect what is likely to be spent rather than overbudgeting, as has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also points to the issue of fraud at the EU level. We believe that any level of fraud associated with the EC budget is unacceptable and will continue to work with the Commission and other member states to fight it. We take financial management reform extremely seriously and are working with the Commission and other member states to make improvements such as the introduction of clearer and simpler regulations to reduce errors, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest report on the fight against fraud, which was published on 3 July, shows that the level of reported irregularities in most sectors has fallen. That is encouraging, although we cannot be complacent and cannot read too much into one year's figures. Last year's high figures, for example, included amounts for a small number of long-running court cases, so it is not surprising that this year's figures are somewhat lower. We continue to monitor such incidents, but we should take care not to confuse financial irregularity with fraud, as there can be genuine administrative errors, which are classified under the same heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks who is likely to pay for enlargement. I have some good news on that front,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
because when the Berlin financial perspective ceilings were set, it was assumed that there would be six member states joining the European Union. It is now more likely that 10 new member states will join, but that they will still be able to do so under the existing ceilings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, it is something of a success story that we have been able to accommodate those new entrants in the original budget. The proposals are still under negotiation, but we are determined to secure affordable enlargement under the Berlin ceilings. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, pre-accession funds are not to be spent until after enlargement. The reason is that uptake has been slow, in part because it has taken time for SAPARD agencies to be accredited. However, apart from two, all are now accredited, and we expect payments to pick up in due course. We are certainly determined to see pre-accession funds going to candidates before they join, to enable restructuring to go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Valuable points have been made about the common agricultural policy, and I am well aware of the interest of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North in such matters. We made valuable progress at Berlin in reforming the common agricultural policy, as well as on price cuts, major commodities and the introduction of support for rural development and the environment, but I agree that reform needs to be faster and deeper. That is our aim in this year's mid-term review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly agree that a review is necessary to benefit taxpayers and consumers not only in nation states but in developing countries. We want to remove the link between subsidies and production, to shift support so that we pay for public and environmental goods and to allow greater market access for other countries. Therefore we welcome the Commission's proposals, because they form an excellent basis for discussion. The points raised by my hon. Friend about the distributional impact of getting rid of the CAP are interesting. I do not share his optimism that we can reach that point so quickly, but we want to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire spoke about the aid budget. I am pleased that he supports the Government in trying achieve greater focus on poverty. We certainly welcome the 12 per cent. increase in the Asia budget line. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fact that appropriations for the western Balkans and Latin America are down by 11 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively, while proposed spending on Mediterranean partner countries, including pre-accession aid to Turkey, Malta and Cyprus, has increased by 5 per cent. On balance, the provisional budget slightly increases the focus on poverty, and we are determined to continue pushing in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised several detailed points, which I shall deal with extremely briefly. On sheepmeat and goatmeat, last year's reform of the sheepmeat regime led to a one-off budgetary saving in 2002, which is why there seems to be a large increase in 2003. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I see that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
On political parties, we now have a commitment to show support for European political parties transparently. We welcome that. The inclusion of political parties as a separate item reflects Parliament's agreement that such support should be shown directly in the budget lines. In previous years it was tied up with other elements of the European Parliament budget, so we welcome that improvement in transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to correct the hon. Gentleman's impression in relation to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Commitment appropriations have increased to €3.2 million in 2003 from €3.1 million in 2002. I believe that the hon. Gentleman referred to payment appropriations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luff</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said 2001.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman corrects me, but anyway, the appropriations will increase in 2003.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the increase in the commitment for the European Aviation Safety Agency for 2003. Commitments for 2002 set up the agency, so the increase reflects the increase in operational cost requirements. That will provide an audit function for airport safety and harmonisation of air safety standards, which I am sure the Committee will agree is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East rightly referred to the importance of the Marco Polo programme, and made a valuable contribution. The issue is being considered in greater depth in a Council working group, which will make proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a lot of interest in fisheries and other such issues. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North that we need to ensure that stocks are not further depleted, and also to ensure that policy is based on the best science available. We support reforms that tackle overfishing, and I agree with him that we need to provide a sustainable future for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure members of the Committee that in the course of the Council's budget discussions on Friday, and before we establish the draft budget, we will be joined as usual by the Parliament's Committee on Budgets. It will point out to us its priorities for the budget, which we will monitor extremely carefully. Then the Parliament will hold its First Reading in October, when on past form it can be expected to bring its own proposals for spending, which are not included in the Council's draft budget. That is one reason why we need to maintain margins in the draft budget. In any event, we will continue to scrutinise proposals for additional expenditure carefully and to argue for any reduction in the margins to be focused on Government priorities, including further improvement in the poverty focus and external spending, on which we hope that the Parliament will share objectives similar to those of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also hope that the Council will succeed in further increasing the proposed margin for traditional CAP support. The Commission's proposals for an increase of just 0.9 per cent. in 2002 already involve a slight cut in real terms. We want the Council to go

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
further, while ensuing that the Commission nevertheless has sufficient funds to meet the UK's claims in respect of foot and mouth disease. We shall also press for increased margins below the Berlin ceiling in other categories, and for realism in matching the level of commitments and payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to a successful ECOFIN on Friday, and I thank the Committee for generally endorsing the Government's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
