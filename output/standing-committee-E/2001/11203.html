European Arrest Warrants and Surrender Procedures between Member States</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>[Relevant Documents: Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Reports of the European Scrutiny Committee, HC (2001–2002) 152-vi, vii and viii.]</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see that you are the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Griffiths.<br><br>
The European Scrutiny Committee has taken great care over the detail of the framework decision, and I am sure that I will receive further probing questions from this Committee this afternoon. I shall answer members of the Committee as fully as I can, but I do not think that I shall satisfy them on each point that they make. A framework decision means exactly that. We shall need to work out precisely how we will apply it to legislation in practice. It is our intention to do so in this Session, when we introduce new legislation to reform our extradition arrangements not only with the European Union but across the board.<br><br>
The framework decision deals with extradition within the European Union. It is right that we should approach our European neighbours, all of which have incorporated the European convention on human rights, on the basis of mutual trust. We should not assume that our criminal justice system is infinitely superior to that of other countries. We badly need a swift, fair system. That is the right route. We do not believe that criminal law should be made the same throughout the European Union, but we do not believe, either, that we can continue with the detailed legal regulations that clog up our extradition process. Much has been made of claims that the offences on the list do have not always have precise counterparts in our law, but, with respect, I must point out that such claims miss the point.<br><br>
Just as we would expect to frame charges within our national law, we are accepting for the first time that our European partners should be able to frame their charges according to their national law—the law in the country in which someone will be tried—and we would not try to double-guess each detail of such issues. Extradition proceedings are not a mini-trial, and when the trial is to be held in Europe, we should not be looking under every stone to find out how it may allegedly be inadequate.<br><br>
I deal with individual cases, so I know that at present—10 years after the United Kingdom ratified the European convention on extradition—the Bow street magistrate is still carefully checking antiquated authentication procedures and hearing arguments about whether some of the charges should be dropped, because they do not correspond precisely to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
offences under our law. Some cases take years to complete, and trials are delayed, to the frustration of many, including the victims.<br><br>
Although the commitment to the basis of such a step change was made soon after 11 September—it will be agreed upon when the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers meet on Thursday and Friday later this week—much of the preparatory work was done before then. The European arrest warrant is not new. It is a logical step. We accept extradition requests from prosecuting authorities and magistrates in Europe now. Why should we be concerned to check the source of those requests? We do not expect our European partners to query whether our judges are qualified to issue the warrants that form the basis of our extradition requests, so why should we seek to do that in reverse?<br><br>
We are maintaining core principles: the warrant is to be issued by a judicial authority. It can apply only within the Union and will be executed by a district judge here. As is right, there are tightly defined grounds for refusal, and there will be an appeal against that decision. However, the primary safeguard for the individual is that he or she will be returned to a country that has domestic incorporation of the European convention on human rights in its national law.<br><br>
If you will allow me, Mr. Griffiths, I must make a correction to a written submission that I gave the European Scrutiny Committee a week or so ago. On 21 November, the Committee asked which system of law would be used to determine whether an act relates to any of the matters in article 2(4), which are:
<br><blockquote><p>"abortion, euthanasia, morality, sexuality, or freedom of expression and association."</p></blockquote>
On 27 November, I answered:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dual criminality would apply, and we expect consideration to be similar to that at present under section 2(2) of the Extradition Act 1989."</p></blockquote>
I should have said that dual criminality could apply to requests relating to offences under article 2(4). Obviously, we must finalise that in our legislation. A framework decision gives us the option of whether to apply the dual criminality test or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have until half-past 5 to ask the Minister questions. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. I think that hon. Members will have ample opportunity to ask several questions, provided that we keep to the "short and concise" rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jane Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'> (Reading, East): I have a question for you, Mr. Griffiths, and I hope that you can offer guidance to myself and others.<br><br>
I did not receive the papers for this Committee last week, as I had expected to. My office had to do a lot of work to chase up and eventually locate them. They did not reach me personally until Friday, which I suggest is too near the date of the Committee to allow ample time for reading—although fortunately, there was not an enormous number of papers to read for this sitting, compared with other sittings. How can we ensure that hon. Members receive papers in sufficient time?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take note of that point. No doubt the Clerks and Home Office officials will have heard it, too. The papers were a bit late this time, but I am sure that that will not happen again—at least, I hope not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have millions of questions to ask, so I hope that that will be a consolation for the Minister.<br><br>
Will the Minister set out the current state of play about derogations from and reservations under the convention by other European Union states? I ask only because, obviously, the position can change all the time. Some of the assurances that people will want are linked to the fact that all the states about which we are concerned are signatories to the European convention on human rights. It would help to know which states have derogations from or reservations under the convention—in addition to that implemented by the United Kingdom the other day—and to which articles such derogations or reservations apply. That might affect our views on whether safeguards are adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is discussing a matter wider than the European arrest warrant. Obviously, we continue to discuss the situation and there are further documents in which there are changes. As there are not substantive issues moving in a direction that would worry the Committee, I was hoping that, in order to keep it simple—and believing that we could address all the issues of principle—we would apply ourselves to the latest English text available to me and the Committee. I am aware that there are on-going discussions, and I do not know how helpful their inclusion would be. We do not have the whole picture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the first time in this Committee I confess that I am less than happy with my ability to command this subject matter —I am not a lawyer, and I am certainly not a European lawyer. I want to be reassured that, whatever the Committee's decisions or recommendations, subsequent debate when the legislation is introduced in the House will not be prejudiced. I hope that my lawyer friends will have advised me more thoroughly by that time, and I shall be able to make a better assessment of the full implications of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. I can certainly assure him to the extent that the framework document will have to be incorporated in our law, and the Bill that incorporates it will be scrutinised by both Houses of Parliament in the normal way. At this point, however, we are of course accepting the principles of the framework document. Therefore, the subsequent law will have to comply with and bring into force those framework decisions. I am afraid, therefore, that this is the House's opportunity to scrutinise the content and requirements of the framework document, although the details of the law will be scrutinised by Parliament in the normal way. We will certainly not be free of the framework document's provisions when we come to frame the law that will subsequently be considered by the House.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maples <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me with paragraph 8 of the consultation document published by the Government in March? In discussing fast-track extradition, which has resulted in the European arrest warrant, it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We would welcome views on whether the following should continue to be non-extraditable:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(1) Military offences which are not also offences in general criminal law;"—</p></blockquote>
and, perhaps more importantly—
<br><blockquote><p>"iii) Offences which are not offences under the law of the requested state where the requesting state has taken on extraterritorial jurisdiction."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that has been important in one or two recent cases—the Pinochet extradition, for instance, in which a magistrate in Spain sought to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction. Belgian magistrates have sought to do the same thing. Will the Minister let the Committee know the response to that consultation? What views were expressed to the Home Office? It seems that neither of the offences mentioned has been made an exception in the Council document under discussion. In other words, the European arrest warrant could apply to military offences that are not offences in general criminal law, and to the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by another country in the European Union. I may be mistaken about that, so perhaps the Minister will draw my attention to the relevant passages in the document. It seems to me that those are significant omissions regarding matters on which consultation was requested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse on the consultation responses at this moment, although I shall try to do so during the debate. The relevant document was placed in the Library in October—on 24 October, I think—and I shall try to clarify the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the concern that people might have focuses on article 2(2) and the offences that do not require double criminality. Most of that list is entirely uncontroversial, because in practice, nearly all those offences are crimes. As has been pointed out, however, some of them, such as xenophobia, are not defined as crimes in Britain. Will the Minister comment on the likely distinction between a case in which an accused person had been practising xenophobia in the country requesting the warrant, a case in which he had previously had nothing to do with that country, and the middle case in which he had been projecting propaganda over the internet—for example, he might have been based in Britain and aimed the propaganda at Germany? Has the Minister considered a differentiated approach?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although that offence does not exist in UK law, certain offences would be extraditable to the UK under that category—for example, offences aggravated by racial motives. My hon. Friend is right, but there is broad acceptance—which I hope he shares—that we should recognise the law in another country as it exists. There is little doubt that the priorities and legal requirements in, for example, Germany, because of its history, are different from those in this country. German people should not be allowed to come to Britain and break British law and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
British people should not be allowed to go to Germany and break German law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful for the Minister's clarification of his opening comments and the apparent discrepancy in his letter stating that dual criminality would apply in relation to article 2(4), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The surrender may be subject to the condition"</p></blockquote>
and then refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"abortion, euthanasia, morality, sexuality, or freedom of expression and association."</p></blockquote>
What was the thinking behind the measure, which gives a prescriptive list of offences that will come within the remit of European arrest warrants? Article 2(2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The following offences … shall … give rise to a surrender pursuant to a European arrest warrant",</p></blockquote>
but the moral grey area of the offences that we are discussing is covered by the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"may be subject to".</p></blockquote>
Some of these offences are at the cutting edge between what is criminal and what is immoral. It is a grey area and people will look for clearer guidance than simply that the surrender "may be" subject to a condition. At what stage during the process will that controversial aspect be clarified?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All kinds of methodologies were kicked around in the framing of the proposal, including negative lists, positive lists and complete abolition of dual criminality. By and large, the British Government favoured the maximum position: abolition of dual criminality. We do not believe that in the modern world, with the amount of movement of people that takes place in the European Union, we can survive with the antiquated arrangements in place at the moment. If we accept that, as I do, it is clear that the choices open to us are either a Europe-wide framework of law that would apply to everyone—huge complications would arise in framing such a body of law that would be acceptable to everyone with their different traditions—or dual recognition of one another's systems within the framework of the European convention on human rights. That is the position that the British Government chose, and we have been at the forefront in pushing for it. We believe that the restrictions on recognition of other people's legal systems should be minimised. We are not sure to what degree they would present problems in practice, but we are fully aware of some of the concerns in those areas that are not covered by the positive list in article 2(2). In drafting the regulations we must be mindful of those concerns, and we know that we must satisfy Members of the House on the exact details of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody <span class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the trouble with abandoning traditional laws, which are often antiquated, is that we often abandon the rights of the citizen at the same time? When he says that we must consider whether those conditions are met under the order, does he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
accept that once the framework decision is put on to the statute book, the Government's right, and in particular Parliament's right, to oppose this kind of interpretation will almost cease to exist? Will he tell us the meaning of his interpretation of the differences in tense? Is he certain that Parliament will be able to reject unacceptable aspects of the decision if the regulations are proposed after the Houses of Parliament have accepted the framework?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to tell the Committee that we can reject the framework document, because we cannot reject its provisions once it has been accepted. I do not know which part of the document is troubling my hon. Friend. The offences contained within and described by article 2(2) will be subject to joint recognition. We shall not be able to say that we will not extradite people when they are wanted for a crime described in article 2(2). That is clear, and I am not trying to con either the Committee or my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Issues not contained in the positive list in article 2(2) will continue to have dual criminality requirements if a member state so wishes. That will be a matter for the Government to decide, and their decision will be scrutinised by Parliament. The extent to which we continue to apply dual criminality to offences not on the positive list in article 2(2) is wholly within our power—I hope that my hon. Friend does not understand the situation differently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should understand that there is still grave concern among Government and Opposition Members, some of whom have already spoken in Committee, and in another place. The provisions of the framework document include many generic terms that are not specific offences under English law. Will the Minister reconsider his opening statement in which he remarked, "There is nothing new here"? He sought to persuade the Committee that there is no change because we have had extradition arrangements for many years.<br><br>
Does the Minister understand that such distinguished noble lords as Lord Lester of Herne Hill, Lord Scott of Foscote and many others have expressed concerns about the framework decision because its terms are so vague? The provisions of extradition treaties have always been extraordinarily precise. Anyone charged with an offence on the generic list in article 2(2), which might attract a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment in another jurisdiction but not be a crime under English law, might suddenly be brought before the courts and transported abroad in custody without any opportunity to challenge the matter. That is why there is concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I said in my opening remarks, "There is nothing new here", I was discussing the recognition of judicial authorities in other EU countries because the Committee had flagged up its concern that the definition of a judicial authority was inadequate. If the Committee wants me to, I can go through lists of every recent extradition case to another EU country showing which judicial authority requested that case. Such authorities are necessarily different because each country has a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
different legal framework, but the framework document does not consider those differences. There is no danger, as members of the Committee have suggested, that police authorities will apply for extradition warrants. I did not say that there were no differences between the proposal and what is in operation; clearly, there are.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that absolute, specific crimes should be spelled out in the list and that generic terms should be done away with. If we went down that route, drawing up the list would be as complex as the arguments that we now face on determining dual criminality in individual cases. We are trying to get away from that antiquated approach because it leads constantly to arguments, delays and repeat judicial reviews of cases—and years before anyone can be extradited. The purpose of the generic list is to encapsulate those crimes in an acceptable form for all EU members. It is up to the issuing judicial authority to frame the warrant for an offence in its country and ensure that the offence complies with one generic item on the list. Yes, that is a big change, but it will be a big gain if we see effective extradition arrangements between us and our European partners. That would be new and beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Palmer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give the Minister notice of a question that I shall raise in the debate, although he may be able to answer it on the spot. Does he think that a translation error has occurred in article 4(3)? It appears to allow the executing state's judicial authorities to decide not to prosecute or halt proceedings. However, the executing state is not prosecuting in any case, nor is it holding proceedings, so I wonder whether the paragraph should refer to the issuing state. If it is meant to refer to the executing state, is that a fall-back position for difficult cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the text is right. It covers the situation in which a decision has already been taken not to prosecute an individual, such as a British person who could be prosecuted in France, or a decision has been taken, for the same alleged crime, not to prosecute him in Britain. In such cases, we would not be required to extradite him to face a French court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boris Johnson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Henley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me to clarify the change of which he speaks by considering a particular case? He talked about introducing mutual recognition of legal standards. That will introduce an idea from commercial law in the EU—that we all accept that one thing is as good as another throughout the Community—into criminal law. However, in the case of the 12 plane-spotters, alluded to in the press, there has been a different appreciation of the issues. Greece does not appear to have a ready understanding of plane-spotting, and has a different approach to habeas corpus; it has kept those people for three weeks without trial. Were those people to have returned to this country and an EU arrest warrant to have been made for their return to Greece, would the proposal have made it easier for the Greeks to get them back to Greece? Would the effect of the proposal be a speedier system than that under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
current extradition laws? Is that the change to which the Minister alludes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always fraught with difficulty for a Minister to comment on individual cases. The only thing to say to the hon. Gentleman is that we should not frame our decisions in this place on the basis of press reports about the criminal justice system as it operates in another country. We should certainly not do so where British criminals face judicial systems in foreign countries or where foreigners face the judicial system of this country. That is not a reliable guide to where justice lies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Cairns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a much briefer question. What are the implications, if any, for Scotland of the existence of different criminal law systems in this country, and what input have Scottish law officers had?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend will know, this is an issue on which the Home Office leads for the United Kingdom. However, the Scottish Executive and Scottish legal authorities were consulted when the original documents on proposed changes to extradition law were drawn up, and they were also consulted during the past few months' discussions on specific proposals in the framework document. They were happy with the proposals, but I should stress again that the Home Office led the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask about the breadth of the definitions in article 2(2), which relates to the concern expressed by the Scrutiny Committee in a previous report about the vagueness—in some cases, complete absence—of the definition of offences involving dual criminality. For example, have the Government worked out which offences in English law—or in Scottish law, for that matter—are covered by the general headings of high-tech crime, environmental crime, and racism and xenophobia? In keeping with the question from the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), and in the light of the Government's promised Bill, how would we deal with a situation in which Parliament did not want a British person to be extradited to another EU country, on the ground that the offence in question did not exist in the UK? There would be no reason for the person concerned to assume that the act in question was an offence in that country, and there is the genuine concern that they might be extradited for it. The simple principle, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", is not easy to apply in the context of legal consequences such as detention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be for the issuing authority to frame its warrant according to the offences listed in article 2(2). The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: on drafting the Bill we will not have the ability to say that we are unwilling to accept application of the European arrest warrant to an area that is covered by the positive list. As with cases in this country, ignorance of the law is not a protection from it. However, we would rely on those in the country in question accepting mitigating circumstances when such a trial took place.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept the broad thrust of our position. If we are to expect our European neighbours to have confidence in our legal system and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
to extradite their nationals to face justice in this country, we must show the same confidence in return. However, thus far, some European Union countries have not been prepared to show such confidence. Potentially, if a national of such a country committed a serious crime on our streets, the prospect of getting him to return to this country to face justice would be minimal, if not non-existent. None the less, we cannot be prejudiced. We cannot expect our European neighbours to accept and show confidence in our judicial system by allowing it to apply to nationals who have committed crimes in this country, if we are not prepared to accept the reverse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me with article 2 of the proposals? I completely understand paragraphs (2) and (4), but I do not understand paragraph (3):
<br><blockquote><p>"For offences other than those referred to in paragraph 2, the surrender may be subject"</p></blockquote>
—presumably, under our legislation—
<br><blockquote><p>"to the condition that the acts justifying the issue of the European arrest warrant constitute an offence under the law of the executing State",</p></blockquote>
which, in our case, would be the United Kingdom. I imagine that the intention is that any offence not listed in paragraph (2) would be subject to the dual criminality rule. That would be the meaning if the paragraph stopped at that point. I do not understand what is meant by the addition of
<br><blockquote><p>"where the acts were committed fully or partly on the territory of the executing State."</p></blockquote>
I have thought about it on and off for about three days, but I simply cannot understand it. If it means that the offence was committed partly in the United Kingdom, the offence would be prosecutable in the United Kingdom and the offender would not be subject to extradition to another country. Alternatively, it could be an attempt to introduce the concept of extraterritoriality, which I asked the Minister about earlier. However, if it is intended to provide a get-out when a foreign judicial authority tries to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction, why would it not apply to the paragraph (2) offences as well? At best, the provision is badly drafted and confusing and, at worst, it does not mean anything.<br><br>
I may be wrong, and I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the paragraph. With the help of two or three people in the Library and a couple of lawyers, I have tried to understand it but cannot. If the intention is to apply dual criminality to offences not listed in paragraph (2), the final words
<br><blockquote><p>"where the acts were committed fully or partly on the territory of the executing State"</p></blockquote>
are superfluous. Otherwise, it is complicated and unclear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know which document and paragraph the hon. Gentleman refers to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Article 2(3) of the conclusions of the presidency of the Council dated 31 October, which begins:
<br><blockquote><p>"For offences other than those referred to in paragraph 2".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
I do not understand what is added or taken away by the final line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is working with an earlier version of the text than the one I have. I will try to return to his point during the debate; that is all that I can say at the moment. A copy of the text that he is using has just been given to me, and it is not the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. Perhaps I can assist the Minister. The text that my hon. Friend is using is the one that was supplied to members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The up-to-date text has been supplied to the Committee, but that is not it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths. I have been working from the papers that I picked up as I entered the Room. The rule of the House of Commons is that, if papers are to be discussed in a Committee—including a European Committee—they are to be supplied to Members. I wish to raise questions on article 16 about decisions that are extrajudicial and superior to those of British judges, and on articles 17 and 18. Am I to understand that I have been working from a text that is not the same as the Minister's? That would constitute a minor problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for making that comment. I have looked at the papers, and it appears that the papers that we in the Committee received were handled within the Committee structure. The paper that has just been handed to the Minister is the up-to-date version from the Home Office. As it is apparent that there is a difference, I ought to suspend the Committee, if not postpone it. I will suspend the Committee for a maximum of 15 minutes so that the usual channels can try to sort something out. If they cannot do so in that time, I will adjourn the Committee until a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths. We are in no way challenging your view, as that is probably the immediate and sensible response. However, the hazard in suspending the Committee is that even if the usual channels come to an agreement, we will still be unable to access the papers from which the Minister is working. I hope that you adjourn the Committee, as it would be very unwise for proceedings on something so important to the individual freedoms of United Kingdom citizens to continue without the text that we are supposed to be discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Griffiths.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: order. Members could go on raising points of order for a long time. If it appears—I should be a part of the discussion—that there are several differences between the texts, it would not be fair to carry on, and I will adjourn the proceedings. We will have a quick look; if there are several changes, we will have to adjourn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before you do so, Mr. Griffiths, may I say that I already know the point of view of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Opposition Front-Bench team? I wish to take further legal advice. We have taken legal advice on the text that we thought was to be debated this afternoon, and I shall be submitting the content of discussions with the Minister. The Committee should be adjourned, because as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich has just said, on an issue as important as this, 15 minutes is not enough time to get such advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point order, Mr. Griffiths. I received a copy of the text to which I referred from the Library last week. I took the trouble today of getting the package of papers from the Vote Office, and I have just checked the wording of the paragraph in that text, and it is exactly the same. This seems absolutely inexcusable on the part of the Government. Many of us have spent hours in preparation for this Committee, because we consider it an extremely important matter. We have set aside the afternoon, and I have cancelled several other meetings so as to be able to attend. The Government owe us a huge apology. We would like to know who is to blame for wasting the time of this Committee. Many hon. Members who are not permanent members of this Committee have taken the trouble to come here today. Such a lapse is quite extraordinary.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall see whether the matter can be sorted out. If there are significant problems and changes, I will rule that the Committee be adjourned until a later date.</span></p>
<p>5.12 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>5.16 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must rule on the matter. The Committee has the most up-to-date text, but unfortunately the Minister does not have the same text. In those circumstances, although hon. Members might ask questions about only two or three points in the whole document, it would not be appropriate or satisfactory for the Minister to try to answer them. I shall therefore adjourn the Committee until a convenient date.</span></p>
<p>Debate adjourned—<i>[Mr. Hopkins.]</i></p>
