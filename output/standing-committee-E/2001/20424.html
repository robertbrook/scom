	<div class='legislation'>Food Hygiene</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Yvette Cooper)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals in European Union document 10427/00 represent a much needed and important opportunity to overhaul European Union legislation on food hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As originally presented, the document comprised five measures. The first is a regulation on hygiene rules applicable to all food sectors. Of the five, it involves the most significant changes in approach. The second is a regulation on specific hygiene rules that should apply, in addition, to products of animal origin. It involves a lot of consolidation of existing measures. The third regulation, on official controls on products of animal origin, has been withdrawn and will, I understand, be presented by the Commission at a later date in a reworked form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth is a regulation consolidating existing animal health provisions on the marketing of products of animal origins. Negotiation on such matters is the responsibility of DEFRA, but it is predominantly a consolidation of existing measures. The fifth proposal is a directive to repeal existing legislation. It tidies up the legislation and directives that are affected by the previous proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to be clear that the proposals do not cover the prevention or control of BSE, which is the subject of separate legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are under discussion. There have been extensive and lengthy negotiations Council working group on the first two proposals, both of which have also reached First Reading stage in the European Parliament Environment Committee. The third proposal has been withdrawn for further consideration and the fourth and fifth proposals are yet to be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the European Parliament's First Reading report is due to be adopted on 14 May and that it is the intention that the presidency of the Agriculture Council at the end of the June should agree a common position on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, briefly, to cover the proposals. We are not starting with a blank sheet of paper. Much of this hygiene package is about delivering existing good practice and consolidating existing measures. Many food businesses already exceed the requirements of the new approach and, for most, the basics of day-to-day food hygiene practice will not change as a result of this recasting and simplification exercise. However, some of the additional elements in the approach are viewed by the Food Standards Agency as important, in that, compared with current legislation, they enhance the food safety assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The first proposal, which is on the hygiene of foodstuffs, applies to all food businesses. It is the cornerstone of the package. It extends to all foodstuffs the existing principles embodied in Council directive 93/43/EEC. The most significant of those are the paramount concern to protect human health, the use of measures based on HACCP principles—hazard analysis and critical control points—to control food safety, the use of industry guides to good hygiene practice to underpin compliance and the obligation on food business operators to ensure that only foodstuffs that are not harmful to human health are placed on the market. The important element of that is the introduction of a requirement for all food business operators other than primary producers to apply the HACCP principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HACCP is a structured food safety management system internationally regarded as the most effective approach to preventing food safety problems and is based on seven principles, systematically applied. They relate to the identification of hazards to be controlled and of the stages in production where controls need to be applied; the establishment of the nature and extent of the controls; the setting and implementation of procedures to monitor the controls in operation; the establishment of corrective actions to be taken where the monitoring process demonstrates a need; the verification that the measures are working effectively; and the establishment and maintenance of documentation to demonstrate the system and its effective implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first proposal also seeks to ensure that good hygiene practice is established throughout the food chain, starting with primary production. Primary producers will not be subject to the full application of HACCP principles; instead, the control of possible hazards in primary production will be addressed in codes of practice. Primary producers will need to follow good practice and to manage their operations in such a way that hazards are acceptably controlled. That is referred to as a hazard-based approach. The proposal also provides for the continuation and extension of the existing system of voluntary guides to good practice to help food business operators to comply with the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the aim of improving the traceability of food, the proposal would require food businesses to be registered by the competent authority—including the allocation of a registration number to each of them—and to have adequate procedures to withdraw food from the market where there is an unacceptable risk to health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal would also allow flexibility in controls for small and medium-sized enterprises, such as those situated in remote or mountainous regions, and for the manufacture of traditional products. Member states could, under the proposals, grant certain derogations for those enterprises, so long as that was acceptable to the European Commission and did not compromise the overall objective of food hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposal lays down specific additional hygiene rules for food of animal origin to complement the general hygiene requirements in the first proposal. Some of the existing legislation in this area is over
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
35 years old. Naturally, it reflects the understanding of, and approach to, public health issues at the time when it was made. In general, that has meant a detailed, prescriptive approach to hygiene, with the imposition of specific standards for, say, the construction of premises, hygiene measures and production processes, which has not tended to keep pace with new developments in food production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal aims to reduce and rationalise the detailed prescriptive requirements applying to products of animal origin. Again, certain controlled derogations for particular small and medium-sized enterprises are proposed. To give the Committee an idea of the consequences of shifting from the prescriptive to the hazard-based approach, the new proposal would remove a significant amount of prescriptive detail from current legislation, particularly in relation to the construction of premises. For example, the current meat product legislation requires that walls have a washable, covered surface up to a height of at least 2 m. The new approach would make it clear that premises should be easy to clean, able to be disinfected where necessary and not be a hazard to the foodstuffs. That would allow individual businesses the flexibility to respond to their particular circumstances and the risk to their particular products, rather than obliging them to follow a prescription as to the height and texture of the surface.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, the third proposal has been withdrawn. The fourth consolidates existing animal health rules for products of animal origin intended for human consumption. The overall objective is to prevent the spread of animal diseases resulting from products of animal origin. Negotiations have not yet started on the proposal. Overall, we support it, but there are points of detail that it will be important to clarify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth proposal repeals or amends the existing EU legislation, paving the way for the new approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FSA has consulted widely with stakeholders with an interest in the food hygiene proposals. I understand that they have generally welcomed the strategic direction of the proposals, especial the farm-to-fork approach, the focus on hazard-based food safety management systems and the simplified legislation. Many respondents have raised concerns about the potential impact on smaller businesses, particularly about how the application of HACCP-based food safety management systems can be effective and proportionate in those circumstances. That is an important issue that we need to address during both the negotiations on and the implementation of the proposals. The views of the stakeholders have been taken into account in formulating the Government's attitude; we think that this is an important opportunity to establish integrated, consistent and effective legislation to underpin the safe production of all food. It is important that the legislation should be enforceable and proportionate to the risk to public health. We welcome the clarification that responsibility for producing food safety should rest unambiguously with operators, and that it should be based on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
need to control hazards. We also welcome the fact that, for the first time, the proposals would clearly embrace primary producers within the farm-to-fork control continuum. Independent scrutiny by the enforcement authorities should provide the necessary checks to ensure that operators' controls are adequate and effective. There must be robust enforcement, and appropriate penalties if business controls are found to be ineffective to the extent that they may jeopardise public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government policy has been to encourage the application of HACCP principles in all food sectors other than primary production; it has been so for a long time. In practice, most food businesses are already required to operate on the basis of five of the seven HACCP principles. In addition, there was a Government commitment to HACCP when the recommendations of the Pennington report were accepted following the serious E.coli 0157 food poisoning outbreak in central Scotland. The FSA has pursued those recommendations. In addition, the national legislation licensing certain butchers shops, which Parliament introduced following that outbreak, is conditional on those business operating on the basis of all seven HACCP-based principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth trying to understand what the proposals mean in practice. On the one hand, some of our outdated prescriptive measures, such as those for wall heights, may be removed; on the other hand, we can focus on the actual risks involved. It will be made clear that businesses will have to take responsibility. Most food businesses are already obliged to operate the five of the HACCP principles under directive 93/43 on general food hygiene. The two additional principles are about verification and documentation, so that businesses can properly check what they are doing and to bring inspection and enforcement into line with the risk-based approach rather than simply enforcing prescriptions that may sometimes be irrelevant to the risks involved. We should also be clear that this does not involve bringing in detailed HACCP teams with expertise to every business. It applies the principles in way that is appropriate for each business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The internationally accepted HACCP-based approach is flexible, and it can be applied proportionately to the nature of the risks inherent in any given food production process. There is no reason why small businesses in the UK cannot apply HACCP principles effectively. However, we should not underestimate the need for support. The FSA's view is that there is no reason why the application of HACCP principles should present an unjustified or unmanageable burden on small business enterprises, partly because many of them will already be applying a HACCP approach but also because a number of small business and small business organisations support the use of HACCP principles, including the National Federation of Meat Traders; so long as it is proportionate. Many will need assistance. The FSA are working on that, and the matter will be dealt with also in discussions and negotiations. We know from local authorities' surveillance activities that when businesses have effective management controls in place, the control of food safety will ultimately have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
an impact on consumers and public health will improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulatory impact assessment strongly indicates that the application of HACCP principles is not seen to present any great burden by small and medium-sized enterprises, and retail businesses consulted are already complying with the major elements. A realistic timetable for business to adopt a HACPP-based approach will be key. With that in mind, the FSA is already doing a lot of work to increase the uptake of HACCP principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider that there is scope to seek further rationalisation and simplification of the proposed requirements without comprising food safety, particularly in relation to the second proposal. The proposals for registration of food businesses, especially their application to primary producers, and identification and marking of produce to improve tractability will require further consideration, given that there is now an overlap in those areas with new EU regulations that lay down general principles of food law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some concerns about the application of the flexibility proposed for producers in certain circumstances. The exercise of flexibility would need to be carefully balanced against the primary objective of safeguarding public health. A risk-based approach to managing food safety hazards could be applied to all establishments and could improve the safety of our food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that sets out the scope of the proposals, the stakeholders' views and the Government's approach. Food safety is extremely important to consumers and they have a right to expect that high levels of protection will result from the proposals. Those are the broad objectives and I hope that the Committee will unite and support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Under-Secretary. I remind hon. Members that these should be brief and be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions. The motion will be debated after questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the aims of consolidation and simplification. We welcome the emphasis on the whole food chain and the flexibility of HACCP. There are several areas on which I would like to question the Under-Secretary, including the effect on small business and the effect on the robust enforcement of public health standards in the UK. Perhaps I can start with the issue of consistency of regulation and its implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that under the first proposal there is to be an element of flexibility for small and medium-sized enterprises, for regions with geographical constraints such as mountains and remote islands and for traditional products. In the second proposal, flexibility is again allowed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regional producers. The Food and Drink Federation thinks that there should not be exemptions for certain premises, operations, regions,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
special geographical constraints, local markets or traditional methods. Its view is that the correct application of HACCP should mean an automatic application of an appropriate level of regulatory control for the business in question. Although the UK may follow whatever regime is decided on in a straightforward and careful way, others may use whatever opportunities emerge to promote their businesses. Is the Under-Secretary satisfied that the exemptions and derogations are satisfactory in terms of British interests?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of consistency of application, is she satisfied with the proposal that each country should have its own guide to the introduction of the proposals, rather than a Europe-wide guide'? Is she happy with the thought that a move to more self-regulation may lead to less effective or less rigorous authorities enforcing the procedures? In other words, what is her view of the level playing field?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point. We have some concerns about the flexibility based on geographical features such as mountains. I have a lot of sympathy with the point that the whole purpose of HACCP is to provide a flexible approach to the different kinds of risk present in different kinds of food businesses and different operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are concerned about the provision for derogations under which the full requirements would not apply to certain businesses depending on their size, the remoteness of their location or their traditional production methods. It is important that such derogations reflect risk. That will be an important part of the discussions that need to take place to ensure that the legislation is flexible enough. It must be able to respond to different levels of risk and different circumstances without creating perverse loopholes that might cause problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about whether there should be greater adaptation and variety in member states, we would resist allowing them to adapt the requirements of the general food hygiene regulation and would want some consistency. Flexibility should be about different kinds of businesses and the circumstances that they face, not about member states taking broadly different approaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I served on the Special Select Committee that considered the setting up of the FSA, we were concerned that prescriptive regulations might drive out of business small quality food producers and people who used traditional techniques. Such techniques might be perfectly safe, but they might not fit in with new regulations because they were no longer mainstream. Am I right in saying that today's proposals will make it easier for such companies to flourish and to produce quality food that is safe and actually tastes good?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention behind changing the approach and removing some of the most prescriptive regulations, which have nothing to do with modern production techniques or traditional production techniques that take account of food
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
safety. In terms of practical outcomes for consumers, it is far more sensible to focus on the risks in each production, retail and delivery process. In many respects, businesses that take a risk-based approach should feel that the burden of regulation has been reduced, because they will no longer have to comply with inappropriate regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other issues that we could mention, and we might be able to deal further with the prescriptions that have been retained in the proposals. That would require stakeholders fully to discuss safety and risks; part of those interesting discussions would be to discover whether we could make any changes through the European process. We may have gone as far as we can go at this stage, but I agree with my hon. Friend about the intention behind taking a hazard-based and risk-based approach, rather than a prescriptive approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary spoke about relaxing the approach and about taking a risk-based approach, rather than a prescriptive one. UK companies currently abide by many regulations that would no longer apply under the new approach. Has she examined which regulations would be relaxed? She mentioned cleaning heights; the relevant regulation currently applies in the UK. How would it alter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I arrived, I was trying to find some good examples to give the Committee, because I thought that that would be the best way to make tangible the differences that would arise in practice. The best example that we came up with was the current requirements for the height of the washable wall, and before we finish, I shall ask my officials for other clear examples. The FSA has extensively analysed the impact of the proposals and which regulations will change for food businesses, and I shall see whether I can refer to more examples when I sum up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea as regards wall-washing is that owners would simply have to ensure that their premises could be appropriately cleaned or, where necessary, disinfected, whatever the height of the walls; they would not have to comply with requirements stipulating a particular height of washable wall surface. They would simply have to ensure that the premises were unlikely to introduce a hazard or risk into the production process, rather than having to consider a technical specification in regard to the heights of different walls that bears no relation to whether risks are being introduced into the production process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. lain Luke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Concerns have recently been raised with me about the effect of the proposed directive. The argument that people have put to me is that it would limit their right to choose effective natural health therapies and to receive information about scientific developments in natural health. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary comment on those concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any reason why that would cause a problem. I do not know whether my hon. Friend can give me any more information,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
but if he is content to wait until later, I shall see whether my officials can give me any further advice on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone who was, en passant, involved with environmental health matters in my previous job, may I say that I very much welcome these positive measures? However, there are one or two problems. I am concerned about the third proposal in particular, which I note has been withdrawn. That is interesting, because it is potentially the most important proposal. Why has it been withdrawn, and what measures will the Minister take to ensure that the veterinary supervision of abattoirs will be placed on a level playing field? I am thinking, in particular, about the closure of the smaller abattoirs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the concern of the FSA about the third proposal centred on ensuring that none of the measures should be burdensome and that they should be capable of being applied flexibly. I know that when the third proposal was first outlined, the FSA was involved in extensive discussions with stakeholders. The important principle is that the inspection process should reflect the hazard-based approach. There should not be an additional parallel system, where the inspection focuses on completely different issues or uses different tests. That is why it is important that the first proposal provides for the extension of the HACCP principles from five to seven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By introducing issues of verification and documentation as part of the HACCP process, it will be possible better to align the inspection enforcement process with the process of risk management in a business. The responsibility for safe food production should lie with the business, not with the enforcement agency. It should be part of the culture of the business to produce safe food, rather than merely responding to what the inspector says is acceptable. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any further details at this stage about the direction of discussions on the third proposal. I understand that the Commission will put forward a reworked proposal, but I am not sure of the precise timetable for that. I assume that the third proposal will be put forward for scrutiny by this Committee at a future date, so we will have an opportunity to discuss it then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony D. Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Yarmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When companies register, and if foodstuffs have to be withdrawn, will they have to prove what procedures were in place?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, responsibility for ensuring that the product is safe shifts to the company or the food business. However, the situation regarding the withdrawal of safe products would not change as a result of the proposals. The proposals improve and consolidate the process of risk management, preventing unsafe products from reaching the market. If they do reach the market, the current restrictions, legislation and protection for the consumer would apply. I will make sure that I have clarified that properly when I come to my final remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although there is still a feeling that our domestic producers are sometimes penalised because they adhere to higher standards than their foreign competitors, the Opposition obviously welcome some of the measures. Having said that, is the Minister satisfied that enough is being done to regulate the flow of food—particularly illegal meat, about which we will hear more later—coming into the country? I wonder what she would say to John Averns, London's port health director, who, among others, has called for more staff and legislation, and greater powers to search bags. It is one thing to tighten up and comply in our domestic markets; it is quite another to stop the inflow of products that do not meet any recognised hygiene standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the legal framework of the proposals, it is clear that the standards of risk management and food safety that apply to production across the UK and EU also apply to imports. The document suggests setting out clearly the countries that have the right systems, institutional structures and legal framework in place to comply, and where the EU Food and Veterinary Office will be able to carry out checks that that is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the separate issue of enforcement. He may be aware that DEFRA is carrying out a full review of enforcement in order to make sure that imports of unsafe products of animal origin and, in particular, meat are being properly addressed, and to see whether more—or something different—needs to be done to protect public health. A full of review of enforcement is going on at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about compliance across the EU. I am concerned that there is still a tendency for the UK to set up a regime that is harsher than that which applies in Europe. I noted the Minister's earlier comment that she wanted to see compliance across the board. There is a problem at the moment—my predecessor and I pressed the FSA on it for some time, and got absolutely nowhere—with the extraction of bivalve molluscs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations in France and the Netherlands currently state that if molluscs fail to pass a test, one cannot extract them, and when one has the green light one can extract them, which is a common-sense approach. In the UK, we have a system by which if molluscs fail a number of tests over several months, come September one is stopped from extracting them for the next 12 months, despite the fact that such mussels and oysters may be edible during that period. That approach has decimated the bivalve mollusc industry in my constituency and other areas. Will the Minister assure me that that will be looked into, that we will have a level playing field and that the FSA will take a common-sense approach and listen to the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment directly on bivalve molluscs, but the idea is to have a consistent approach across Europe. One relevant factor is that we are talking about regulations rather than directives. Countries often implement directives in different ways in their regulations. In the UK, we transpose directives into our secondary legislation, but that is not the way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
in which that case would be dealt with. The regulation would come into force, as it stands, right across the EU. There would be no question of a different legal framework applying in different countries. The issue would come down to whether or not there was differential enforcement across the EU. The FSA's approach to all negotiations, and the Government's approach to negotiations in Council, will be consistent. I am happy to respond further to the hon. Gentleman on the specific example that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) made a point about imports, and I notice that page 15 of the regulatory impact assessment refers to their impact on primary producers. It talks about the assured chicken production scheme, pointing out that in the UK every flock has to have a health and welfare plan in place, has to be tested for salmonella and has to have sick and injured animals withdrawn from it. As far as I am aware, that scheme does not apply to chickens imported from overseas, which is a point that is always made when one visits a chicken farm. Is the Minister saying that the assured chicken production scheme will be adequate for the purposes of the proposed regulations, and that it, or something similar, will apply to chickens from Thailand and Brazil?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important test will not be whether a particular scheme applies, but whether different countries fulfil both the HACCP requirements and overall food safety requirements. There may be different ways of doing that, but the important thing will be that they are implementing the right kind of risk-based approach and achieving the right levels of food safety. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a guarantee that individual requirements will apply to individual countries because the important thing will be that they meet appropriate standards. It will be for the European Commission to ensure that imports from particular countries into the whole of the EU meet the standards set out in those proposals because it would be inappropriate to have standards that apply only in the EU, but not to imported produce. It will be important that any country importing any product, be it chicken, meat or whatever, to this country and the EU has the right standards in place to be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been advised by my officials that the issue about bivalve molluscs was covered in proposal 3, which is one of the areas that has been withdrawn, and will come back before the Scrutiny Committee at a future date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned about derogations in the context of the European Union because unless we are clear about what they are going to be, there will be room for misunderstanding. I am particularly concerned about the manufacture and marketing of traditional products, and we need to be clear about what we mean. I was wondering whether the Minister would define that a little more closely and perhaps give us some examples of the kind of things that she considers to be traditional products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suggested earlier, that is an area about which the FSA has some concerns. The approach needs to be both risk-based and public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
health-based, and not simply based on categories of food that should be exempt from standards of public health, food safety or hygiene simply because of their particular origin. The FSA's approach to the negotiations and discussions in that area will be to probe exactly those kinds of issues in considerable detail. I will obviously listen closely to the Committee's view on that point because the hon. Gentleman is right that that is something that needs to be pinned down in order to put the right kinds of standards in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to this may well be that it is DEFRA's responsibility. However, foot and mouth—particularly in my part of the world—has had a great effect on farmers and producers. There is, for example, one cattle market, which is struggling to reopen, left in Axminster. What assistance can be given to ensure that the cattle markets that remain up and down the country can reopen without being swamped by legislation? What aid is proposed to help them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have advised hon. Members that one question should be asked at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is referring to the broader problems faced as a result of foot and mouth or by particular parts of the agriculture industry, of course he is right. My answer has to be that this is a matter for DEFRA, which takes it very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of support for businesses to comply with the proposals, the FSA is already working to see what kind of support individual businesses and organisations need, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. It has been developing a HACCP strategy to provide support, advice and assistance to businesses to help them take up the HACCP approach, but to do so in a flexible way that suits them. They then will not feel that they need to call in outside expertise; the huge HACCP teams with extensive experience in big factories, which would not be appropriate for some organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response to the proposals addresses the issue of support for organisations. Obviously, in this forum, I cannot give a broader answer on support for the agriculture industry in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that all the HACCP procedures will apply once a chicken has arrived in this country, can the Minister explain how we can trace back that the chicken—whether it has come from Thailand or Brazil—has been subject to HACCP-equivalent procedures? How can we ensure that traceability and enforcement are properly dealt with in that part of the chain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission will be responsible for ensuring that approved third countries have the right procedures in place to monitor their approved food establishments that produce food products of animal origin for export to the EU and check that they continue to comply with food hygiene arrangements. Countries with clear, established inspection procedures and enforcement mechanisms that already meet the conditions in the proposal will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
in a very different position from countries without such national controls or a national inspection framework. There, we might be looking at what individual companies and production plants have in place, whether over traceability, testing or an approach to the different standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal requires the European Commission to draw up lists of third countries and establishments from which products of animal origin are permitted to be imported into the EU. Obviously, if the products arrive at a UK port or airport, the import controls for the inspection of imported food under current legislation also apply. The FVO will carry out inspection, and only plants approved as meeting requirements will be able to send products here. The officials inform me that those plants will then bear a health and veterinary certificate mark, which uniquely identifies plants and can be checked back. Traceability issues are being set out as part of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of food products contain an inherent risk, such as sheep-milk cheeses and green-top milk. Has the detail been thought through of what the impact of the regulation will be on those products? The consumer is aware of the risk of buying those products, and they are unsuitable for young children and older people in particular. I would be concerned that a risk assessment might be done and that, because there was a risk, they would be prevented from being sold. Can the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the issues that need to be pinned down as part of discussions and negotiations, but my understanding is that where there is clarity, where proper risk management processes have been applied and where full information is available, the proposal is not about restricting consumer choice with regard to such products. I will be happy to clarify that further for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the regulatory impact assessment seems to suggest that there will be some reduced costs. However, one area gives me some concern, although I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) will not agree with me. Where there is room for interpretation, there seems to me to be room for lawyers. At the moment, environmental health officers work to fairly didactic rules, and most people know where they stand. If we replace that environment with a more interpretive situation, where people have to justify what they are doing and the onus is on the retailer to decide whether what he is doing is appropriate, there might be room for lawyers to be involved. What assessment has the Minister made of any extra legal costs that will be involved for retailers and manufacturers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not aware that there will be a large increase in legal costs, although I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point that when there is a shift to a more interpretive and flexible approach, it potentially leaves more room for disagreement. It is very simple to say whether a washable wall measures 2 m, 3 m or 1.5 m—that is a clear statement of fact that no one can dispute. That is one of the challenges of moving towards a more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
flexible approach, but it would be ridiculous for us to be trapped in an approach that says that something must be 2 m, or whatever, simply because that is the simplest way to enforce and inspect a system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enforcement agencies, the food businesses and the Food Standards Agency will be required to do some work to ensure that interpretations are clear. That will be facilitated through the codes of good practice. It is clearly set out that there will be such codes, to inform different kinds of food businesses of what they need to do to meet the HACCP approach. That will reduce the likelihood of strongly different interpretations. The FSA wants the approach of the different enforcement and inspection officers to be to support businesses and work with them over what they are doing or not doing that might constitute a risk, and what they could and should be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we need to be alive to what the hon. Gentleman mentioned but, in practice, we should be able to respond to it. If we are to modernise the way in which food businesses are inspected and can produce their food, so that they can respond to, and introduce, new technologies and not be hidebound by traditional restrictive procedures, the proposal is the right way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal mentions guides to good practice and states, in article 7, that member states can encourage the development of guides. Article 8 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a Member State or the Commission considers that there is a need for uniform Community guides"</p></blockquote>
the Commission can consult and produce a Community-wide guide. The Food And Drink Federation supports the principle that, within a single market, there should be equivalent standards across the community. What is the UK Government's view? Do they consider that there is a need for uniform Community guides, or will they be happy with national ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a strong case for moving towards uniform Community guides, but that is a process that we shall work through. I think that it will come up in the discussions on the proposals as they proceed. Having standards that apply across the EU will be important in ensuring consistency but, equally, as part of the process and discussion leading to that, we might have greater flexibility in the shorter term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document contains a considerable amount about the training of hunters in health and hygiene, and the killing and transport of wild game to an approved establishment. I suggest that some of its drafting owes more to the tradition of our European partners than to our own. Given that some of it is draconian in the onus that it puts on small businesses, why is there little mention of fish? Why are the same principles not being applied to training for water bailiffs and those involved in river management? Surely that is equally important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very good question. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall reply in my summing up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that the FDF makes is that separate national guides could lead to non-tariff barriers to trade. Can the Minister explain how that might happen, how the Government will negotiate so that it does not, and what she views as the risks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of barriers to trade is what the single market is all about. To have differently applicable codes of practice, which make for strongly different standards in different countries and create problems for producers, would run counter to the principle of a single market. We would therefore not support it. We will pursue the issue at official-level negotiations, and in the Council. I assume that the European Parliament will also need to consider it in its discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that the Minister mentioned the words "codes of good practice". My background is in architecture, and building regulations are fairly short, but the guidance that goes with them is prescriptive. I hope that the guides to good practice will not also be prescriptive. It is important that they are Europe-wide, not just national, but where does the power of interpretation lie in the United Kingdom? Does it lie with the FSA, DEFRA, or some other body, and what powers of interpretation will be given to environmental health officers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The use of the guides to good practice is encouraged in the proposals, but the aim is that they remain voluntary not mandatory. Regardless of whether they are national or Community codes of practice, this is about informing the process of discussion between the business and the inspector, rather than about having a mandatory requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals state that the guides should be developed by the food and business sectors and representatives of other interested parties, including appropriate authorities and consumer groups. They make it clear that extensive consultation with the interests that will be substantially affected should take place. When we talk about Community guides, the proposals must be practicable for all sectors and interests. The process has plenty of scope for organisations, such as the Food and Drink Federation and different interest groups, to raise points and make clear their representations in relation to over-burdensome codes of practice and achieving consistency throughout the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the impact of the document on small businesses, a point that was made in representations during consultation with the Food Standard Agency was that the documentation requirements to prove that HACCP had been implemented could be substantial. Can the Minister tell us about her negotiating position on documentation requirements for small businesses to prove HACCP implementation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documentation requirements will vary from one business to another depending on the procedures that are operated; for example, they will be different for a corner sandwich shop than for a meat factory. That is an important part of having the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
flexibility to apply it to a particular process of production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documentation is important partly because businesses need to ensure that they are doing things properly—that they are checking the temperature of a refrigerator twice a day, or whatever it is that they need to do to ensure that the sandwiches are being kept safely. It is partly about facilitating the inspection process because it is not possible to shift the way in which the inspection processes work if the right sorts of documentation are not in place to support the HACCP process. If businesses cannot prove that they are doing that, it is harder for inspection to shift away from the prescriptive—"what are you doing? How high are the walls?"—to support of the HACCP approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it right that there are no particular requirements that have been worked out at the moment and that they are still in negotiation? If that is so, can the Minister tell us what the likely costs are for small businesses? I read the university of Wales institute research in the regulatory impact assessment. The costs referred to are all over the place. There is no clear picture of what the levels of cost for a small business might be. Later on, it describes the butcher's shop experience, with £1,000 to £5,000 needed for premises that are manufacturing and selling cooked meats. Does the Minister agree that there is a need to establish what the costs and documentation are likely to be, and to analyse the effects on small businesses so that the analysis can inform the Government's negotiating position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the issue is that first, those matters need to be pinned down through the discussions and negotiations, and secondly, the right kind of flexibility needs to be retained for each sort of business. That makes it difficult to pin down exactly what the cost will be to a typical business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no typical business because the impact on different sorts of business will vary. It will vary partly according to how much businesses are already doing in terms of the HACCP. For many, that is the sensible way of managing food safety, and is what they already should be doing. For those businesses there may be few additional costs, if any. For some, there may be additional savings because of the changes in the way that the inspections take place. For some, there may be additional costs because they may not be doing something. Issues of food safety then come into play. Evidence from local authorities, surveillance and different research shows that the HACCP process improves food safety and prevents all sorts of inappropriate operations from taking place and risks from being added to the process, so there are substantial public health gains in its introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite difficult to pin down the costs to a typical business. However, we need to carry out further work on supporting individual businesses, minimising the impact, and clearly assessing what it might mean for a sandwich shop, a small factory or a small retailer in different circumstances. We need to have more information about that, and the FSA has already been working to determine what sort of support small and medium-sized enterprises would need in order to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
comply. The FSA has been carrying out a lot of work on that, and on how to promote the HACCP approach. We need to carry out additional work, but it is something to which the FSA is alive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me take the question down to even smaller businesses. I am thinking of market stalls and farmers' markets. There are clear requirements in terms of the need for appropriate personal hygiene, sanitary and changing facilities. If a farmer had to put those on a stall, it would be difficult to make it economically viable. Has the Minister consulted about how far local authorities will assist in the provision of those facilities so that farmers markets and the like can comply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of what detailed discussions have taken place on farmers markets. Certainly, extensive consultation on the proposals has taken place with all kinds of different stakeholders. The approach to farmers markets is to look at the products that they are selling and think about the different risks and problems that might arise, whether to do with temperature, storage, sanitation, who touches the products and so on. The approach is to identify the different risks and what the effect might be on food safety, rather than starting with the different prescriptive requirements that need to be put in place. That is a shift in approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the shift may not be entirely reflected at this stage, because various prescriptions will remain in force. Some should remain in force but, over time, others will be removed, in addition to those that have already been removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of European Union Documents No. 10427/00, four draft Council Regulations and a draft Council Directive relating to food hygiene, and No. 15475/01, Commission Communication withdrawing one of the draft Council Regulations relating to food hygiene, and supports the Government's aim of securing effective, proportionate legislation throughout the food chain to protect public health in relation to food.—	<i>[Yvette Cooper.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good question session, but I would like to make just a few points at this stage. All the parties represented in the Committee have supported the idea of consolidation and simplification and have welcomed the emphasis on the whole food chain and the flexibility that HACCP provides. To emphasise the importance of the issue, it is clear from Department of Health figures that about 1.7 million cases of food poisoning lead to infectious intestinal disease each year, and about 580 people in the United Kingdom die each year from food poisoning. The issue is important and, if we could get Europe-wide standards and international agreement to improve food safety, we could save the lives of UK citizens.

It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary were to give an overview of where European legislation on the matter was going. How do the regulations interrelate with the general food law? Are they part of it,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
subsidiary to it or separate from it? Perhaps she could clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In annexe E to the regulatory impact assessment, there is mention of the need for further research, particularly into the extent to which retailers are using HACCP. Can the Under-Secretary tell us what research the Department and the Food Standards Agency will be undertaking into the current use of HACCP? Are there plans for further research into the effect on small businesses of associated costs and documentation? It is not clear how much documentation will be required and what its nature will be, or what the costs will be. I have seen the taskforce evidence and the University of Wales study, but they do not present a very clear picture. I would have thought that the small business case was an important one for the Government and that, in developing their negotiating position, they would want to be clear as to the effect of the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of consistency of regulation and implementation, does the Under-Secretary accept that there should be negotiation in Europe on the guides? The Food and Drink Federation point out the danger that separate national guides could lead to non-tariff barriers to trade in the EU. Clearly, that would be damaging to British interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the various derogations are concerned, as the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said, there is a case that we should be able to eat decent cheese, and traditional products made in a traditional way. At the same time, if there are too many areas where it is possible to derogate—small and medium-sized enterprises, mountainous areas, areas that have particular regional flavours and so on—a country such as the UK, which has large producers and very good overall hygiene standards, could be disadvantaged. Other countries might claim that almost every producer was either a small or medium-sized enterprise up a mountain, or has some regional flavour to it. If the Under-Secretary can give us any more assurance about that, it would be most helpful. It would be interesting if she contrasted the derogations that are set out in the first proposal on food production with those in the second proposal on hygiene for food of animal origin, which seem slightly different. There seems to be a wider category for the first proposal than for the second.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of emphasis for safe food from the enforcement authorities to the food producer leads to a concern expressed in the FSA consultation by consumers that such a move could lead to a reduction in the responsibility of the enforcement authorities, and the effectiveness with which they enforce food safety standards. Does the Under-Secretary share that concern? What will the Government do to ensure that that does not happen? Does she agree that it should not be an excuse for less enforcement in other countries? It is very easy for a regime that does not have many enforcement authorities to heave a sigh of relief when new regulations referring to flexibility come in and say, "Oh well, we are being flexible". As a country, we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
always supported the idea that there should be a level playing field and equally rigorous enforcement throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The food industry has raised concerns that small businesses will have an excessive amount of documentation and so on. I think that I have covered that point. What evidence is there that small retailers are familiar with the principles of HACCP? I mentioned research; will the Under-Secretary tell us where we are on that at the moment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have expressed concern about the resource implications. They are very supportive of the general idea. Will she tell us what will happen concerning the cost of training personnel to audit HACCP systems? Does she believe that there are substantial costs? What about the cost of time that will be spent advising premises owners and businesses on the new procedures? Will that require extra resourcing for councils? Are they right to be worried about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as primary producers are concerned, I have asked how the inter-relationship with imported meat will work. Will the Under-Secretary give us some more information on which quality assurance schemes already present in the United Kingdom will qualify as HACCP-compliant? Will there be a whole load of new burdens on farmers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate. We all agree on where we are going, but it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could assure us that the position will be more fully researched and that the Government will stand up for British interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This could be the first time that I have spoken in a debate where the tabloid headline will read, "Euro regs to cut UK rules". I hope that is a correct interpretation. Though I suspect if that is left to some editors, it will read "Europe to cut UK"; not that I am cynical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Tim Lang of Thames Valley university recently gave an interesting perspective when he said that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the British people rioted over the quality of food, food availability and the market system. I doubt that people will riot over the regulations, but there is good reason why some sectors are close to riot over some regulations currently imposed. I shall return to bivalve molluscs in a minute.

It is important that, in training, the old-fashioned commonsense approach should prevail, and I hope that that is taken into education too. My wife and I both love cooking, but my wife hates our kitchen at home because it is not quite finished yet. Bits of plaster are broken, the tiling is not quite done and the surfaces are not quite sealed. However, we apply old-fashioned commonsense—hot water and bleach—and I do not think that we have poisoned anyone yet, although I shall keep my fingers crossed and touch wood, because we have dinner guests in a couple of nights' time. It is that sort of commonsense approach that is required, not a formulaic one that says, "You shall tile walls to full height and hermetically seal your kitchen to

produce good food." It is what one does that counts, not what is around one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On deregulation, I disagree with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). I would rather see lots of deregulation, especially because my understanding is that we are all in favour of local produce. The way to improve local produce is to help, and relax regulations on, very small producers. I am committed, as is my party, to ensuring that the regulations and red tape imposed are cut and that life is made easier for people to get started and make a profit. Certainly, we should make life easier, rather than harder, for those who wish to diversify, especially in the farming sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point, however, that if deregulation meant that a big factory were deregulated because it were on top of a mountain, that would take us down the garden path rather than up a mountain path. We would have to resist that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with the hon.

I hope that he agrees with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am all for a level playing field for those competing on the same football pitch—apart from those who used to play at Yeovil, which had a steep slope—but the import is that the very small people are not playing on the same football pitch. They are competing on a local level, not trying to take on the big food manufacturers. We can give them as much help and assistance as possible without undermining or upsetting the big players. I want to see more competition and more people coming into the market, rather than help for those who already have a near-monopoly in some sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Still on the subject of common sense, I return to the regulations on bivalve molluscs. If we have national regulations, as we currently do on bivalves, the interpretation of them puts the UK at a disadvantage. I hope that the Under-Secretary will resist, at every opportunity, allowing those doors to open. Several people have come to me, on a regular basis, saying that they have been disadvantaged by that interpretation. That is one particular sector, but other sectors suffer equally badly because of such regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) has mentioned meat imports. That subject is very important and is a matter of enforcement; if we are to have new regulations that create a level playing field in the EU, they must be adequately enforced. The UK farming industry is suffering because of meat imports, including poor-quality imports. I hope that the Under-Secretary will ensure that adequate monies are put into enforcement and that we have the people at the ports to carry out inspections. The numbers of such people has been cut, year on year on year, for the past 10 or 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
to reinforce what various Members have already said. On the whole, we welcome the proposals. We have heard that 4.5 million people a year suffer from food-borne disease, more than 750,000 of whom have to consult their doctor, and that there are 50 to 60 deaths from food poisoning each year. That costs the national health service an additional £350 million a year. That is money that we want to try to save, at a time when we want to see as much money as possible going into the NHS, as long as it is well spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a point that we are missing on the preparation of food, although it might not be a subject for this morning. It is a great pity that we are not re-introducing the teaching of food preparation in secondary schools. Many people leaving school have absolutely no idea at all of how to prepare a wholesome meal, which can lead to complications in later years, not least in terms of personal hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that there is no mention in the proposal of the preparation and monitoring of airline food. Airlines bring food from all over the world and perhaps some of the less good airlines reheat unused food, which is taken off to another country, not always in a controlled environment. Several people have suffered after eating airline food. I would like that subject addressed in any future debate on this topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed additional problems and costs for the farming community, something dear to my heart. Although I totally support the farm-to-fork principle, I think it worth spending some time addressing what we, in turn, are trying to encourage farmers and small producers to do; to diversify and to think of new ways of bringing products to the market, for example through farm shops and farm markets. Can the Under-Secretary tell us how she thinks farm markets, for example, can be properly monitored, given that they have what amount to basic stallholders? If one stallholder does not come up to the required standards, how does that affect the farm market as a whole?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are nervous about additional red tape. We have heard nothing about food prepared to meet religious demands. In short, I am keen on the consistency of regulation and implementation. There is no doubt that there is still a feeling that there is one rule for them and one for us. If the proposal goes any way towards mitigating that feeling, it will be of tremendous benefit to all involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, perhaps, a different culture on the European mainland in terms of the presentation of food for sale. We are moving towards that through farm markets, although we have some way to go. Some time ago, I was talking to a butcher in Exmouth who was complaining about the hygiene standards that he had to meet in his shop, the regular inspection and the cleanliness of his tiles. He was comparing that to butchers in France, where he had just been, whose meat is on the pavement but who, although traffic goes up and down emitting noxious substances, seem to be unregulated, so far as he could see. We have some way to go in overcoming the suspicion that there is still, in a real sense, one rule for them and one for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
We have talked about meat production in this country and the trade in illegal meat. The different standards of meat are a very real problem. I am worried that the excellent document on the subject really refers to the importation of products of animal origin from third countries. It mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"the hygiene conditions of production, manufacture, handling, storage and dispatch actually applied to products of animal origin destined for the Community".</p></blockquote>
It talks about the
	<br><blockquote><p>"assurances which the third country can give regarding compliance or equivalence with the relevant health conditions",</p></blockquote>
and refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"experience of marketing of the product from the third country".</p></blockquote>
That is all fine if we are talking about regulated mass importation, but often we are not. We are talking about the personal importation of meat, which could contaminate the food chain. Who is to say that that has not happened in the past? I worry that we are still not doing enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite remarkable that when one goes abroad, particularly to America, there is a big list, and one is quizzed on what one is and is not allowed to bring into the country. In the UK, there is no one to say what one can and cannot bring in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; that is a good point, which warrants further debate. Some years ago when we were not perhaps as aware of these things as we are now, I was given some biltong—dried meat from South Africa—as a gift, which just came through into this country in somebody's luggage. I fear that more exotic substances may now be coming in; we have heard of dried monkeys being brought in from the African continent. That poses a health hazard and could contaminate the food chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I largely support the document, but I seek further reassurance from the Under-Secretary that, as regards the personal illegal importation of meat products, more will be done to check baggage particularly from countries where we suspect such products to originate—to enforce fines and to create a deterrent to stop the products from entering the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) about illegal meat imports. When we deal with food safety issues, we must consider those areas that are transgressing the most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of manufacturers and retailers in this country produce products of high standards, and market them to a high level. The problem largely lies with the illegal import of meat. Recently, we have seen products on the streets of London being dished out from the back of transit vans. That poses a real hazard, particularly to those who are most vulnerable. We have heard reference to deaths by food poisoning; they probably represent the tip of the iceberg, in that the vast majority of food poisoning episodes are never reflected in the available data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Hysterical remarks have appeared in parts of the excitable press about a plethora of epidemics, from ebola to yellow fever, resulting from illegal meat imports. The people who write them probably have a flimsy grip of epidemiology. However, a more reputable source, Professor Joe Brownlie, a pathologist at the Royal Veterinary College, believes that illegal imports pose a grave risk. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We don't know what, if any, viruses this meat contains. It could be foot-and-mouth or it could even be some human virus like tuberculosis."</p></blockquote>
That is a slightly more realistic assessment of the threat posed by the products. The overwhelming problem is posed to individual, not public, health. Generally, we are talking about low levels of illness, but a lot of it nevertheless. I should like the Under-Secretary to focus on that because it needs to be addressed more than the directives under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with the directive, I should like to emphasise a few points, most of which have probably been made already. My constituency is a rural place with many small towns and few large outlets for food. It predominantly has small outlets, such as farmers markets and stalls in ordinary markets, which peddle food at a low volume. They are what one might call traditional-reinvented, and have sprung up in recent months and years. My concern is that they may not be defined as traditional in the way in which a French market that has existed for hundreds of years would be—even though they are selling traditional goods made in a traditional way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question to the Under-Secretary regarding the definition of traditional products was driving at that point. I would be grateful if she would bear in mind that we need to define "traditional" in a way that will not disadvantage small traders, particularly those at the farmers markets that have sprung up relatively recently but can properly be defined as traditional, like some of the outlets on the continent to which my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain concerned about the differential legal costs that might result from the directive, particularly the costs that might be borne by small outlets relative to larger outlets such as Tesco, Asda and all the rest. There is no doubt that the regulatory burden falls more heavily on smaller outfits and has a greater effect on their viability. My concern is that farmers markets, for example, might find themselves at a disadvantage with respect to larger outlets. We might have before us a set of regulations that favour the interests of the larger rather than the smaller retailer, and I think that everyone in the Committee would find that regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have touched on the third proposal. In a sense, it is probably wrong to be debating a proposal that is being withdrawn, but I am concerned that we should focus on re-establishing a level playing field. There is widespread concern in this country that there is no such level playing field at present, particularly for the inspection of abattoirs. I suggest to the Under-Secretary that this is a good opportunity to try to re-establish the competitive basis of the food industry in this country.

In summary, I broadly welcome the proposals and hope that the Minister will take up the opportunities that they offer. I feel strongly that further work needs to be done to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises do not suffer in comparison with their large competitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Yvette Cooper)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These important deliberations have underlined the importance of food hygiene legislation, the importance of promoting public safety, public health and food safety, and the need to modernise and, where possible, simplify our approach. I shall respond to the points made by hon. Members in no particular order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beginning with the overall context of the regulations, the general food law sets out principles, including the prohibition against putting unsafe food on the market. The proposals fit within that approach and specify how food businesses should operate. They consolidate many existing regulations and directives and attempt to simplify and modernise the process in line with increased technology and different approaches to food production. I understand that the definitions in the hygiene proposal require some amendment to bring them in line as far as possible with those in the general food law and that there will be a need to repeal domestic legislation that currently implements the EU legislation that is being replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Members referred to derogations and the double-edged sword of flexibility. The negotiations have acknowledged that derogations should not proliferate or be allowed to undermine food hygiene. We will be working to put in place a mechanism that requires any derogation to be assessed by all member states and approved by the Commission. There should not be blanket derogations but consideration on a case-by-case basis. In that respect, much work has already been done. Certainly, all member states should be informed of any proposed exemption to allow for proper consideration of the justification. I am very alive to the concerns that have been raised by Members on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several issues were raised about farmers markets and so on. Those are not specifically covered by the proposals; markets are currently covered under the general food hygiene directives. Issues were raised about traditional products and derogation. We need to be clear that we are not condoning inappropriate practice. It may have been traditional to make meat pies in a shed, but that may have been be extremely unhygienic and bad in terms of food safety. There will need to be further agreement and pinning down of what that means so that foods given a unique characteristic by their production processes can flourish, provided that the procedures cover hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) asked about products where there may already be some inherent risk, such as cheeses. Raw cheeses are currently closely legislated for, and are covered by the current dairy hygiene directive. The consolidation proposal will not change that situation. Any case to ban raw milk cheeses in the EU would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
have to be pursued under the provisions of the treaty of Rome. Any plans for a wider ban would have to accord with the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions of the world trade agreement. In both cases, that would be likely to mean that the notion that raw milk cheeses presented an unacceptable risk to public health would have to be substantiated and accepted within the terms of the treaty and the agreement. There are several hurdles that that would have to get over, so it seems unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked about whether the best practice guides might be potential barriers to trade. The guides do not supplement the law. The FSA are aware of the Food and Drink Federation's concerns about them. Any guides must be drawn up by the industry together with the enforcers and other stakeholders. That mirrors the current position on guides to best practice; that there should be member state guides and community guides. I understand that there have been various attempts that have not yet been successful in agreeing on a Community guide in any sector, even for those that are relatively standardised in the EU, such as confectionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary amplify on why that might be? Is it because some countries are trying to use the rules in a way that is different from us? Why could the EU not reach agreement on something as simple as a bit of guidance on sweet sales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be clear that there is a difference between the guides to best practice and the legal framework. What is important is that the legal framework—what is set down in the regulations—provides a common standard that is applied throughout the Community. That is why there has been support from the Government for consolidating in that area, and for simplifying the framework. It does mean that we still do not have agreement on the guides to best practice, but by having the regulatory framework in place, we are still making substantial progress. That provides the bottom line, even where it has not been possible to secure further agreement on some of the detail of best practice in terms of implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary agree that if there is not to be EU-wide guidance, a meat shop in Exeter should not be able to cite examples in the rest of Europe when arguing with an environmental health officer about what it should do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds to me that that might well become part of the discussions that would take place at a local level between the enforcement officer and that business if that business were aware of different practices taking place in other parts of the EU. The bottom line is about meeting regulations in terms of risk, and deciding what constitutes a risk to food production and public safety. Whatever the niceties of the modern equivalent of the size of the walls, in the end the point about the HACCP proposals is, "What are the risks?" That debate will take place between an enforcement officer and a business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

up to the highest possible standard across the whole European Union? Would it not therefore be ridiculous to talk about lowering standards, which in this country are among the highest anywhere in Europe, to the level of an abattoir in Greece? It is nonsensical to suggest that a shopkeeper would say, "Please can we have dirty meat because they have got it in Greece?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. The bottom line is food safety. As part of the negotiations, we are also trying to get a level playing field on which to promote UK interests and UK producers. We have to ensure good food safety for UK consumers, whether food comes from this country, Europe or anywhere in the world. All kinds of local discussions may take place about what constitutes risk, the different ways in which other countries avoid risk or which new technologies can be brought to bear. In the end, the question is what is the risk. If there is a risk to consumers from a certain kind of production, it should not be taking place or changes should be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Risk is a relative term. What might be an acceptable risk through tradition in Greece would not be an acceptable risk in other parts of the European Union. The hon. Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham) made a very good point that the Minister has not quite addressed. If we are setting common standards across the European Union, case law or its equivalent will emerge with the passage of time, and may well be cited in this country as a reason for not prosecuting people whom we would currently regard under our domestic regulations as offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of those concerns are misplaced because we set up a food standards agency in this country in order to provide clear, independent advice that puts the consumer first. It was intended to make it clear to everyone what counts as providing safe food and what counts as promoting public health. The Food Standards Agency has made it clear that introducing the HACCP-based approach will improve food safety in this country. It will improve food safety for consumers in this country who are eating food that comes from Europe and the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties about the HACCP-based approach leading to a diminution of standards in this country are misplaced. It is about raising standards in this country while raising enforceable standards across Europe in order to improve the prevention of harmful or dangerous food reaching the UK market. The FSA's advice is clear. It does not see the approach as a way to unravel the standards in this country. It sees it as a way to prevent food-borne infections and cases of food poisoning in this country by improving the way in which we manage and prevent risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in all the EU negotiations and discussions there are important issues around the single market, and we need to be alive to those variations. We must make sure that UK interests are properly pursued and that we have a level playing field. Nevertheless, the overall aim of the proposals, their consequences for food hygiene and the interests of the UK consumer will be subject to potentially
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
significant improvements. Other research is going on into the proposals' impact on food standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A series of other points, including HACCP documentation for small businesses, has been raised. Our negotiating position is to ensure that we do not have unnecessarily complex systems of documentation, because it ought to be possible to use relatively simple documentation that assesses risk and ensures that the FSA is monitoring the risk and implementing HACCP effectively without that being overly complex and burdensome—and the FSA is looking at that in great detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Businesses have found it difficult to estimate their costs in this area. The FSA is working to improve their assessment of costs, and it has particularly looked at the burdens on small business. Examples of things that came up in the consultation include the fact that the cost to a small restaurant with an owner and 11 staff would be about 0.5 per cent. of net turnover. In the case of a small independent supermarket, the cost would be in the region of 0.9 per cent. of net turnover per year. That will obviously vary widely from one kind of business to another and according to what such businesses are already doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulatory impact assessment seems to say that much of the cost would be the start-up cost. Likely costs will therefore depend on what sort of documentation will be required. Although there is a kind of circularity to that, does the Minister agree that further work could be done on the impact of costs and appropriate documentation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. That is exactly the work that the FSA is doing. It is also working on minimising costs—deciding what kinds of documentation and procedures would be simplest in order to achieve the right kinds of results for public health and food hygiene without creating unnecessarily complex situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On hunters and fishermen, the advice that I have received from the FSA is that the reason for the difference in the rules is because there is less public health risk from fish than from mammals and birds. In practice, fewer fish than pheasants and deer caught during leisure pursuits are put on the market. It is important to make it clear that the issue is about game that reaches the market, and not about game for domestic consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the risk of food poisoning or sudden death from eating a fish product is rather less than the risk from eating meat. Concerns have, however, recently been raised about the effects of North sea toxins, for example, in fish and hormone levels in, for example, salmon. In other words, there are potentially undiscovered public health risks. It would be unwise to assume that public health risks will not emerge in the future, and we need to make contingency plans for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that we need to be alive to the kinds of public health risks that may arise, and ensure that the system is sufficiently responsive. We shall certainly look at that further as part of the discussions before the negotiations.

Reference was made earlier to the assured chicken scheme and other quality assurance schemes. Assured schemes are marketing schemes. Imports must therefore meet the equivalent hygiene standard to that which will be enforced by the Food and Veterinary Office. The role of the assured schemes is to promote confidence in aspects of UK produce, and I am advised that the FSA will be working with primary producers on that. Where assurance schemes already give the necessary guidance on how best to control hazards, the approach will not be to try to invent such guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister probably knows, an assured scheme often involves a farmer reaching an agreement with a supermarket to produce products in a particular way, which means that many records have to be kept. Does she accept that a requirement to keep a separate set of records for HACCP purposes could be very burdensome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point in re-inventing something that is already doing the risk-management job that is required. The FSA would look closely at how one implements it in practice and what sort of documentation is needed. We should use existing schemes if they work. The approach of simplification, where it promotes public health, is obviously better.

I understand that revised proposal 3 is expected sometime in May or June. On the issues around registration and preservability mentioned earlier, I understand that general food law provides for food businesses to withdraw food that they find to be unfit. Additionally, competent authorities are empowered to withdraw food and take necessary action. The current proposals do not change that situation. An example of legislation or controls that would be struck down by the proposals is the present requirement to sterilise equipment with water at 82 deg. The new approach would allow other means of disinfection rather than specifying one particular method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still not clear on the implications for natural health products or foods. Natural health foods are covered by the Food Safety Act 1990 and the proposals, as is any food. They already have to meet food safety requirements, but it is not clear how the proposals would constrain the operation of natural health food businesses. Obviously, such businesses will have to address food safety risks so that they produce safe products in the same way that everyone else does.

My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) referred to issues about information. I am not sure of the effects of the proposals, but I think that I can reassure him. The proposals will apply to catering on ships, aircraft and trains. The UK Government pushed for it to be made entirely clear in the legislation that such food is covered.

As I said earlier, DEFRA is reviewing meat import controls. It is important to be clear that this is not simply about the legal framework but about the practicalities of implementation and enforcement. Given the scale of food imports and the different routes by which products can enter the country—the hon. Member for East Devon mentioned the example of something that arrives in someone's suitcase—we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
need to assess the practicalities. DEFRA is considering what more needs to and can be done, but we must also recognise that protecting the human food chain is not simply about checking imports. It is also necessary for farmers to adopt stricter biosecurity measures to increase hygiene and prevent the introduction of disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that while the investigation into illegally imported meat is continuing, the precautionary measure suggested by the hon. Member for Teignbridge should be adopted? At the least, we could have something at the airports, as in the United States, clearly identifying what one is allowed to bring in. That purely preventative measure would not need a great deal of consultation but is just common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pass on the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. Actually, providing consistent information at airports cannot be done at the drop of a hat, but his suggestion should certainly be passed to DEFRA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is not the sort of thing that can be done at the drop of a hat, but the very sensible suggestion of the hon. Member for Teignbridge and my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon can be carried out at minimal cost and very quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I shall certainly pass to DEFRA the points about providing people with information. However, the Department is very alive to the issue as a result of foot and mouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tony Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for information, I spoke on the Animal Health Bill debate and raised those issues. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Morley) said that DEFRA would take them on board and seriously consider making posters, leaflets and all sorts of things available at airports so that people understood what they could and could not bring into the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Yvette Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that clarification. DEFRA is concerned about what more can be done at every stage of the process to prevent contamination of the food chain, and to prevent things such foot and mouth, which caused British agriculture so many problems.

One hon. Member raised the issue of resource implications for enforcement and training. The FSA provides resources for the training of environmental health officers and is doing so to support the implementation of HACCP by small and medium enterprises. It is worth noting that where they have introduced the HACCP approach following the general food hygiene directive, local authorities have reported an improvement in the relationship between businesses and the local authorities that deal with enforcement issues. A constructive approach based around risk, rather than around elements of prescription that do not seem relevant to the production process, is a welcome step forward for both businesses and enforcement officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate and it is clear that there is broad support for the overall direction of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
proposals. Clearly, details must be pinned down in discussions at European level and in implementation. In the end, the proposals are about promoting public health and food safety, about introducing a system in which, as evidence has shown, it is better to prevent risk from food-borne disease and food poisoning, and about protecting consumers. Public safety is the priority and must be the bottom line in negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also be alive to issues that relate to a level playing field and promoting UK interest. We must ensure that we introduce sensible regulations, and a system that is more efficient and responsive to the needs of businesses and operators, and that promotes consumer choice. In discussion so far, the FSA has been alive to all those factors. The UK Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
are also concerned about them and will take them up during every stage of negotiations in the Council. They will be important steps forward, and it will come as a great reassurance to British consumers that their interests in food safety are being properly promoted here and in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
