	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Aircraft Noise</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call the Minister to make his opening statement, which I hope will not last in excess of 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (Mr. David Jamieson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cran, for that welcome. It is a pleasure to be a member of a Committee under your chairmanship. I have not had the pleasure before, but I look forward to many repeat occasions. I shall, of course, observe your instruction: I shall make my opening statement brief but precise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals before us are important for dealing with aircraft noise. The first, the Commission's proposal for replacing the European Union hushkits regulation, is the more pressing. The second is for a common classification of aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges at airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hushkits regulation, as the Committee will be aware, has been the subject of a long-running dispute between the United States and the EU. In October, all 187 member states of the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed a new environmental resolution covering among other things the management of aircraft noise. The European Union and the United States agreed subsequently that that resolution should form the basis for resolving their dispute. The directive is the proposal for formalising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has before it explanatory memorandum 15014/01, which was submitted by the Minister for Transport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), on 17 January 2002, and the European Scrutiny Committee's report dated 6 March 2002. We agree that the EU hushkits regulation should be repealed, but do not want to exchange one problem for another. It is important that what replaces it helps us—not hinders us—to manage aircraft noise. The US has an interest but that, of course, is not the only consideration. New arrangements need to be suitable for the UK's circumstances. So, we need to get this right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that end, a series of detailed discussions has taken place in Brussels in recent weeks. The European Parliament voted on 13 March to accept the compromise amendments with two small but significant modifications. First, article 3 now allows for more than one competent authority to be responsible for matters falling within the scope of the directive. Secondly, article 5(i) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"When a decision on operating restrictions is being considered the information as specified in Annex 2"—</p></blockquote>
here is the difference—
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, as far as appropriate and possible for the operating restrictions concerned and for the characteristics of the airport, be taken into account".</p></blockquote>
The Transport Council will be invited to decide on 26 March whether the compromise is acceptable. I appreciate that matters have been complicated by the fact that amendments have been coming at us thick and fast, but the revised version has been made available, and I hope that all hon. Members have availed themselves of copies from the Vote Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scrutiny Committee's report also covers the more straightforward proposal on classifying aircraft for noise charging purposes, on which subject explanatory memorandum 5119/02 was submitted by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport on 6 February 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to debate the matter, as I entirely share the Committee's view that aircraft noise is a serious concern for people who live around our major airports, especially those in the south-east of England. I shall be pleased to respond to as many questions as appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.40 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. I do not think that there will be any difficulty in fitting all the questions into the time available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Cran. As a regular member of the Committee, I know that we have a variety of Chairmen. I am sure that you will enjoy the crisp way in which we will try to expedite today's business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residents were successful in the recent court judgment on night flying at Heathrow. How will that judgment link to the documents that we are considering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want to open a debate on the Hatton judgment, as it would be improper to attempt to do so today. If Heathrow or any other airport decided to invoke the directive and use it for environmental controls, it would have to consider any judgment or plan that pertained to it. The directive puts a common methodology in place in airports across the European Union. In using it, any judgments will have to be considered. Only time will tell the final outcome in any circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chapter 3 mentions newer types of subsonic aircraft, which is the quietest jet aircraft in service. They include the Boeing 757 and the Airbus 320. What cognisance has been taken in drawing up the plans of technological developments, given that we might have sub-subsonic airlines in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The plans deal with whatever noise aircraft make. My hon. Friend will appreciate that most aircraft in service and under construction comply with chapter 3, and already many even comply with chapter 4. The noise output is under specific consideration, rather than the type of aircraft. We are considering subsonic and supersonic aircraft, but essentially they fall into the one category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship yet again, Mr. Cran. There must be a European connection, as I understand you have other responsibilities in that direction. The two seem to go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister's forgiveness if he confirmed the date in his opening remarks, but am I right to think that the directives come into force on 1 April? Was that the original time scale for the arrangement, or have minds been concentrated as a result of the events of 11 September?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that the events of 11 September have had any bearing on the proposals. They have come about due to the action taken by the United States through ICAO and its environmental resolution, and in consideration of article 84 of the Chicago convention. That has driven the directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will note that annex 3 to section B of the documents lists marginally compliant aircraft from developing countries by geographical region. Does the EU intend, through technological or other assistance, aid or subsidy, to help operators in those countries to improve the performance or quality of the engines in those aircraft?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would obviously benefit world trade and prevent the creation of a monopoly of north American and European operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that sensible question. The European Union has taken cognisance of the special circumstances in many developing countries, and we are doing everything that we can to assist. The directive includes a special dispensation for developing countries. There is a 10-year limit on any exemption, and any service will have had to have operated in the five years preceding 31 December 2001.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Cran.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of the Council of Europe and have travelled to various European capitals. As whether an airport is close to a city, such as Barajas in Madrid, or further away from it is merely the result of historical accident, one might expect there to be some flexibility in determining noise restrictions. Will the Minister tell us what flexibility there is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question. We were aware that some flexibility would be necessary for the reasons that he outlined. Not all aspects of the balanced approach proposed by ICAO would suit every country or airport. For example, one of the elements of the balanced approach is that planning matters may be taken into consideration, but as the surrounding areas of most airports in this country are fully developed, it is unlikely that we will get much advantage from that measure. However, it is possible for an airport to give weight to just some of the four elements of the balanced approach in using the provisions to set environmental objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What consultations has my hon. Friend had with British aircraft and airport operators, in particular with BAA? If he has consulted those
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
bodies on the documents before the Committee, what were their responses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will not be surprised to know that there have been widespread discussions on the directives and there is widespread approval of the document as it stands today, because it has been evolving even during the past few weeks. All the organisations that my hon. Friend mentioned were consulted, particularly two airlines—one that runs a small freight line and another that runs a small passenger line—as they may fall into the 5 dB band that may not be compliant in the 10 large airports. However, those discussions will be ongoing, and should an airport decide to use the measures in the directive to set environmental objectives, airlines and other users would have to be consulted further as part of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Cran. I apologise for being late. I was diverted by a constituency problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What interrelationship is there between noise pollution, which is the subject of the documents before us, and other kinds of environmental pollution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that question. The first directive deals with what airports can do to handle noise, while the second deals with the methodology for calibrating noise from particular aircraft. Neither covers other aspects of environmental pollution, although the European Union is consulting on some of those and will probably introduce measures in the not-too-distant future. The directives, however, deal with noise pollution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do any airports in the UK intend to introduce noise charging?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that is already built into the charging formula that some of them use. Indeed, I believe that the major London airports already use charging. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we are not too happy about the second directive; we have several reservations and want changes to be made to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that the view in the industry and among aviation engineers is that the problems addressed by the documents have more to do with annoyance to neighbours and the general operation of airports. Have my hon. Friend and EU officials considered the health and safety aspects of aircraft noise as it affects not only ground crew but all those who work in airports, as well as the communities that live in close proximity to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. Although the directives do not deal with those matters, they arise from general concerns about how to reduce noise at airports. He will know that, regardless of the directives, we are concerned about the effect on people of noise in the workplace. That is, of course, a matter for the relevant health and safety legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many airports have regular discussions with stakeholders such as local councils and local residents, and several such discussions are currently under way, with those involved trying to strike
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
voluntary agreements to reduce the annoyance and noise generated by certain airports. It is no secret that discussions to strike a strong voluntary agreement are under way at East Midlands airport, and many other airports already have such agreements. Special studies are being carried out—for example, into the possible effects of noise on schoolchildren. It is important that we examine such studies, although I am not aware that they have produced any evidence that would cause us concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to raise those issues. The directives take account of the general concern, and when they are implemented their impact on some of the issues will be considered. We need the flexibility that my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) mentioned, because we must find local solutions to local problems—there is no blanket solution to all the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tom Brake 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Cran. I, too, apologise for arriving a couple of seconds after the Minister started his opening statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did UK representatives make representations about using the proposals as a means to place a ceiling on noise? Would the Government support such a move?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In theory, the directive could be used in that way; it is very flexible. It would be up to one of the 10 UK airports that are affected, each of which would have an environmental objective. The hon. Gentleman asks about airport noise ceilings. Such a ceiling might apply to the maximum noise from one aircraft at any one moment, as the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) suggested, or to the profile of noise throughout the day. It is possible that an airport, in meeting its environmental objectives, would use such a measure as one of a variety of tools. It could also use air traffic control, or focus on the way in which the aircraft are brought in and out of the airport, or on the times of day at which flights take place. A raft of measures could be used, not only one tool. What is important is that the directive makes a common methodology available to airports throughout the European Union, gives airlines more knowledge, and encourages transparency of decision making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documents are all about noise and the protection of people who live close to airports and are affected by it. Might they also be about aircraft technology and whether such information from Europe can affect the replacement of old, noisy aircraft, which might prove to be a boost to aircraft manufacturers? I know that that is an unkind question. If my hon. Friend prefers to write to me, I shall agree to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not tempted to write to my hon. Friend, but I might express a view in the privacy of the Committee. Some older, noisy aircraft have been phased out because noise standards have gradually been raised—to the benefit of all the countries of Europe, including the UK. The technology is evolving
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
in part because of the pressure that we put on aircraft manufacturers to improve their noise standards. The introduction of directives and the imposition of target dates for noise reduction might result in new aircraft having to be built, but my sole consideration is the benefits for the people of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister believe that people campaigning against noise pollution, such as those concerned about Heathrow airport, will have their case strengthened or weakened by the directives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that they will have their case somewhat changed. A balanced approach allows for many ways of considering noise. If I were a local campaigner, I would see that circumstances had changed but that the ability of local people to be involved in the process was not reduced. The methodology states that local consultation is important and must take place; the change in the way in which it takes place will not change its effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that some people—not least Government Members— expect the Government to start thinking about a strategy on aviation policy covering the next decade or so. If such consideration is taking place in the Department, will the EU proposals fundamentally affect any policy that we might instinctively have adopted as a single nation, rather than as part of the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that we will soon put out to consultation the regional studies for our airports. The results will emerge some time in spring; they will inform the White Paper, which is to be published before the end of the year. The directive might not change our thinking, but it will influence the contents of the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister expand on the comments made in the explanatory memorandum on noise charging? I understand that the ICAO has in place standards and rules relating to classification of aircraft noise. Given that all European Union members subscribe to those rules, why does the EU feel it necessary to introduce a directive on the subject?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive does not introduce a Europe-wide charge but gives a methodology for calculating the charge. The hon. Gentleman will know from the explanatory memorandum that we have many reservations about the directive, and I hope that he will support us in seeking changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, we have discussed fixed-wing aircraft, but helicopters pose their own special problems, in part because the rotary wing breaks the sound barrier at its tip and makes an exceptionally annoying noise as it does so. The nature of helicopters is such that they can be landed much closer to occupied premises. Will the Minister explain the position regarding helicopters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not have served on a previous Committee, which was also attended by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), in which we discussed a statutory instrument relating to noise made by helicopters in construction and in use at airports. If

an airport uses the directives to inform its environmental objectives, the total profile of noise from all subsonic aircraft will be taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the environmental standards order provides more stringent requirements, especially for light helicopters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There being no further questions, we may now move to debate the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union document No. 15014/01, draft Directive on the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community Airports and No. 5119/02, draft Directive on the establishment of a Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges; and supports the Government position to ensure that the proposed Directives allow the development of a coherent and balanced approach to managing noise nuisances at UK airports consistent with existing ICAO rules and standards.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief. We welcome the directives in that they represent a climbdown from the stringent proposals made some time ago. The events of 11 September have some bearing, as many operating aircraft companies are struggling mightily to stay in business after the massive fall-off in the number of people travelling by air. The possibility of being burdened with the additional costs of upgrading their aircraft to meet stringent requirements on noise must have caused them concern. We welcome the fact that common sense has prevailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new proposals, the onus of responsibility is thrown on to individual airports and communities. The Minister gave a pretty clever response to my question about local campaigners, but he did not answer it. I suspect that those who have campaigned against aircraft noise for many years because it impinges on their lives will find that the directives do not help them to press their case for fundamental change to alleviate the problem and give them a better quality of life. The directives say that there will local representation, input and consultation—wonderful words, but where is the power to change things? It is not present. Even Members of Parliament for constituencies where people are constantly lobbying about aircraft noise will have no more influence than before. Nothing in the proposals helps us to make a case on behalf of those who are affected by noise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review is balanced, covering on the one hand the interests of those whose lifestyles are affected, and on the other our desire to keep as many companies as possible flying, not only for the sake of competition but because thousands of jobs at many levels around the world are at stake. On balance we welcome the European Union's change of heart about the directives. We would like to think—no doubt, the Minister will confirm this—that he or his colleagues had a massive influence on the outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tom Brake</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. I have not previously attended a European Standing Committee. I know that as I am not formally a member of the Committee I cannot vote, but may I say something on behalf of the Liberal Democrats?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tom Brake</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cran. I simply want to say that we support the directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare a sort of interest, as a former pilot. Before I was elected to Parliament, my wife and I lived in Richmond, which is on the approach route to Heathrow. I was regarded as something of a freak because my favourite activity was to lie in the garden with a deckchair and a pair of field glasses. I thoroughly enjoy aircraft and I had no qualms about the noise, but I recognise that that attitude is now out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on all of us to be conscious of noise pollution and other forms of pollution, such as light pollution. I recently saw a map of the United Kingdom showing the extent to which light has become a major problem, and darkness something to be sought. I welcome the general thrust of the directives. Although we all have our own views about the manner of Britain's approach to the European Union, it provides a useful forum for discussion of matters such as noise pollution. I join my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) in welcoming the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate, in which some interesting points were made. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and I have something in common—the fact that this is the first time that we have served on a Committee of this type. In a moment of humour, he managed to agree entirely with the proposals—a very rare occurrence. Usually, he has a long string of questions, every one of which I answer assiduously on every occasion. I am delighted that we have both been broken in together today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One concern expressed—quite properly—is that under the directive local groups have to be consulted and have the right to challenge decisions that they consider unreasonable. In one sense, that gives extra strength to local people who might have strong views about the noise from an airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for noise-related operating restrictions, a compromise amendment to the directive is proposed that would leave the United Kingdom free to set environmental policies and targets. That is consistent with our wider international obligations, in particular those enshrined in the ICAO resolution A33–7. It enables local solutions to local problems to be developed—a point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green—and provides for the circumstances of developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first directive would repeal the hushkits regulation and thus remove the source of a dispute that has been running for some time between the European Union and the United States. It also strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of aviation and those who are affected by aircraft noise. I hope that the Committee will agree that the United
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Kingdom should accept the proposed directive with the compromise amendments that are now being offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the directive on the framework for noise charges would benefit from clearer justification; some technical improvement might also be needed. I hope that the Committee will agree that the United Kingdom should pursue those matters constructively with the European Commission and fellow European Union member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
