<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee has recommended our important debate, which will consider two central elements of the European process of economic policy co-ordination: the Commission's recommendation for the 2002 broad economic policy guidelines and the council opinions on the 2001 stability and convergence programmes. The debate will therefore cover a wide range of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Committee for arranging the debate at such short notice and, importantly, for holding it before the Seville European Council on 21 June, at which we expect the broad economic policy guidelines to be agreed and formally adopted. I shall talk first about the broad economic policy guidelines and then the stability and convergence programmes. In accordance with article 99 of the EC treaty, the Commission has published its recommendation for the 2002 broad economic policy guidelines for member states and the European Union. The text is being revised by officials in preparation for discussion by ECOFIN on 20 June, followed by agreement at the Seville European Council on 21 June and, subsequently, formal adoption by ECOFIN.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines form the central part of the process of multilateral surveillance and economic policy coordination in the European Union and build on the other EU processes, including the stability and growth pact, the Cardiff process on structural reform and the Luxembourg process on employment. As I made clear in my explanatory memorandum, the Government have been keen to develop the role of the broad economic policy guidelines. Indeed, we feel that it is essential that the guidelines fully reflect the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness and in promoting employment and social inclusion to improve the performance of the European economies. The Government's recent White Paper on economic reform in Europe highlighted the achievements in implementing structural reform across the EU. However, it also pointed out that we are some way from achieving the full potential that the single market offers to consumers and producers. Increasing the delivery of those benefits can be achieved through positive messages on economic reform in the broad economic policy guidelines, which is why the Government attach such importance to the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's 2002 guidelines focus on macro-economic policies, public finances, medium and long-term implications of structural policies and reforms aimed at promoting economic growth potential,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
employment and social cohesion, as well as on the transition towards a knowledge-based economy and policies for sustainable development. Against that, the Commission highlights four key challenges for European policy: safeguarding and further strengthening the macro-economic framework; promoting more and better jobs, raising labour force participation and addressing persistent unemployment; strengthening conditions for high productivity growth, and promoting sustainable development in the interest of current and future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government share the Commission's emphasis on those policy areas and our policies for achieving them are consistent with the Commission's recommendation for the 2002 guidelines: sound macro-economic policies based on well-managed public finances and low inflation and economic reform, including improvements in the workings of goods and services markets, modernisation of the labour market, better regulation and promotion of entrepreneurship. In its 2002 recommendation, the Commission has drawn significantly on the findings of its implementation report, which it produced in February as a follow-up to the 2001 guidelines. The Government feel that that method of monitoring and reviewing is an important step in consolidating the progress made to date and it should help embed the notion of European economic reform in the minds of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's recommendation for the 2002 guidelines also includes, as in recent years, country-specific recommendations for each member state. The Government welcome the inclusion of country-specific elements in the guidelines, which implicitly acknowledge the fact that different states face different and sometimes unique challenges. The Commission's UK-specific recommendations are in line with the Government's stated policy objectives and with the measures that we have taken since coming into office. The recommendations emphasise the need to maintain sound public finances while increasing investment in public services; to reinforce measures targeted at those prone to the risk of long-term unemployment; to address the relatively low level of productivity in the UK, and to deliver the announced infrastructure investment in railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has recommended a budgetary policy objective for the UK to ensure that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in 2003–04, an outturn for the general government balance can be expected that respects the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact of a budgetary balance that is close to balance or in surplus."</p></blockquote>
The Government believe that the Commission's interpretation of the stability and growth pact is too mechanistic. I have made clear to the Commission our support for a prudent interpretation of that pact, which takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the role of public investment. The Government continue to discuss that point with the Commission and other EU partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the issue of the council opinions on the 2001 stability and convergence programmes, which the Committee recommended should also be debated here today. They outline the council's views of member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
states' budgetary priorities and projections. They are responses to the programmes submitted annually by each member state: EMU members submit stability programmes; non-EMU members submit convergence programmes. Those programmes set out the medium-term budgetary plans of member states. That process of budgetary surveillance provides operational content to the stability and growth pact. The pact's aim is to promote the co-ordination of fiscal policies and to ensure the avoidance of excessive Government deficits, based on articles 99 and 104 of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I noted earlier, the council opinions are one of the items that inform the broad economic policy guidelines, feeding into the budgetary policy recommendations. The Government think that fiscal sustainability is a precondition for macro-economic stability. We agree with the principle of a strong pact founded on sensible fiscal policy co-ordination set out in the treaty. As I said, the Government support a prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact, which takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the important role of public investment. We think that a prudent interpretation would enhance the pact's credibility and strengthen its functioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that the UK's programme was deposited before the 2002 Budget and so does not take into account the measures and updated figures outlined then; instead, it is based on the figures set down in the pre-Budget report. The programmes for 2001 were examined at ECO FIN meetings in January, February and March, following preparation by the Economic and Financial Committee, with the UK programme assessed in February. The UK played a full role throughout the Council discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, this round of economic policy coordination will culminate in the adoption of the 2002 broad economic policy guidelines by ECOFIN in the margins of the European Council in Seville on 21 June. The UK is keen to play a constructive role in encouraging sound and sustainable public finances across the EU and encouraging economic reform, building on the results of the Lisbon special European Council as detailed in the recent White Paper on European economic reform. The Government are also committed to participating fully in this important process of policy coordination. Approving this motion today will allow the UK to achieve all of those goals. I hope that the Committee will support the motion. I look forward to participating in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recommendation to the Commission mentions that member states should facilitate the transferability of social security and pension rights. I am well aware of that: when I was elected and came back from working abroad I had a tax bill of £50,000 because those rights were not transferable. What steps are the Government taking to promote transferability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is aware that one of the founding principles of the EU is the idea of labour mobility. Clearly the transferability of pension and social security rights would facilitate the functioning of the labour market. However, I would not claim that we have reached that point yet. We have been working hard to open up capital markets across the EU, one of which is pensions. We have just reached political agreement on the new pensions directive, which will make it easier for companies to operate cross-border pension schemes. We are moving in that direction although there is clearly a long way to go yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro and St. Austell)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister described the Commission's interpretation of the stability and growth pact as too mechanistic. Perhaps she could comment on the more recent statements from the EU Commission, which suggest a more flexible interpretation than was previously feared, especially in relation to long-term investment and Government borrowing in that respect, which appears to mirror the position that the Government— and Liberal Democrats—argued for more closely than was anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that there is a prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact. Three different elements of that interpretation need to be taken into account, one of which is the state of the economic cycle. It is sensible to take that into account when considering whether the 3 per cent. limit needs to be strictly adhered to in the stability and growth pact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other important elements are the sustainability of public finances and whether the debt ratio of the country concerned is, for example, on a downward or an upward trajectory. Another critical element, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, is whether, as in the case of the United Kingdom, for example, there has been chronic under-investment in public services. When taken together, we argue that the UK needs to interpret those elements in a sensible way and to recognise that it must address that historic under-investment. This country has a sustainable fiscal position and that, too, should be taken into account when interpreting the stability and growth pact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's answers to the previous questions on the stability and growth pact. The statement by the Council on the budgetary situation in Germany suggests that the 3 per cent. will be rigidly adhered to. There has recently been a difference of view between French and German spokespersons about the degree of flexibility allowed in the stability and growth pact. The French suggested that flexibility would be a good thing—I can understand why they would want that to be so—and the Germans said that it should be rigidly adhered to and there should not be any flexibility. Indeed, the words of a German banker were that a flexible stability and growth pact would be a disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps not surprising, as the Germans were the authors of the stability and growth pact, that there will be a divergence of opinion within Germany on the interpretation of the pact, how rigid it should be or how flexibly it should be interpreted. However, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, the issue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
came up for discussion in an earlier ECOFIN meeting this year. The Commission had proposed to the Council that an early-warning letter should be sent to Germany, stating that it was in danger of reaching the 3 per cent. limit laid down in the stability and growth pact. There was a political discussion at ECOFIN on how the pact should be interpreted. It was recognised that Germany had been suffering from the state of the economic cycle and that its debt ratio was on a downward trajectory, and it was therefore decided not to issue the early-warning letter. Clearly, there will be differing views about the interpretation, but the United Kingdom continues to argue that it should be interpreted in a prudent manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures on which the commentary is based for the UK are based on the previous Government's growth projections of 2.25 per cent. Since then, the Government have raised their growth projections. The commentary specifically refers to believing that Governments like to come within their targets, partly because of the cautious estimates on growth. Has there been any response from the Commission or elsewhere in European Union institutions to the Government's decision to raise their growth targets and the effect that that may have on their ability to meet either the conditions of the pact or wider Government objectives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that Heads of Government discuss the broad economic policy guidelines once a year. Those guidelines must be based on figures that are not—let me put it this way—the most up-to-date and accurate available. However, the Treasury stands completely behind this assessment of the trend rate of growth. It is still a conscious interpretation of the trend rate of growth, while recognising different factors such as net migration in the calculation. As far as I am aware, there has been no discussion of that point at European level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's answer to an earlier question about Germany, which suggested that its current difficulties are a feature of the economic cycle. Does she agree that a major problem for Germany is that it pushed the deutschmark into the single currency at too high a level, which is an inherently deflationary factor in its economy? Does she also agree that its situation was aggravated still further by the weakening of the dollar, which is sometimes interpreted as a strengthening of the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of my hon. Friend's views on the euro as, I am sure, are other members of the Committee. I am not going to get into a debate here on the merits or otherwise of the euro. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) also knows, and the Treasury's position makes it clear, that we will have an economic assessment based on all the relevant criteria in due course. However, I agree that the German deficit was made worse by the worsening of the economic situation throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report of the European Scrutiny Committee raised the question of whether the system of warnings was working satisfactorily, given that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Council has not implemented the two suggested warnings for Germany and Portugal, possibly because the Governments concerned made several commitments. Does the Minister think that the system is optimum, or can it be improved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have an effective system, and the UK supports the broad economic guidelines. We also support the stability and convergence programme, which is a component of those guidelines. It is implemented through peer discussion of budgetary policies throughout the European Union and, in certain circumstances, through the issuing of an early warning letter to those member states who risk reaching the 3 per cent. limit. As my hon. Friend points out, that was discussed at length at an ECOFIN meeting earlier this year. In two cases, the Commission proposed that the Council consider whether to send an early warning letter. As members of the Committee are aware, it is up to the Commission to initiate proposals, but decisions on whether the proposals are sensible and should be carried out are taken after a political discussion between member states. Certain commitments were made in the course of such a discussion, in which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor took an active part. Germany and Portugal gave certain assurances, including one that they would reach budgetary balance over the next few years. It was also recognised that their debt ratios were on a downward trajectory. The process works well. This was clearly a highly sensitive and emotive issue in Germany. I am convinced that the process of peer review is important and adds to policy co-ordination at a European level. The fact that no early warning letter was issued to Germany does not undermine the operation of that system in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one more question. Given the current economic difficulties inside the eurozone, particularly for Germany and France, where threats to public spending are on the cards, does my hon. Friend agree that the Chancellor's extreme caution about Britain joining the euro is absolutely right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I are at one. We must take a hard-headed economic look at the issues surrounding the euro and whether it is in Britain's national interest to join, which is what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is committed to doing. We will have that economic assessment within the first two years of this Parliament, and I am sure that we will have a vivid and enjoyable debate when it is published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If no more hon. Members want to ask questions, we shall proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

REV1 and 2002/C 51/06, Council Opinions and Statements on the 2001 Stability and Convergence Programmes; and welcomes these Opinions and Statements as promoting the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation."—[	<i>Ruth Kelly.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bercow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you and good morning, Mr. Hurst, and I welcome you to the Chair. We look forward to you chairing the remainder of our proceedings with a combination of firmness, fairness and humour. I should also like to congratulate the Financial Secretary, as this is my first public opportunity to do so, on her promotion within the Treasury. It is richly deserved, she is a popular figure throughout the House and I wish her well in her new and elevated post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows me only too well. He will therefore know that I shall make a relatively brief speech, in conformity with my usual practice, unless I am provoked to do otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pick up on the Minister's opening statement and pose a series of questions. I understand her comments about the Government's view that the European Commission's stance on the state of public finances is too mechanistic, but she went on to say that discussions with the European Commission would continue. My first point is that I have no objection to discussions taking place with the European Commission if, and only if, there are matters usefully to discuss. On the specific question of whether the UK's budgetary position should be close to balance or in surplus, will the Financial Secretary confirm that the Government's objection to the Commission's stance is such that they will not, under any circumstances or as part of a compromise, agree either to reduce public expenditure or raise taxes simply to fulfil the Commission's wish of bringing the UK budget closer to balance in 2003–04? Will she confirm that such a move will not be entertained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the broad economic guidelines call on member states to take action
	<br><blockquote><p>"to strengthen incentives for people to take up work".</p></blockquote>
How does the Financial Secretary square that position with the Government's decision to increase national insurance contributions? If the Government believe that not raising income tax is designed to reward work, as the Chancellor told the Treasury Committee on 11 December 2001, does she not accept that the logical corollary is that to increase taxation by way of national insurance contributions acts as a disincentive to work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister will know that the guidelines say that during the medium term, macroeconomic policy
	<br><blockquote><p>"should contribute to the establishment of the framework conditions that promote adequate levels of saving and investment".</p></blockquote>
The Treasury projects that the savings ratio will be 3.75 per cent. this year, which is the lowest on record and a mere 40 per cent. of the level that the Government inherited from the Conservative party.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
In the light of that, what plans are there to bolster the savings ratio?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the Financial Secretary will be aware of the guidelines' observation about the need for member states to create a business-friendly environment. She will also be conscious of and, I hope, reasonably concerned about the CBI's verdict on the Budget. Immediately after the Budget, Digby Jones declared:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Business certainly feels very aggrieved. It feels let down. Many of the businesses that have engaged with various initiatives to raise productivity and so on are beginning to say: Is this Government really engaged with the business agenda, or is it reverting to type?'"</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister undertake to assess the total costs of regulation on British businesses and produce a plan for limitations on—or, better still, a reduction of—the burden of regulation on business in the coming years? Can she pledge that the Government's record of introducing one regulation every 26 minutes of the working day will improve in 2002–03?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, the guidelines state that member states should "promote the quality" and enhance the efficiency of public expenditure. Curiously, while endorsing that sentiment, the Government refuse to look with an open mind at lessons that could be learnt from abroad about the provision of public services and about the ways in which countries with different structures and systems from our own are able more effectively to translate care from a word to a deed. The Minister will know that work published by the Office for National Statistics last month showed that productivity in the national health service has fallen under the present Government. What does the Minister propose to do in respect of economic policy to promote the quality and enhance the efficiency of public expenditure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might add a further question under the fifth heading. Are the Government sufficiently concerned about the extent of Departmental underspends that they propose to change the operation of their end-year flexibility rules, the better to avoid excessive underspends given that there is unmet demand in several public services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As sometimes happens when I listen to the hon. Gentleman, I am confused. He asks the Government to refuse to follow certain European Commission recommendations and he points to other recommendations as a hook on which to attach criticisms of the Government. Does he feel that the Government should strive to fulfil all the recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly regard it as an absolute criterion on which to measure the effectiveness of Government economic policy that they adhere to the letter of the guidelines emanating from the European Commission. I am hurt, surprised and taken aback that the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) thinks that I have been unclear. I have been attacked for many reasons over the years and I make no complaint about most of those attacks. As a Member of Parliament, one receives the occasional bouquet, but is accustomed to the receipt of brickbats. However, the brickbat lobbed at me by the hon. Gentleman—that I am guilty of ambiguity and haziness—is as wounding as it is unfair. The answer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
to the hon. Gentleman is no, I do not regard that as a particularly significant yardstick in the conduct of British economic policy. I hope that I have made myself clear. If not, I confidently anticipate that the hon. Gentleman will spring to his feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the burden of regulation and was about to move on to my sixth question, from which I am sure that the hon. Member for Broxtowe would not wish to divert me. The guidelines state that relatively low productivity in the United Kingdom remains a key challenge. As the Chancellor said as long ago as November 1998, productivity is a "fundamental yardstick" of economic performance. On that, I certainly agree with the Government. The difficulty is that their words are different from their deeds. There is a chasm between the Government's rhetoric on the one hand and their performance on the other. The hon. Lady need not depend on me for that point. It is clear from the ONS figures that productivity has grown less quickly under Labour than under the Conservatives, and less quickly than it needs to. Will she say in more specific and concrete terms how the Government intend to translate the ambition of improved productivity into fact?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My seventh question relates to the impact of ageing, a phenomenon with which we should all be concerned, with the possible exception of you, Mr. Hurst. The hon. Lady will be aware that the Barcelona European Council called for an increase of about five years in the effective average retirement age in the European Union by 2010. It was requested that member states should restrict access to early retirement programmes. That is a matter of legitimate public interest and it certainly has an economic and public expenditure implication, so I should be grateful if she would advise me of the Government's stance on the subject. The Minister looks quizzical; perhaps she did not catch what I said. I was talking about the Barcelona European Council's call for an increase in the retirement age and its exhortation for access to early retirement programmes to be restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My eighth question relates to the promotion of dialogue with social partners and more flexible work organisation, and specifically the call to review employment contract regulations and related costs, with the aim of promoting more jobs and achieving a balance between flexibility and security. I would welcome the Government's thoughts on that subject in terms of policy detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be grateful if, in the context of invigorating the labour markets, the Minister would say something about the plans to remove existing barriers to female labour market activity and to address the underlying factors that lead to a gender pay gap. The hon. Lady does not need to be reminded, but I am happy to remind her that there is still a significant pay gap between men and women. It is a fairly shocking state of affairs. More than 30 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act 1963—in fairness, I think that that took place under a Labour Government—I would appreciate it if she would address that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Moving speedily on, I come to question 9, on the promotion of the efficiency and integration of the EU financial services market. The Minister will be aware that the Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission and member states wish to step up efforts to ensure the full implementation of the financial services action plan by 2005 and the implementation of relevant securities legislation by 2003. Can we have an update on that? What progress has been made and will it be speeded up? What will the impact be and what is the Minister's prognosis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to question 10. The Minister will know that the documents refer to translating into action the commitments made under the European charter for small enterprises, and to encouraging risk taking through improving access to finance, especially for small and medium enterprises in their infancy. What do the Government have to say about that point? I did not expect the Minister to cover it in her relatively brief opening address, but it is of great importance to the small business community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question 11—the Minister will be delighted to know that I am moving towards a conclusion—relates to the enhancement of environmental sustainability. Reference has been made to a reduction in sectoral subsidies and other measures that have a negative environmental impact. What do the Government intend to do on that front? What do they regard as measures that have such an impact? Do they accept that sectoral subsidies need to be reduced or tempered in some way, and can we have particulars? In effect, the issue is grouped with the agreement to be reached by December this year on an appropriate framework for energy taxation at the European level. I will keep my powder dry on the merits or demerits of a European energy taxation policy. The Minister will not need to be Sherlock Holmes to discern that I might have some anxiety or scepticism on that front. On this occasion, I am less interested in conveying my thoughts to her than in her conveying her thoughts and those of the Government to me and members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the level of borrowing, which is extremely important in the context of the sustainability of economic growth, the balance of the public finances, and—I will say it before the Minister does—the priority that the Government attach to the avoidance of boom and bust. I am sure that she will have taken note of the observations of the Bank of England last week. She will be especially aware of the remarks made by Mr. Clementi and reported in 	<i>The Times</i> last Friday. According to figures produced by Bank of England staff, the jump in mortgage borrowing has pushed household debt to a record 120 per cent. of income. Low borrowing costs mean that that debt burden is currently affordable, but will not be so indefinitely. Will the Minister give us her interpretation of the current figures and their implications for economic stability? It is of concern to her, Committee members, businesses and householders. It is also of concern to the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also know of the observations of the Monetary Policy Committee earlier this year. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
minutes of the meetings held on 9 and 10 January emphasised the concern of some of its members that the worsening imbalances in the economy posed a particular threat. It pointed out that real domestic demand growth had exceeded real output growth by 5.7 per cent. over the past five years. It said that that was unsustainable, and talked about the state of indebtedness and the need for retrenchment. It continued that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a further stimulus to domestic demand … through another cut in interest rates would worsen the imbalances and could make it more difficult to keep inflation close to target in the medium term".</p></blockquote>
I fear that the Minister will not want to comment, but it would be useful to know if she goes along with that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying about indebtedness. Does he agree that a possible way through that, especially as far as pensions are concerned, is for there to be some degree of compulsory saving, however that might be achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to tempt me. Considerable thought is being given to the formulation of a detailed, credible, costed and attractive Conservative pension policy to juxtapose with the miserable and embarrassing failure of the Labour Government's policy on the provision of pensions over the past five years. As hon. Members will have noticed, I have been measured, temperate, and almost consensual. The hon. Gentleman is threatening to cause an imbalance in the Committee. I could easily be tempted to dilate on that matter at some length, but it would only prevent other Members from speaking, which I have no desire to do. In any case, it is properly for "two brains"—my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions—to introduce our credible proposals in due course. It is not for me, a mere humble underling, to seek to anticipate what he might choose to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is the Minister concerned that Britain has plummeted from ninth to 16th in the world competitiveness league since the Government took office? What does she propose to do about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow that long list of questions from the hon. Member for Buckingham, but I should like to raise a few points with the Minister. There are some points in the documents that are worth welcoming. The first is the progress that most countries are making towards solving the pension liability issue. Concern about the position in some other European countries has been raised in the House over many years. It is relatively easy for Governments to solve the problem by simply cutting back the entitlements that they intend to give to people, but that does not solve it from the point of view of current and future pensioners. There is a serious problem in the UK. The Conservatives solved it by breaking the link between pensions and earnings. They reduced future Government liabilities at a stroke, but at the same time created a situation where pension entitlements are clearly too low for many to have a reasonable quality
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
of life in the future and savings are well below the required levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Will he confirm that he and the Liberal Democrats endorse the breaking of the link between pensions and earnings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no intention of restoring the link, but that is not the point. The point is that where that link is broken in the general pension provision—there is a good argument for breaking it because it provides a substantial Government resource to people who do not need it as well as to those who do—it needs to be replaced with a system that provides either the support for those who do not make that investment for themselves or incentives to make that investment. Our proposed alternative increases the incentive and, as the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) suggested, involves a required second state pension, but with support for those who cannot afford to make that investment for themselves. There would be means-testing during people's working lives. Means-testing at the point of retirement fails to give many individuals the support that they need, either because they feel that it is wrong to claim or because they cannot work their way through the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when other European countries are wrestling with the problem and looking for alternatives that provide that protection, there is an unfunded liability for the nation as a whole here. It does not appear in the balance books because it is not a Government liability. Ultimately it becomes a Government liability if many pensioners are too poor to support themselves in the future and the savings systems do not provide the incentives to make that investment. With many companies now ending pension schemes tied to earnings themselves, with returns on investments lower and likely to be lower in the future, ironically, because of the Government's success in part in dealing with inflation, there is a growing issue for this country to tackle. We must not simply feel that we have avoided the problem because it is does not appear on the Government's long-term balance sheets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue, which I touched on when I asked the Minister a question, is the welcome recognition by the Commission of the need for the UK to invest, that there has been long-term under-investment and that that impacts on the issue of the Government's borrowing, especially given the overall low debt-to-income ratio in the UK for Government. There is a specific reference to the matter in article 104 of the treaty, and page 65 of the Commission report notes that levels of public sector net investment are
	<br><blockquote><p>"addressing the low level of government investment",</p></blockquote>
which is welcome, but, that said, the Minister would acknowledge that in the first five years of this Government, Labour increased the problem with an historically extraordinary low level of public sector net investment of only 0.6 per cent. of gross domestic product, compared with 1.5 per cent. in the last five years of the Conservative Government, which was itself historically low. Clearly, we have a long way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
As the Government are clearly concerned that the constraints of the treaty might have an impact on the matter and have welcomed the flexibility that I referred to, perhaps the Minister will say what the Government believe needs to be done in terms of future public sector investment. Even the Government's latest projections are not historically high; for example, it will take, at best, many decades to tackle the transport problem, and the projections are, arguably, still so low, despite the increases that the Government plan, that they are unlikely to do anything to tackle the problem and reverse many decades of historic under-investment. One way or the other, that has considerable implications for the Government's position in terms of taxation or borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I welcome the recognition of the importance of cyclical adjustments to Budget estimates, which is a point of criticism for those who cast doubt on the growth and stability pact. In practice, the Commission has been far more realistic than some suggested that it would be and I hope that the Minister will agree that it is sensible to see how the pact is interpreted in practice rather than considering some of the wild assumptions that have been made in the past. In practice, the Commission has shown that it works with a degree of realism and prudence about what is going on in the real world, although some suggested that it would not. That needs to be built on. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on how the Government see the latest responses from other countries and the Commission in terms of that interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of caution, there is an extraordinary statement in the Commission report that a successful economy requires lower taxes. To some degree that is true; there is a level of taxation that is unsustainable. Budget decisions should be taken to ensure long-term growth and stability in the economy and the real issue is the balance between tax and spend. Whether that is a few per cent. higher or lower compared with other countries is not fundamental. The Conservative party, particularly the Thatcherites, argued that low expenditure was good in itself, and we now have to deal with the consequences: under-investment in health, education and transport. I hope that Ministers will use their influence to steer the Commission away from a view that I suspect they do not have, but which, if they are suggesting that they have it, will potentially weight things in a way that would be highly undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have a view about the proportion of national income that should be spent by the state? Would he place a limit on that share?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have set out our views in two respects: first, in our alternative Budget. The hon. Gentleman labours under a difficulty as his party currently has no alternative Budget and no alternative policies. That gives wide scope for criticism, but it allows little room to make any proposals. We have drawn up an alternative Budget year by year for more than a decade, which will show the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
exactly what we believe in any given year. In the longer term, some eight or nine years ago we proposed tests of Government spending in respect of long-term balance and not borrowing except to invest, which the Government now adopt in their policies. We share that view. I am pleased that the Conservative party recently adopted the policy, but it previously objected to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. Some economies have high levels of public spending and the state has a much larger slice of the economy than here, yet they remain healthy economies doing extremely well. With appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, cannot a much higher level of public spending be sustained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but with two caveats. We live in an era of increasing globalisation, which puts pressure on countries with high levels of spending to bring it down. That often happens in European countries with historically high public expenditure through a process of tax competition. The second important caveat is that when one digs into the figures, one often finds that the real issue is whether spending on pensions is primarily directed through the state or through individual pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examining the breakdown of individual expenditure and taking it across the board on housing, pensions, health and so forth makes the differences much smaller than they appear in the prima facie Government expenditure figures. That applies particularly to pension expenditure. One of the reasons for the UK's relatively low GDP figures is that much of our pension spending is private. It is similar to the United States, which has low levels of Government spending because of the low levels of public health expenditure, but individuals have to pay high levels. It is possible to gain a rather distorted view of the differences between countries. At the end of the day, providing an adequate transport, health and pension system requires expenditure, and we have to make choices about whether the state is the best provider. In some cases it is, in others it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Luton, North suggests, stable economic management is crucial. Another irony of Conservative attacks on the Commission's views on the stability and growth pact is that the Commission argues for precisely the same stable economic management that is implied by Conservative criticisms of the Government, which was the point of the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never has an hon. Gentleman said so much, revealed so little and been in such indecent haste to blow his own trumpet—a veritable Liberal Democrat fog is now descending upon the Committee. In his initial answer to my first question, the hon. Gentleman was striving for clarity, but he did not provide it. May I press him further? If 50 per cent. of national income were spent by the state, does he agree that that would be inimical to economic efficiency and personal freedom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some states in the European Union spend similar levels, and no one would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
describe them as unfree. The Liberal Democrats do not propose anything like that level of state spending, so our pensions policies do not mean returning to a much larger state pension scheme. In that sense, the hon. Gentleman may be right: we do not believe in such a shift because, as long as people make the investment, the private sector will be better at delivering pensions. We should examine the incentives and requirements on individuals, not just the vehicles of pension saving on which the Government have mainly concentrated. Their approach has failed to deliver the necessary improvements in personal pension investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another serious cause for concern applies not only to the UK, but across the board, although the UK is probably further advanced in the area, if "advanced" is the right word, and may therefore have the greatest concern about it. I refer to the lack of commentary on the financing vehicles, and their proliferation, that are off the balance sheet, which may mean compliance with the letter rather than the spirit of the guidelines—for example, in terms of whether the treatment of private finance and PPP appear on the Government's balance sheets. We are talking about a commitment to public expenditure that affects the proportion of Government spending, and therefore the overall balance between tax and spend. However, because of the way in which the Government treat those areas, many of the figures are off the balance sheet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal may suit an individual Government's need to make their figures look good but throws into doubt the efficacy of the process of ensuring that individual countries behave in a way that is good for overall economic balance, which has knock-on consequences for other countries. The Government may trust themselves—I have greater doubts—to exercise the measure with the utmost discretion and only in the most appropriate circumstances, but I am not sure that they would trust Greece or Italy to do the same, and there is concern that what the previous Conservative Government pioneered, which was legally taken up by the Government, is spreading across Europe and may throw the process into doubt. One could comment on Italy in relation to that but it is a notable exception. By and large, the Commission has bought into the tendency to put spending off the balance sheet. I have reservations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to my earlier point on the Government's growth figures. I hope that the Minister is right about the robustness of the Government's decision to increase their view of long-term trend growth just as the economy entered a more difficult patch than they had previously encountered, as it became increasingly evident that the Government failed to achieve all their targets on increased productivity and as business investment started falling through the floor. The Commission's commentary, agreed by Council Ministers, was based on previous, more prudent figures, and the fact that the figures have changed has a significant effect on judgments about the Government's ability to deliver. My view is that the growth figures are broadly achievable. We criticised the Government's original decision to cut the figures and said from the beginning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
that it was a way of building an election war chest— which is exactly what it proved to be. Our opposition to the Government's low spending in their early years also subsequently proved right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government projections may be right but the Government have been much more inconsistent than the Liberal Democrats. It is not obvious what has changed in the period between Labour's coming into office or how that affects the long-term growth projections. The figures that would affect long-term growth have all gone in a direction detrimental to the Government's ability to achieve increased growth. The Minister may want to comment on that and will, I hope, elaborate on whether there have been discussions, with the Commission, in the Council of Ministers or with other countries, about the UK's decision to change its projections. From what the Commission says, the Government's ability to deliver on the terms of the pact would have raised eyebrows in the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.29 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate and I particularly welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor), who welcomed the progress that has been made by European Union countries, particularly on pension liabilities and generally on reforming their economies. They have tackled successfully some of the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness and promoted employment and social inclusion. Member states can be proud of the fact that 5 million jobs have been created in the EU since the Lisbon Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the time available, I shall try to tackle some of the points raised by the hon. Members for Buckingham and for Truro and St. Austell. I thank the hon. Member for Buckingham for his kind words at the start of his speech. However, he said that he approved of discussions with the European Commission if, and only if, they were useful. It is common sense to talk to people if it is useful, but maintaining good relationships is also useful. In the context of peer review, discussions on broad economic policy guidelines and stability and growth programmes are useful in both our own context and the broader context of European policy co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to confirm that the Government would reduce public expenditure or increase taxes only for national reasons rather than artificially to meet some Commission objective. That is clear, and I should point out that we are broadly in agreement with the Commission's outlook on the need for promoting structural and economic reform across Europe and for liberalising our labour, product and capital markets. We support the thrust of the broad economic policy guidelines and welcome the comments that have been made about the United Kingdom because they tally neatly with our own domestic objectives. We are taking action to continue that process of economic reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the UK was taking action to strengthen the incentives to take up work, and I point to our record of job creation. We have created 1.5 million jobs since 1997. We have put

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
in place a framework that makes work pay, by introducing for the first time a minimum wage supported by a comprehensive system of tax credits. We have a comprehensive strategy to create employment and support jobs. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the national insurance reforms. He should examine national insurance as a package and not neglect the reforms that we made in 1998, which had a positive effect on the labour supply. Indeed, the Commission has recognised the UK's achievements in reforming the labour markets and creating jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both hon. Gentlemen pointed to the need for our population to save more during their working life and for us to examine the incentives to save. The hon. Member for Buckingham noted that the savings ratio has fallen under this Government. It is fine for him to point to a high savings ratio as a measure of success under his Government, but most people would see that high savings ratio as a response to boom and bust— dare I repeat the words—and the need for consumers to retrench and save in the face of extremely unstable economic conditions. A high savings ratio by itself is no sign of economic success. We want people to be able to take a long-term view about their savings needs for the future. We also want a macroeconomic environment in which it makes sense for a rational consumer to choose to save.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it is a pleasure to hear the Financial Secretary attack the Conservatives, her comments seem a little odd, if I am to judge her correctly. She is arguing that the low savings ratio is good, because people do not need to save in a stable economy. Will she clarify that she is concerned that the current level of saving is too low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am concerned. Although, as I was saying, a high savings ratio is not in itself a sign of success, I agree that we must raise the savings ratio and that people are not saving enough for their retirement. That is why we have commissioned various reviews. For the DWP, Alan Pickering is considering the simplification of pensions, and for the Treasury, Ron Sandler is considering the competitive forces underlying the long-term retail savings industry. The Inland Revenue is considering the simplification of the taxation system for pensions across defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. We have asked those reviews, which are co-ordinated, to consider ways in which it might be easier for people to save in future and to report to us. We accept that people need to save more and we are taking action to ensure that doing so is as easy as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham talked about the number and the cost of regulations that we have put in place, and the way in which the Government are business-friendly. Regulations must be fair and effective so that they protect the vulnerable, but clearly they must not stifle enterprise or productivity. That is why we are committed—through the small business service, for example—to ensuring that the voice of small business is heard throughout Whitehall; why the ministerial panel on regulatory accountability holds Ministers to account for their regulatory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
performance; and why there is a central unit in the Cabinet Office to ensure that all new regulations meet the principles of good regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also taking measures to cut red tape on business. If the hon. Gentleman looks back at the Budget, he will see that there was an increase in the statutory audit threshold for companies from £350,000 to £1 million, relieving up to 150,000 small firms from the burden of statutory audit. The VAT registration threshold has been increased to £55,000—the highest level in the EU—and the optional flat rate of VAT has been introduced, saving more than 500,000 small firms up to £1,000 a year in compliance costs. Other deregulatory measures were announced in the Budget, including the fact that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is taking forward Patrick Carter's recommendations to encourage the filing of PAYE returns and help small employers to manage the task of dealing with the payroll. We take our responsibility to cut red tape extremely seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying hard and she has a brief, but unfortunately it does not stack up on this occasion. Does she recall that the noble Lord Haskins, charged with responsibility for the Better Regulation Task Force, criticised Government policy on these matters as a dog's breakfast? Is she aware that the average small business now faces a greater burden of regulation than at any time? That includes the burden of person hours that owner/managers or managers have to spend attending to these matters each week. When the Minister talks about cutting regulation, is she seriously committed to ensuring that the burden of regulation on companies in Britain is lower at the end of this Parliament than it was at the beginning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are committed to fair and effective regulation that protects employees and introduces decent minimum standards—something that the Opposition have failed to grasp over decades—while reducing compliance costs by the greatest degree possible. We are committed to that, and we are carrying it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman pointed to our record on productivity, an issue that the European Commission raised. We are committed to raising productivity growth over the long term, and I believe that the policies that the Government have put in place, and those that we are actively pursuing for the future, will continue to narrow the UK's productivity gap with our major competitors. Since 1991, productivity within the UK has improved, leading to a narrowing of the UK productivity gap with our European competitors. Between 1995 and 2000, the productivity gap with France was reduced by 9 per cent. from 27 per cent. to 18 per cent. and the gap with Germany fell by 6 per cent. from 14 per cent. to 8 per cent. The Government are building a platform of economic stability and pursuing microeconomic measures that will increase productivity in the long term. The hon. Member for Buckingham should know that the only year in which productivity in this country fell was under his party's Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised several other points, including the gender pay gap. I accept that the UK still has a problem with a 19 per cent. gap, partly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
accounted for by the fact that women are choosing lower paid jobs and work fewer hours. Further progress remains to be made and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, also the Minister for Women, is actively pursuing an agenda to close the pay gap. The new deal for lone parents, the introduction of child care tax credit and improving the availability and quality of child care are all important. In comparison with our European partners, this country has a high women's employment rate, of which we should be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not detract from the significance of those measures, but do the Government centrally keep details, including statistical evidence, of cases brought against rogue employers by employees who are legitimately indignant about unequal treatment? If so, would not periodic communication of such details act as a deterrent to such rogue employers and an incentive to good behaviour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am heartened by the hon. Gentleman's interest in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing new about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that there is nothing new about it, but I am genuinely delighted at his active interest in these issues. I shall pass on his comments to the Minister for Women. I am not sure what records are held centrally on particular cases, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend will look further into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about financial services. He mentioned that the Commission wanted to continue to maintain momentum towards completion of the financial service action plan and had stressed the importance of developing an integrated single market in capital—both for industry and, ultimately, for consumers who should benefit from lower prices and greater choice. The United Kingdom Government remain committed to the financial service action plan and my right hon. Friend has been active in championing these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Barcelona summit earlier this year, progress has been made in several respects with political agreement already reached on the market abuse directive, the conglomerates directive and the pensions directive, which I mentioned earlier in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe. We have already adopted measures on national and international accounting standards, which will make an important contribution to the EC. The Danish presidency will also make progress on the prospectives directive. Momentum has been maintained at the EU level. We must ensure that all directives go back to first principles and that we always argue about their effect on lowering capital costs across Europe and the achievement of an integrated capital market. We must ensure that industry and consumers benefit from measures agreed at the EU level. That remains our priority when we negotiate the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham asked about the Government's attitude to encouraging risk taking. I would have thought that he would have realised by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
now my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's commitment to encouraging risk taking, small firms, entrepreneurship, innovation, and the links between science and industry. He will see from the recent Budget that cuts in corporation tax and capital gains tax mean that the tax regime for entrepreneurship in this country is more favourable than in any other major industrialised country, including the United States. We are also setting up regional venture capital funds throughout the regions that will enable small growing firms to access the capital that they so clearly need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the remarks made by Mr. Clementi—the deputy governor of the Bank of England and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee—at a recent hearing of the Treasury Committee. Unfortunately, I could not attend that meeting, although, of course, I read some of the commentary on those remarks. This country has a stable and effective monetary and fiscal policy framework. As the hon. Gentleman knows, one of our first acts on coming to power in 1997 was to make the Bank of England independent. We now have the lowest inflation and interest rates in 40 years. Strong, decisive and early action can be taken on interest rates because there is no political interference in our monetary policy decisions. Inflation expectations over the longer term have also been lowered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case the Minister is in any doubt, or lest she has not had the pleasure of reading the speech that was delivered a few weeks ago on this matter by my hon. Friend the Member for Havant, the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, I am happy to confirm that the Conservative Opposition believe that the Government have been vindicated on the independence of the Bank of England. I do not hesitate to put that on the record a second time. However, does she accept, as we have argued, that there is a compelling case for four-year non-renewable term limits for members of the Monetary Policy Committee? In the name of underlining the independence of the Bank of England, does she also accept that there is a powerful case for the establishment of a joint parliamentary Committee with a duty to appoint the Governor of the Bank of England, the deputy governor, and members of the Monetary Policy Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Gentleman makes it clear that he is talking about the Conservative, not the Liberal Democrat, Opposition. That is always useful to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a limit to what I can be responsible for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, I am slightly astonished that he thinks that a four-year, rather than a three-year, term for members of the Monetary Policy Committee would markedly enhance the credibility of the Bank of England. I am sceptical that an extra year would transform the operation of monetary policy in this country. I am also not persuaded of the merits of having a parliamentary and/or political entree into the appointments of the Bank of England Governor and deputy governor. The existing system preserves a high degree of independence for the Bank.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
The fact that we set the framework for monetary policy and inflation targets, and the Bank publishes inflation reports that the Treasury Committee scrutinises, also ensures that it is accountable through the Government and Parliament for the operation of monetary policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's position on this matter is baffling. She cavils at the idea of a parliamentary Committee being responsible for appointments in the way that I suggested, arguing that she does not think that there is merit in the process being politicised in the way that she thinks would result. Does she seriously argue against the politicisation of the process via power being given to a joint parliamentary committee, but contend instead that those appointments, which should not be tainted or undermined by the vulgarity of politicians, should lie in the hands of her right hon. Friend the Chancellor, who, unless I am much mistaken, is a politician?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, the only person who argues that the appointment system for the Monetary Policy Committee members is political and that they are politicised through the current process is the hon. Gentleman himself. The current system is highly regarded in and outside Parliament and around the world. The hon. Gentleman must be aware that MPC members have the chance to be scrutinised by the Treasury Select Committee as part of the appointment process. People have the opportunity to take a view on the merits or demerits of their appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many issues on which the hon. Gentleman is on his own, but this is not one of them. I refrained from intervening a moment ago because he refused to take any responsibility for the Liberal Democrats and I had no wish to take responsibility for the Conservatives. We have long advocated extended but non-renewable terms for Bank of England measures. We are glad to see the Conservatives adopt that policy. It extends the principle of independence for the MPC quite substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the present Chancellor may be a wholly apolitical individual, although his role as chairman of the Labour party general election campaign twice running slightly belies that, a future Chancellor might not feel so constrained if the MPC did not follow the expected line. We see exactly that principle in the United States with Presidents able to influence, for example, the Supreme Court through the appointments process. If the Minister believes that the MPC should be wholly independent, I urge her to consider such a process. Incidentally, a peculiarity of the MPC, because it is technically—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There was insufficient self-restraint in that intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: MPC appointments are slightly different to other appointments. I do not quite understand the hon. Gentleman's approach. I do not know whether he envisages a process in which, for example, there might be six candidates for a particular
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
MPC appointment who then duly come before a parliamentary committee to express their views and be judged suitable or unsuitable. Traders in the City would be at their screens anxiously awaiting the committee's decision. These are highly market-sensitive appointments. In that sense they are not directly analogous to other appointments. Our system allows for effective parliamentary scrutiny and extremely thorough external scrutiny too of the functioning of the MPC and the decisions that it makes through the prompt and regular publication of the minutes of its board meetings. There are regular appearances before the Treasury Committee and of course members of the MPC are also allowed to speak freely on issues of their choice outside those hearings. We have an extremely transparent and effective system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are leading us rather far from the subject of the debate. Would my hon. Friend agree that if we were to politicise the selection of MPC members to the extent suggested, it would be seen as an attempt to claw back the independence given to the committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely interesting point. However, we should probably draw the debate on these issues to a close before tackling some of the other matters that have been raised. The hon. Member for Buckingham also mentioned the recent publication of the world competitiveness league tables, in which the UK performance and ranking increased. The commentary associated with the publication of that league table said that the United Kingdom was the world's third most resilient economy. The hon. Gentleman must put the rankings in context; for example, the UK economy better withstood the global uncertainties recently and the downturn after 11 September. The UK was the fastest growing of all the G7 economies in 2001 and the international organisations that make such forecasts predict that it will grow faster in the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the points raised by the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell were dealt with in the debate. I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the need for the United Kingdom to invest. He claimed that investment is projected to double—I think, although I stand to be corrected—between the years 2000–01 and 2005–06. We are taking action on a wide range of fronts to increase investment; the hon. Members are aware of debates in the House on raising the level of investment in the national health service. We await the outcome of the spending review, which will allocate investment over a three-year period at least, to our public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Doubling the investment sounds impressive until we realise that the Government halved it after taking office. It is still low by historic standards, even at the levels that the Government project. I asked whether the Minister believes that those levels of investment will deliver the goods or whether there is not a good case for increasing them further, as is implied by the Government's concern about the stability and growth pact rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the stability and growth pact and the need to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
recognise the crucial importance of reversing years of chronic under-investment in our public services and I welcome his comments on the subject. We are the first Government to set out more than one year at a time in our spending plans and part of the problem, historically, is that public investment has always suffered during fiscal retrenchment. We aim to overcome that by setting out three-year plans and programmes in our spending review announcements. In specific sectors such as the NHS and transport we set out 10-year programmes, which will go a long way to overcoming some of the historic problems in those sectors, although I do not under-estimate the importance of raising the overall levels of investment in other areas, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also pointed out the need for a balance between tax and spend and I am completely in accord with him on that matter. We need fiscal sustainability underpinning measures to increase productivity, promote enterprise and pursue structural and economic reform across the European Union. Fiscal sustainability is the key issue in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made other points, too, some of which were merely about taking the process further. I welcome the fact that he recognises the importance of the peer review process and the contribution that the broad economic policy guidelines and the stability and convergence programmes can make to the process of peer review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with growth in my earlier comments. I said that I wanted the process taken further. The hon. Gentleman pointed to the case of Italy, which the European Commission examined, arguing that further debate on the sustainability of member states' accounts would be helpful. I agree that the process could be furthered in various respects. We are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
committed to peer review and we want a genuine debate about fiscal sustainability and structural and economic reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage the Committee to support the Government's welcome of the publication of the Commission's recommendations on broad economic policy guidelines. They provide operational content to the conclusions of the Lisbon and Stockholm summits, reflecting the importance of structural reform and successfully tackling the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness and promoting employment and social inclusion. The motion also welcomes Council opinions and statements on stability and convergence programmes as promoting the objective of sound Government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions of price stability and strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
