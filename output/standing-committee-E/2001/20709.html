	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Hazel Blears)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to be in Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Hurst. While opening the debate, I shall refer to the proposals in European Union documents 11496/01 and 11576/01 that relate to genetically modified food and feed, and the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms. The documents and the issues involved are complex and wide ranging, but the debate will provide a welcome opportunity to reappraise how Europe can best ensure safety and deliver reliable consumer choice in connection with genetically modified food and crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has proposed two regulations. The first would involve a centralised safety assessment system for GM food and feed, with the proposed European food safety authority at the centre of the process. For the first time, specific rules would be introduced for the authorisation of GM animal feed. The existing labelling rules for GM food would also be extended. The proposal is linked closely to a second proposal on traceability and labelling, which aims to create a harmonised European Union system for tracing and identifying genetically modified organisms, including food, feed and seeds, and products derived from them, at all stages of their being placed on the market through the production and distribution chains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several EU member states have declared that they will not re-engage in the decision-making process for GM crops and food until regulations on traceability and labelling for GMOs are in place. There is some doubt, however, whether that would unblock the process, but the Commission is presenting the proposals as an attempt to improve consumer information and choice on GMOs. The proposals also have important implications for food production costs and will impact on the EU's trade partners, including developing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the proposals in detail, I shall summarise briefly the existing rules. The main legislation that authorises the placing on the market of genetically modified organisms in the Community is directive 90/220/EC. GMOs are assessed on a case-bycase basis for safety, and decisions are made on whether to grant or refuse an authorisation. For GM goods, the EC novel foods regulation, 258/97, requires
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that they be rigorously assessed for safety before they can be authorised for sale. The current labelling rules require foods to be labelled if they contain genetically modified material, which is novel DNA or protein. That approach, which is both practical and enforceable, is intended to provide consumers with clear choices regarding the food that they eat. No specific Community legislation on the approval and labelling of GM feed exists at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the European Commission's proposal. I shall address first the GM food and feed proposal, the main elements of which are the safety assessment process, labelling and thresholds for the unintended presence of GM material in non-GM supplies. Under the proposal, the European food safety authority will be responsible for the safety assessment, although it will be able to subcontract an initial assessment to a member state. As I said earlier, this country already has in place a robust safety assessment system for GM food. All applications, whether they originate in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe, are scrutinised in detail at the moment by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes. In future, the European food safety authority, which will be at the centre of such a process, can ask member states to carry out that initial assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to labelling, which has probably generated the most extensive debate over the past year. The key point is that the rules proposed by the Commission require all foods produced from GMOs to be labelled, whether or not they differ analytically from conventionally sourced ingredients. At first sight, that would seem to be a step towards greater consumer choice, but detailed consideration of the proposals suggests that that would create real practical difficulties. The Government have serious worries about the enforceability and practicality of that approach because any labelling or documentation claims could not be verified by scientific analysis and could therefore be open to fraud, which may result in the consumer being misled. As the results of chemical analysis of products derived from GMOs would be the same as those for products from non-GMO sources, no scientific analysis could be done to establish the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fully support the intention of increasing consumer choice, but we believe that the best way to achieve that would be to supplement existing rules on GM labelling with a "GM free" option. That would enable people who want to avoid all uses of GM technology to do so and would be a much more effective approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum and the regulatory impact assessment that I provided for the Committee set out four options for dealing with such matters. The first was to continue with the current rules; the second was the "GM free" option, which we believe to be the most practical; the third was the Commission's proposals as in the documents; and the fourth was an even more radical option that some Members of the European Parliament would advocate—to label not only products derived from GMOs but enzymes and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
processes connected with GMOs, too. In order of how radical they were, that was the spectrum of approaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission opted for what we call option C—to extend labelling to goods that are produced from GMOs but that are scientifically no different. We believe that there are real problems with that. Our preferred option was option B—to continue with current rules on labelling and add the "GM free" option. That would enable people who want nothing to do with the technology, whether relating to goods produced or goods used in the process of creating other goods, to be confident that they are not choosing GM options. We are not comfortable with the Commission's option, which I am sure hon. Members will debate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third element of the proposal relates to thresholds. Current GM labelling rules include a threshold for the accidental presence of GM material in non-GM supplies. Provided that manufacturers can show that they have made all reasonable efforts to use only non-GM supplies, they are not required to label their product as GM if the level of incidental GM material is below that 1 per cent. threshold. That recognises that non-GM foods may contain tiny amounts of GM material as a result of storage, transportation or handling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threshold is a de minimis requirement. It is currently set at 1 per cent., which reflects the capability of current detection methods and the ability of the supply chain to deliver on the threshold. I understand that GMO materials are identified through an amplification of protein in the product. With current technology, going below 1 per cent. would be difficult, especially in the case of highly processed foods. In the case of fairly simple foods, it is sometimes possible to go below that threshold, but in the case of highly processed foods, it is much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, the European Parliament voted to reduce the threshold to 0.5 per cent. The Government do not feel that that is a practical possibility at this stage, given the current state of our technology. I understand that no other member state has a regime with a threshold that requires less than 1 per cent. Indeed, thresholds vary from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent. The European Parliament's new proposal would take matters significantly further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourteen GM crops await approval in Europe and have been blocked in the approval process. To try to move that process on, the Commission proposes to include a threshold for GM varieties that await approval in Europe as well as those that have been approved, provided that those crops have undergone a safety assessment undertaken by the Commission's scientific committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise that zero presence of non-authorised GMOs is not practical given the extent to which GM crops are grown world wide. We have given our support to the European Commission for restarting the approval process for GM crops. We understand why the Commission wants to apply the 1 per cent. threshold to non-approved varieties as well as
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to approved varieties to try to get the approval process moving again, and we are prepared to support it, but we believe that the matter should be kept under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal will introduce for the first time specific rules for the approval and labelling of GM animal feed. If a GMO could be used for food and feed processes, the approval would reflect both uses. Under the proposal, the provisions for animal feed closely mirror those for human food, which is an attempt to introduce consistency and harmonisation to the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposal relates to traceability and labelling, for which harmonised rules are sought throughout the European Community. The proposal goes beyond the scope of directive 2001/18 because the rules are also applied to products derived from GM sources. Such products are not scientifically or analytically different. They include highly refined maize oil and sugars that are derived from GMOs, which are no different in their highly refined and processed composition from products derived from non-GM sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Minister and hon. Members that it is anticipated that the opening statement should last no more than 10 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hurst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main concern is that labelling systems should work in practice. We also want to ensure that the process fits in with international developments. The Cartegena protocol on biosafety is important, and the impact on developing countries is a matter of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to set out the views of the Government, the stakeholders and the European Commission. We think that measures should be practical, proportionate and enforceable, but, as they stand, we do not consider that they are in some respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have four areas of concern, but I shall start with the issue of enforcement. The European Parliament has voted for an even more draconian set of measures than the worst-case scenario that the Minister outlined. Such measures include full traceability of foods derived from GM crops, including their ingredients. What is the Minister's view of that in terms of enforcement and the cost to businesses? Her documents refer to 600,000 affected businesses and a maximum cost to them of about 1.6 billion. However, if the European Parliament measures were enforced, surely the figures would be greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct: it is estimated that 600,000 food businesses will be affected. Half of those are in the catering sector and many businesses are fairly small scale, such those in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
bakery industry. That industry is likely to be among the most affected, and the Government have concerns about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of compliance with the European Commission's proposals is set out in the regulatory impact assessment that I provided for the Committee. The estimated current cost of labelling is about £96 million. The GM-free option, which the Government believe could help to meet the requirements of consumer choice, would cost £258 million and the Commission's proposals would cost £725 million. Those costs are for labelling rather than enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment included a section in his regulatory impact assessment that addressed enforcement specifically, and the total cost of enforcement, including such things as testing and sampling, would be about £6.3 million. Clearly, the impact would be considerable. The issue is about not only enforcement, but consumer confidence. There is little point having regulations unless enforcement is effectively carried out and consumers are assured of proper compliance with the regulations. The Government share the hon. Gentleman's worries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In five years' experience of serving on European Standing Committees, this is the first time that the European Parliament has beaten us to it by taking a view before negotiations take place. How will that affect negotiations from this point, or do we all just ignore the European Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of ignoring the European Parliament. We must work properly and in harmony with our partners in Europe. We have time between the European Parliament's First Reading and the 600 amendments that were discussed last week, and its Second Reading during which we can discuss the issues further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many issues are emerging among our European colleagues. I understand that the Netherlands carried out a study that raised serious concerns about practicality, enforcement and whether the provisions are proportionate. The Netherlands shares several of this Government's concerns. We should not ignore the European Parliament but explore the areas on which there are genuine and legitimate concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government's preferred term is "GM free". The National Farmers' Union argues that GM free should mean GM free. What representations has she received on the use of those words, and what legal advice has been received on the enforceability of using the words "GM free" if they clearly do not mean GM free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is at the heart of the issue of whether we have products that are labelled "GM" to show that they contain genetically modified ingredients, whether products are not labelled at all and have a 1 per cent. threshold for GM ingredients, or whether they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
labelled to say "This is GM free." If we were to use the latter option, the product would have to have a fairly short supply chain so that the identity of all the goods in that chain could be traced. The term would have to apply to processes as well as GM products. For example, it would have to apply to any enzymes used; I understand that a GM enzyme is now commonly used in the production of most hard cheeses. There are other enzymes and processes that could not be used if a product were to be defined as completely GM free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are promoting that option, because that would be a way of providing a self-contained solution for those who have real antipathy towards genetic modification, for whatever reason, without throwing all the costs and enforceability on to the whole range of foods. Specific products that were properly and totally GM free, with proper traceability and a short supply chain, could be produced. That traceability would also have to apply to GM-free products that used milk, meat and eggs, so that it could be ensured that the animals from which they came had not been fed GM food. If there were a very short supply chain, that would be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have the opportunity to ask some questions, particularly as I am not a member of the Committee. I suppose I would count myself as a 1 per cent. adventitious contamination to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What thought was given to the compatibility of the Government's proposal for "GM-free" labelling with our earlier claims that we should pursue the principle that the polluter pays? One of the reservations expressed in farming communities about following through the proposals on liability is that, under the current proposals, the only people who would be liable are those who claim that they attempted to provide clean produce that was free from contamination. The only groups that would be free from liability are those that contaminate. In a sense, the reverse approach to that taken in the European Parliament would be the only one that would genuinely address the principle that the polluter pays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to try to ensure that we provide for those people who have expressed the clear view that they want no connection with not only GM organisms in food or feed, but also products derived from GM organisms, and the processes connected with them. We do not want to apply what I think I referred to as a radical—rather than draconian—option to the whole food and feed supply chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the only leeway that people have is the 1 per cent. threshold. If a producer were to "pollute" food over and above the threshold, to use that rather pejorative language, the produce would have to be properly labelled. Consumers would have access to enough of that information to make a properly informed choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current 1 per cent. threshold is the lowest that is possible, given the technology that is available to us to detect it if it comes as part of a large shipment of a crop such as maize, rape or soya. However, where there are products with a short supply chain—where products
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
are not being sourced from, for example, developing countries, and where it is possible to provide that sort of integrity for the product—we ought to look at that option. It has not yet been fully worked up; it will need to be developed further, if it is going to prove an attractive option in some of the negotiations that we will have with our partners in the coming few months, but it is the Government's preferred approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarity, I should remind the Committee of an entry in my declaration of interests. I am a chairman of a small food industry consultancy, but it does not have any direct relationship with genetically modified crops, products or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 of regulation 2001/0180 contains a series of definitions, but I cannot find a definition of what is a product, which first appears in paragraph 5. Can the Minister tell me what is the definition of a product, within the terms of this directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My current understanding is that it is a product that is derived from a process involving GMOs. The two examples that I have given refer to a product that is produced from the actual material—where oilseed rape is transferred into oil, or maize is transferred into maize oil, and where there is sugar that is a product of a GM organism. Those are the only two examples that I have at the moment. I understand that such a product is one that has been produced by a process that becomes highly refined, and that, therefore, its chemical and scientific make-up is no different from that of the same type of highly refined product that is produced from a non-GMO material. If I can provide the right hon. Gentleman with further details, I will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Drew 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify the situation that will come into existence if and when these changes go through? How will they impact on the national seed list? I am particularly interested in how the appeal process might be affected. If my reading of this is correct, we are narrowing—at least—this country's options with regard to its ability to inquire into the way in which a particular new seed comes on to the market. I would be interested to hear how this measure might further narrow someone's ability to appeal against the registration of a new seed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of how these proposals will impact on the appeal process. The hon. Gentleman has made an important point about the ability to trace the way in which new seeds are developed. I can undertake to find out what the effect will be on that process and to provide him with that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to correct my answer to the question of the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). I understand that in regulation 2001/0180 a product is the GMO itself that is placed on the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a small but important point. The Minister mentioned a regulatory impact assessment, but we are again faced with the possibility that RIAs might have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
disproportionate effect on smaller businesses. I am thinking particularly of things such as farmers' markets, which might find it difficult to prove to an enforcement agency the provenance of their products. Can the Minister give me any reassurance for that sector—for smaller producers, and in particular for farmers' markets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obtaining food from farmers' markets is an important and increasingly popular choice with consumers. Those markets are an increasingly important sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents refer to small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to the proposals. Traceability may be difficult with farmers' markets, but if there is a short and readily verifiable supply chain some might argue that traceability is easier. One of the selling points of farmers' markets is that produce is locally sourced and available from verifiable herds, which is part of its attraction to consumers. Equally, a case can be made that in farmers' markets suppliers operate on a small scale and have neither the ability to undertake paper audit trails nor systems such as computer databases in place. An argument can probably be made on both sides in relation to farmers' markets. Many imports from developing countries originate from conglomerates of small-scale, locally based suppliers, who would find it difficult to comply with audit trails.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee recently produced a report on genetically modified organisms. We took evidence for that report from the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission, which made it clear that it was committed to holding an open, transparent debate on GMOs. I seek assurance that whatever decision is taken by the EU, the four points on the continuum that the Minister mentioned will be part of the debate. In other words, I want to be sure that we are not ruling anything in or out. For the debate to be meaningful, it has to encompass all positions to make people feel that it is worthwhile participating. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had an opportunity to read the whole Select Committee report, but I have had a chance to look at its conclusions on the launch of the public debate. It urges an open-minded, transparent, rigorous debate to examine the scientific evidence, and highlights
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to rebuild public confidence in science as an instrument of public policy".</p></blockquote>
That issue should be looked at with reference to rigorously assessed evidence. We need to engage the public in those issues, which are sometimes complex. The language used can exclude people and it will be important in the wide-ranging debate, which has been universally welcomed, that we try to explain the issues in a way that relates to people's lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Food, feed and seeds are clearly fundamental to people's sense of well-being and confidence. I am happy to assure my hon. Friend that those measures are separate from the debate because we are making decisions and taking a view on the proposals. Clearly,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
we ought to discuss all those issues in an open-minded, transparent, rigorous way that considers the evidence and the science. Crucially, we need to engage the public as much as we possibly can. Due to its technical nature, the subject can sometimes be unduly exclusive of the public, who are obviously the most important partners in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new procedures will be centred on the European food authority, but it is not clear which scientific committee will be involved in making the safety assessment. Can the Minister tell us which committee it will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment in this country we have two separate committees: the novel foods committee looks at novel foods containing new protein or new DNA, which includes a wider range of foods than just GMOs; the animal feeds committee considers issues relating to animals. It is proposed that a European scientific committee should study those matters, but its exact composition has yet to be determined. A committee will eventually look into that whole area on a European level. In future, the authorisations will not only be for GM food but for GM feed. The phrase used in the regulatory impact assessment is the
	<br><blockquote><p>"one door-one key principle",</p></blockquote>
which means that the same issues will be considered for products that could be used for both food and feeds. There will be a European scientific committee, but understand that its exact composition has not yet been determined. Importantly, the European food safety authority will work with member states on scientific committees, which will still have a role, particularly for non-GM novel foods that come on to the market but do not necessarily fall into this category. We hope that the EFSA operates in a similar way to the Food Standards Agency in this country and is as transparent, inclusive and open with the public as it possibly can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister wants the debate to be based on sound science and I welcome the observations about the need to connect the scientific scrutiny to the framework being adopted by international organisations. I have a question about the unique codes that the European Parliament and the European Union are discussing. As I understand it, such codes will be based on a much more precise notion of genetic categorisation, which will require identification of a gene in a gene sequence. That will be extremely useful to the scientific debate and to the scrutiny and traceability agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the location of a gene in the gene sequence cannot be identified for any GM crop that at present has approval or is under trial. It will require a new leap into the science of scrutiny. What will happen with the GM crops that have approval or are under trial for which information about unique coding cannot yet be provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that is a future development. I am not aware of what effect development of the unique codes will have on the crops that have been approved. At present, 14 crops are waiting for approval, which has been blocked. An important proposal before the Committee is to ensure that we move the process forward while providing a proper safety assessment of each of those crops. I understand that crops that have already been approved will be resubmitted for approval when the unique codes are developed. Therefore, there will be a further opportunity to examine them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important part of the proposals is the attempt—we do not yet know how successful it will be—to restart the process. The Government want proper safety assessments and proper checks and balances, but they do not want the blockage in the system that has prevented crops from being taken forward for consideration since 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is possible to achieve genetic modification of a plant by what would be described as normal plant-breeding techniques, as opposed to man-made intervention. If one of two crops had been genetically modified but was the same as the other, which had had been modified by normal plant breeding techniques in other words, they were genetically indistinguishable—would the plant-breeding technique outcome be covered by the directive, and how would one tell the difference between the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has a much more extensive background in and knowledge of the science behind genetic modification of plants than I have. I am not aware that normal plant breeding techniques can produce a product or material that is identical to a genetically modified organism. It may well be the case; I am simply not aware of it. Therefore, it would be dangerous for me to hazard any opinion on whether the product of natural hybridisation would be covered. I am aware, as a keen gardener, that it is possible for natural hybridisation to produce new varieties; otherwise we would not have some of the wonderful plants that we have today. However, I do not know whether a naturally crossed variety would be genetically the same as a genetically modified organism. I shall find out a little more about the science and, if that is so, discover whether the proposals would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point that I have been trying to draw out for hon. Members is that when labelling requirements relate to products that are scientifically indistinguishable from GM products, it is difficult for the enforcement authority to carry out sampling checks and inspections and to discover whether the claims for a product are verifiable. The important issue is consumer confidence. It is all very well setting up a complex system of labelling and traceability, but consumer confidence will be at risk without enforcement and compliance. That is an important key point. I shall certainly find out more about the science for the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend ruled out the labelling of processed material that is analytically indistinguishable from material derived from a GM source on the grounds of practicality and enforcement, but not on principle. Why will she not rule it out on principle also, given that if it is analytically indistinguishable, what difference does it make?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of trying to obtain the right balance. As with most of these proposals, I am rapidly discovering that the balance is between pure science, public perception, consumer confidence, and people wanting as much information as possible to enable them to make informed choices. That must be balanced against practicality, enforceability, proportionate measures and common sense. I would not want to rule something out as a matter of principle, because it is right for a regulatory authority to try to strike the right balance. People hold strong views on these issues, which is why the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee called for a wide-ranging public debate. Some people hold very strong views. The Select Committee also called for a scientific base to inform that debate and to engage the public. It would be inappropriate for the Government as a regulatory authority at this point to take an "in principle" view. We are seeking to accommodate the wishes of those who genuinely do not want any contact with GM technology, whether products, organisms or processes, by having a "GM-free" label. To enable the vast majority to rely on labelling when products contain more than 1 per cent. GM products, they are labelled "GM" and consumers have sufficient information to make a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister expand on the importation of feedingstuff and the required documentation? If a farmer imports soya for feed and has no documentation, would he have to bear the cost of testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether testing costs would have to be borne by the person importing the goods to provide documentary information for the supply chain process. The hon. Gentleman raises an important point because costs will be as important for that sector as for the manufactured food sector. We want to ensure that the provisions are proportionate in their impact and instil confidence in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now understand that the costs would have to be borne by the importer if the documents were not available to him, so it is important to ensure that documentation is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just about got my mind around substantive equivalents, on which I can wax lyrical, but I am a little confused about the new concept of one door, one key. Can my hon. Friend advance some examples of how that might operate, given that one of the benefits of being opposed to GM, as she has already said, is that one can be completely opposed to it? We now have a muddying of principles: it appears that, on the one hand, someone can apply for one GM application and, on the other, that allows the person to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
do something else with the GM products, which I have not quite got my mind around. Can she give me some examples to show why that will be better?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right that we try to apply the same principles to assessments for the goods, irrespective of the use to which they are to be put. If someone has an authorisation application for both food and feed, the same analysis, the same process and the same principles should be applied to them. Companies could apply for approval to grow crops and to use them for food and seed with a single application. To try to make sure that the measures are proportionate, practical and easier to use, the proposals allow people to make a single application and have a single assessment for the variety of uses to which they may want to put some of the crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some GM products can be used in food applications for humans, feed applications for stock and also in seed applications. The proposal enables that to be undertaken through one process. The substantive equivalent process would not be available for all those different uses; this proposal makes the process simpler, more transparent and more easily understood for people who have to engage with the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 9 of document 2001/0173 allows for existing products to continue to be placed on the market. What is the scope of that? What products does it cover?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the products already approved for importation and processing are soya beans, oil seed rape and maize that has insect and herbicide tolerance. Those products are currently approved for importation and processing only, not for growing in the EU, because we are awaiting the outcome of the large-scale field evaluation trials, certainly in this country. Products of that nature are covered by the measure, but none of them is approved for growing here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3.2 at the beginning of the report mentions that the proposals are
	<br><blockquote><p>"based on the principle that the products in question must not present a danger to, or mislead, the consumer"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"anyone wishing to place them on the Community market is required to submit a request to the Member State concerned, providing the necessary supporting information. In the case of GMOs, this includes any written consents and environmental risk assessments given under the Community legislation governing the deliberate release of such organisms".</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that she was keen to unblock the consents given to crops and products in the testing pipeline. However, I received a reply yesterday from DEFRA about the environmental impact assessments, specifically in relation to the impact on soil ecology. It pointed out that we have not conducted any tests on soil ecology and that the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment—ACRE—does not plan to begin to put together a group that would consider the framework for such assessments until this summer. Do the Government plan to dispense with those tests,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
as part of the regulatory impact assessment, or to bring them forward so that we conduct them on all the crops in the testing pipeline?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's inquiry on unblocking that process is a little outwith today's debate. I was merely seeking to show that the 1 per cent. threshold would be on the crops that are currently awaiting approval, which would then require a proper risk assessment. We are beginning to unblock the process, and my hon. Friend's specific query about whether the tests would be carried out is a matter for that wider debate. I can certainly make an undertaking to provide him with that information, but that would be out with the scope of our discussion today. In the wider scheme of things, as to whether those soil tests will be carried out, I will ensure that my hon. Friends in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will let him have that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister tell me in relation to article 3.15, whether "pre-packaged" covers McDonald's or Burger King burgers? If so, would they be required to put some declaration on a label on the outer burger packaging?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had that example put to me when looking at the legislation, but there is a definition in article 15 of "pre-packaged":
	<br><blockquote><p>"'pre-packaged' means any single item for sale to the ultimate user, consisting of a product and the packaging into which it was put before being offered for sale, whether such packaging encloses the product completely or only partially, but in such a way that the contents cannot be altered without opening or changing the packaging."</p></blockquote>
Whether an individual product falls under that definition will be a matter for interpretation in relation to that individual product. I can think of items that are not enclosed in full packaging material that have a wrap around them, possibly a cardboard wrap and some sort of see-through wrapping as well. I can think of many such instances that could fall under that definition, but it would be a matter of considering each individual item. To determine whether such an item fell under that definition—a product and packaging into which it was put before being offered for sale—the process would have to be applied to each product as it came along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A burger, if it were not served as a takeaway, might not come in any packaging at all. If it were saved in a takeaway package, it may well come in a package that encloses the whole product or part of it, or it may be enclosed by something that would have to be interfered with before it could be removed. There is a range of options, and I am sure that lawyers will have some work to do in deciding to which products article 15 applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that offer of clarification, to which I look forward. I would not mind a copy of any reply she gives to the right hon. Member for Fylde about the indistinguishability of traditionally hybrid plants and those that have been genetically modified. My understanding is that there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
not such a category, and I would be excited to know about it. The specifics of the debate are about the ability of an industry to cross nature's frontiers, rather than work within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to return to the issue of liability. We have had several representations from organic farmers who have taken up the Government's invitation to be part of the conversion scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The questions are beginning to be too lengthy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will reserve them for the speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a response to make. My hon. Friend did not quite manage to ask a question. I do not think I can quite manage to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 11 deals with the modification, suspension, and revocation of authorisations. That is clearly an area in which science is moving fast. What are the grounds on which an authorisation could be modified, suspended or revoked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any specific examples of circumstances in which an authorisation could be revoked, but if an authorisation were given on a set of circumstances in relation to a product, and those circumstances were not complied with, the authorisation would not apply. I am thinking of a matter raised by one of my hon. Friends earlier on. If there were to be a considerable departure from the threshold limits for an authorisation that formed a wilful departure, the regulatory authorities would be extremely concerned about the authorisation that had been granted. The authorisation will be granted on certain terms and conditions and, as with any other regulatory framework, it will be suspended or revoked where products do not comply with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be much more succinct. What discussions have been held with organic farmers about the implications of the proposals in respect of not traceability but liability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been extensive general consultation with consumers, businesses and organisations. I am not aware of the detail of any submission about the proposals from organic producers, but if they have raised points of concern I shall gladly inform the Secretary of State of them. For organics—I may be straying from the point a little—there is a threshold of 5 per cent; for goods that can be labelled organic, 5 per cent. may be other materials. The principle of thresholds is therefore as well established for organics as it is for GMOs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the international aspects of the documents, what representations has the Minister received from countries such as the United States about the impact of regulation on multinational agreements? In response to the question on documentation and who pays, what will be the impact on third-world countries that are trying to export to the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman highlights an important concern. As well as having responsibilities to other EU states, we have a responsibility to our international trading partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of GM crops are grown in America, Canada, Australia and Argentina. I was told that an area twice the size of the UK grows GM crops. The Americans estimate that some £2.8 billion of their exports would be affected were there to be what they regard as unnecessarily restrictive provisions for traceability and labelling. That is of extreme concern to those countries. However, the matter is being considered in the context of the World Trade Organisation. We must be aware that the steps that we take—our consumers rightly want us to pursue them—have implications for the rest of the world. GM crops have been produced for more than a decade in some of those countries, which perhaps take a different attitude to GM production from that of member states of the European Union. We must take our steps in full recognition and contemplation of the fact that we have international obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue raised by the hon. Gentleman was the impact on developing countries, many of which have deep concerns over this issue. The EU has already stated—this is on record—that it does not want the provisions to act as a bar to developing countries taking a greater role in trade with the European Union. If their economies are to prosper, it is vital that they are able to participate in trade. A worry is that a system that relies on a documentary paper audit trail to make it enforceable, rather than on a chemical analysis, will make things difficult for small-scale producers in developing countries. Many of them will be small, local farmers who have come together in cooperatives to sell their goods; for them to provide a paper audit trail could be inordinately difficult. We must bear that in mind and pursue practical, enforceable and proportionate measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the same vein as the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross), I wonder how the measures will impact on the bio-safety protocol of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which recognises that we must regulate GMOs, but does not recognise the idea of traceability. Are we now likely to seek traceability in negotiations through the OECD?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, it is important that our steps recognise the overarching nature of the bio-safety protocol. The Commission's proposals conform with that protocol, but it is a matter that we shall keep under review. The protocol was endorsed by the European Environment Council meeting at the end of June and provides a framework for such issues. Although the Commission's proposals seem to be in line with the overarching protocol, we shall closely scrutinise the position because we do not want the measures adopted under the proposals to go further or outwith its provisions, which will set the framework for future developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support GM labelling and a choice for consumers, but will not the perverse effect of the proposals, especially as amended by the European Parliament, be that a person who wants to buy something as GM free as possible will not be able to identify the least GM product, because almost everything will have to be labelled as being GMO derived in some way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to strike a balance whereby we provide enough material so that consumers have an informed choice about the products that they are purchasing. At the same time, we do not want to provide an incentive for people not to label their goods correctly. If goods cannot be identified by scientific analysis, there may be a temptation under the system for people not to label processed products GM that are identical to non-GM products. There may be a perception that labelling products GM makes them less commercially attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a system cannot be enforced rigorously through sampling and inspection with the full knowledge of people, there may be a temptation not to label products correctly. The whole thrust of the proposals should be to reinforce the public's confidence that products are as they are described on the label. If a perverse incentive not to label items correctly were built into the system, consumer confidence in the entire system would be undermined. We are certainly not against consumer choice. We want that, but an overly complex system that is reliant on a paper audit control may provide a framework in which there is an incentive to label products incorrectly. That would defeat the very objective that we are trying to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission and Parliament clearly took the view that consumers should have the right to know what the producers know. If producers are using genetically modified ingredients in the food process, such a procedure should be described on the labelling. Why should United Kingdom consumers not have the right to know what the producers know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a contradiction in the Commission's proposals, in that some of them relate to process products that are derived from GMOs. We believe that that goes too far, because such products cannot be scientifically analysed. Even the Commission's proposals did not relate to products from animals that had been fed GM feed. They did not relate to milk, eggs and meat from stock that had ingested GM feed; nor did they relate to the processing agents such as the enzymes in cheese. There was not a proposal to allow people to have GM-free foods. They could not be free of GM technology. All that they could be free of was the GM product. It is right that, when people are opposed to GM, they want completely GM-free products, process materials and the enzymes that make a GM product.

There is an inherent contradiction in the Commission's own position in that it has gone for the processed products, which is a step further than we want to go. The European Parliament clearly wants a more radical option. That brings me back to what is

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
practicable, what is enforceable and what is proportionate. Looking at the cost in the regulatory impact assessment, when one goes to that very radical point where products as well as derived process materials are brought in, enforcement of these proposals becomes very costly, as does compliance with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union documents No. 11576/01, draft Council Regulation on genetically modified food and feed, and No. 11496/01, draft Council Regulation on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms; and supports the Government's aim of securing practical, proportionate and enforceable legislation that also recognises the external impact, including that on developing countries.—[	<i>Ms Blears.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good question session with the Minister. Four broad areas of concern have emerged. The first is enforcement: its effectiveness, whether this is, to some extent, an invitation to fraud, and what the costs to business would be if enforcement action were to take place against the background of stringent provisions of the sort that the Commission suggests. That concern would be even greater if the European Parliament's amendments were to become part of the final outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I described the European Parliament's measures as draconian. The Minister said that that might not be quite the right word, and she may be correct, but they are certainly radical—to accept her word—and they go a long way down what we would say is the wrong road of making a statement by having strong regulation, but without providing something that is verifiable or that would mean very much to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area of concern addresses the role of the European food authority, and how it will work. The third concern is the thresholds, and the fourth is the effect on third countries and whether this whole process is WTO-compliant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I start with a general observation. These measures seem to centralise in a substantial manner the way in which we will be authorising the various GMO products, and it is unclear to me what effect this will have on the overall European balance between decisions being taken by a member state and decisions being taken centrally by European institutions. Can the Minister give us an overview as to how this stacks up against the principle of subsidiarity and the overall context of the matter? In some other recent debates in the Committee there has been a move towards a more centralised structure. We are always cautious about that—and on the last occasion the Minister was, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also take into account the background of a fast-moving scientific culture. Knowledge in this field is constantly developing, and new reports are frequently produced. The protagonists on one side of the argument say, "The science is this," and those on the other side say, "The science is that." The Committee that was tasked with looking into this area said that we needed a debate. Therefore, I seek reassurance from the Minister about these particular authorisations. They last for 10 years, and derogated products—products that already exist—are given a nine-year period before they must renew, and when a product is renewed it is renewed for 10 years. Those are long periods. If the science changed, and immediate concerns developed as a result of a change in the way in which science was perceived, would it be possible to suspend or modify the authorisations that had been given? If so, on what grounds would that be done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the European Parliament's decision would be to subject 30,000 products that contain GMO-derived ingredients, and that are not restricted in any way, to labelling requirements. What would be the effect of that in terms of enforcement, given that many of the end products are analytically indistinguishable from material from non-GM sources? The scale of the change would be enormous and would go far beyond what is disclosed in the Commission proposals, and even the worst-case scenario in the report. Under the worst-case scenario, it was thought that the cost to businesses would be £1.6 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The table following paragraph 3.12 of the scrutiny report shows that the cost of the Commission proposal plus the cost of covering products produced from GMOs would be 1.588 billion. Given that that is the worst-case scenario, and that the Minister says that that would not be the full cost, what will be the cost of the European Parliament proposals as amended? Are the labelling rules practical and proportionate'? There are already labelling requirements in respect of ingredients and so on. Given that the rules will go that much further, will they fit in with the present labelling requirements; if so, how would that work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will not the consumer want to know which products have the least GM involvement? Many consumers might like products to be GM-free, but if it were not possible to get to that state of perfect grace, they would then choose a product with very little GM-involvement at all—one that contained some GM ingredient that it was not even possible to detect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
scientifically. Is not the European Parliament saying that even a product with the most minimal involvement with GMOs would have to have a label saying "containing GM ingredients"? If that is so, would consumers be misled? When they looked at the products, all they would see would be the label saying, "containing GM ingredients", and even though one product might have hardly any GM involvement, and another might be almost entirely GM, there would be no way of telling the difference. Is that not against consumer choice to a considerable extent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made the point that fraud will be a temptation if one cannot verify what has happened. We support GM labelling, but we would like it to be truly verifiable and would like to allow consumers a real choice. We believe that the proposals, as amended by the European Parliament, could mislead consumers and lead to large-scale fraud. We also think that consumers should be able to make choices with the maximum scientifically valid information available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On enforcement problems, we would like to know what the cost will be and how many businesses will be affected, and I hope that the Minister will confirm the various points that I have raised. To what extent will the measures fall disproportionately on small business? I have asked some questions about the European food authority, but the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Lord Whitty, said in his remarks to the Scrutiny Committee that the Government have
	<br><blockquote><p>"strong reservations about the proposed approach for safety assessment, in as much as the type of scientific committee which might be involved is not specified".</p></blockquote>
Are the Government flagging up a worry that the committee might not be genuinely scientific or that the personnel who serve on it might be wrong? What problem with the scientific committee have the Government identified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the scientific justification for a threshold? Is it possible to check for 0.5 per cent. adventitious contamination at the moment? Is the science or mechanism available to check at that low level? Are the Government satisfied with the threshold approach that has been adopted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the effect on third countries, will the unique identification codes be consistent with the OECD approach? That point was made earlier. What will be the external impact of the labelling requirements on developing countries, and has an assessment of that been conducted? What has been done to check whether the process, which could be seen as erecting barriers to developing countries, is compliant with the WTO approach? It is notable that Lord Whitty talks about the possible cost of a trade dispute. Is that because the Government believe that the measure might not be WTO compliant and that a trade dispute is likely? If so, with whom would we have the dispute, and what would its extent and cost be? If we are to have a set-to with the Americans—as we are in other areas—that could be very costly, and it could have a substantive effect on world trade and the world's prosperity. We have seen that before during trade disputes between Europe and the USA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The amendments in the European Parliament were tabled by non-Conservatives: the Greens and the Liberals. I understand that British Labour MEPs did not vote at all. Is the Minister satisfied with the approach of her colleagues in the European Parliament? The UK Government have put forward a very specific position, so how can Labour MEPs not back that up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Committees have been getting rather consensual of late, but the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) has made several political points so let me respond in like fashion. In 1999, the Conservative party proposed a five-year moratorium on field trials for GM crops. All the research that he says we need to gather information would not have started for another two years if we had gone down that line. Although I do not support my Labour colleagues' actions of abstaining in the European Parliament debate, I shall not have them lectured by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I shall make a few comments that I suspect will find more favour on the Opposition Benches than with my hon. Friends. I have always supported GM technology. Two recent authoritative reports—one published by the World Wide Fund for Nature, which came out today, I think, and another from a scientific committee of the United States Government—show that we are using our planet's resources at an unsustainable rate. A crisis is coming in terms of the raw materials that we use, the food that we produce, the energy that we use and the way in which we deal with our atmosphere, with regard to such problems as greenhouse gases. Many of those crises can be prevented only by deploying technologies that we develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Genetic modification is one such key technology which we must deploy to offset the crises. It will have huge economic benefits. I know that people who are against genetic modification will say that that means people making more money, but I am afraid that I am not against people making a living, and if economic benefits are to be had and some are passed to consumers, I am all for it. Let us not forget that many GMO products that the legislation will affect reduce energy consumption because less energy is consumed by their production. They reduce chemical use on fields. They reduce greenhouse gas production, as we do not have to till soils to the same extent. There are many potential benefits for the third world in deploying such technology. I do not suggest that such benefits will automatically accrue. Political decisions and guidance will be necessary to reap all the benefits of GM technology, but we must exploit its potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting into the most awful muddle by drawing what I regard as a false distinction between GM and other products. For example, there is a strain of pea that is grown because it produces its own insecticide, so not so much insecticide is necessary to grow it. It was developed not with GM technology but with a perfectly ordinary ancient process of plant breeding, and it brings economic benefits. Are we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
going to label that product as having been produced from an insecticide-producing pea? Of course not. People will eat it tonight in the Members' Tea Room without even questioning what variety of pea they have on their plate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I once worked with a scientist who identified a brand of potato that defeated insect attack by having sticky hairs growing out of the stem so the insects could not walk up it. The problem was that the potatoes tasted like—urgh. To the best of my knowledge, no one ever managed, using old-fashioned techniques, to put that stem on a potato that tasted delicious. If anyone had been able to do so, it would have been a great step forward. GM technology could do that tomorrow. If it can do that and produce a major step forward so that we no longer have to treat our potatoes with insecticide, why not exploit that and give people the opportunity to do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow, and sympathise and empathise with, many of the hon. Gentleman's points. Will he consider the implications of labelling packs of tomatoes "Subject to biological control agents", which are perfectly natural control mechanisms, thus obviating the need for pesticides?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the old days, when someone managed to produce a new variety of plant through old-fashioned production techniques such as cross-breeding, that person would have to grow the plant, collect the seed, grow the seed and collect more seed, and it would be a long time before there was a commercial crop. About 20 or 25 years ago, we developed a technique whereby we take the first plant, break it down into its cells and grow the cells in tissue culture, and a commercial crop can be produced from that one plant in a few months. Practically everything that we eat tonight will have been produced on that basis. Yet we are going to take an anti-science view of GM products just because we find them a bit difficult to cope with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the regulation that the European Parliament proposes, and something that comes from a GM product, even though it contains no GM material itself, will have to be labelled in future, on what principle will we do that? The principle seems to be that the original GM product might have some harmful effects. We know that the one that we are selling does not have any harmful effects, but we shall label it as though it does anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we going to follow that to its logical conclusion? If the Minister eats a green tomato tonight, she will be very sick, but the process of ripening that tomato destroys the toxin in it, and the red tomato is perfectly harmless. Is she going to place a label on every tomato in every supermarket that says, "This comes from a poisonous unripe fruit"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lectin in red kidney beans of which small microgram quantities are more than enough to kill everyone in the Room. It is denatured when kidney beans are cooked. Is the Minister going to label every can or serving of chilli con came on sale as coming
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
from a poisonous stock? Rhubarb leaves are poisonous, but its stems are not. We know about that. If we were to label meat on the basis of what the animals had eaten, there would be some very unpleasant labelling because animals eat some very unsavoury things. We are not proposing to mention those on our labels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to take the attitude that we have to have special arrangements for GM products. In my view, the necessity for those special arrangements has come about as a result of a misunderstanding of the science and the technology. My advice to the Minister and the Government is, in devising the new framework, to keep it simple. If we end up with a regulatory process that is the equivalent needed to put a medical drug on to the market, the technology will never go anywhere. We must keep the process simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of a system of labelling that divides the information that consumers get into three broad bands. I am quite happy with ethical information being provided on labels. However, the Minister justified her stance to me by saying that people have strong views on GM technology. I put it to her that people have strong views on the use of animal products in their food. I do not share those views, but many of my constituents do not want to touch anything with animal products in it. Animal products are used in the production of most red wine. To the best of my knowledge, the Co-op is still the only retailer that insists that the labels of red wine produced with animal products contain that information. The Minister is not going to insist that the label "This product uses animal materials" be put on every bottle of red wine. Having strongly held views is not a justification for Government action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keep the process simple. By all means, include ethical information, known health risks and origins—whether something is organic or from a GM product—on the label, but keep it simple. Only by keeping the label simple will we ensure that consumers have information that they can understand. We will then give GM technology the opportunity that it needs to produce the benefits that I think society must look for in the coming years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) gave a truly excellent exposition, and I warmed to every word that he said. He displayed considerable knowledge and understanding of the science in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try initially to follow up one of the themes that he advanced. We have some precedent on the way in which we inform consumers about matters connected with genetic modification. Before certain newspapers coined the phrase "Frankenstein foods", Sainsbury's and Safeway had put on sale a tomato paste made from genetically modified tomatoes. It was an outstanding commercial success. Customers liked it and bought lots of it. It tasted better than before. I, as a Member of Parliament, received no letters of complaint from anyone who had purchased or consumed that product. Then, for some reason, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
supermarkets were suddenly frightened of putting on a proper label that said that the product was made from genetically modified contents, and took it off the shelves. They were panicked by a campaign that was not objectively based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compliment the Minister, while she grapples with some of the complexities of the science, on her words of common sense which reflected the explanatory memorandums put out in connection with the debate, which recognised that there is still a practical chasm to be crossed if the whole field is not to become a lawyers' paradise. Going back to the tomato paste, that was an example of an open declaration allowing consumers freedom of choice. In reality, they liked what was on offer. Since we have had an irrational discussion on the matter, that element of consumer choice has disappeared altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that we are discussing is almost a theoretical situation, save for food imported into the European Union, on which the discussion is very relevant. As hon. Members who have contributed to the debate so far have indicated, there is a heavy commitment to GM crops in the United States, in soya bean production, for example. In the United States—a country that is highly conscious of food safety and in which litigation abounds—we have seen a general acceptance of that technology. No great public health issues have arisen and, so far, no major areas of litigation have resulted. American consumers are well advised of what is available, and they have a great deal of choice. Because of the stance taken in the European Union that we cannot have even commercial plantings of genetically modified crops, we cannot enjoy the next stage products produced in the European Union from indigenous production of genetically modified materials. It is quite possible that foods as defined by the directive could be produced here by the use of GM ingredients brought in from outside the EU. That is rather odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to look briefly at the inverse of that situation. We focus on the requirement to tell consumers clearly about a particular characteristic, either of the product or food on offer or, in the case of farmers, of the feed that they give to their animals. Why are we giving that information? What is the reasoning for it? We already have ingredients lists—that is required. We seem to want to give that information because collectively we feel that there is public concern. What are the public concerned about? What lies behind their concern about GM foods? I think that it is a question of the unknown, worry about the science and perhaps a question about the safety of the food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not require certain information on our labelling. If the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes—which I gather from what the Minister said earlier will still have a part to play in dealing with such matters—agrees that a functional food such as Benecol is okay, we do not have a counterbalancing statement on the packet that says, "This product has been approved by the Food Standards Agency's Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes. It has looked very hard at the science and says that this
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
is safe for you to eat. Tick in the box." Most interestingly, the committee's chairman, Professor Bainbridge, has made it clear that she would prefer to have a product made from genetically modified substances for exactly the reasons given by the hon. Member for South Thanet. In the natural world, there are substances that go into our food that may pose a toxic threat far greater than anything from a genetic modification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know far more about a product that is made from a genetically modified substance because we have made it. However, we do not put that information as a positive assurance on our food. We are invited to agree to a labelling regime that leaves many questions unanswered—perhaps for negative reasons. Putting that information on the packaging may tell the consumer something, but it does not answer the subsequent questions that come as a result of that information being available. If we are to have proper labelling, it is about time that we coupled it with proper information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has heard reference to matters raised by the National Farmers Union, and I think many of its concerns parallel those of the Minister. On scientific analysis and traceability, huge questions remain unanswered. That is why I pursued my line of questioning in looking at, for example, what we mean in defining products and why I raised the practical question whether burgers would be incorporated in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would assist me in answering a question that was not answered but hangs in the ether of the Committee: what actually happens in the context of the restaurant trade? Somewhere in my dim and distant memory, I remember that there is a requirement to declare on menus that there may be some genetically modified ingredients in the items. However, that leaves the question hanging. Some 40 per cent. of our food spend is now outside the home, and I get the clear impression from the regulations that they are far more exacting about packaged products—and require declaratory label information—than they are about the 40 per cent. of product that is eaten off the menu without any information given on the ingredients that are available. If we can sanction 40 per cent. of our food spend in an information-free zone, why are we concentrating so hard on the 60 per cent. that may result from manufacturing activity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to endorse what the Minister said about the difficulties of scientific analysis. If one were to batch-test all the ingredients that came into Britain, what resources would be available in this country, for example, for carrying out a full scientific analysis and fulfilling traceability requirements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The American Soybean Association sent information to members of the Committee thoroughly probing traceability and the requirement for having information at many stages in a complex chain. I would be interested to know whether any officials have actually been to the United States and followed the distribution chain of American soya beans, worked out how documentation and sampling would operate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
and dealt with the questions that the American Soybean Association asked: why must data be kept for five years? In what form is it to be kept? Why five years? I envisage a minefield in this subject, unless identity preservation is the route chosen for so-called GM-free products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I associate myself with some of the very telling points that have been made about the nature of GM-free products. I am beginning to think, particularly in the context of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, that the European Parliament has happened on a rather subtle way of effectively banning GM imports by making a regulatory requirement so incredibly difficult that no one would want to send such products into the European Union. Again, as has been mentioned, the United States may take action under the WTO dispute provisions to challenge such a requirement. It would make steel look like a side-show, given the size of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great many terms have not been satisfactorily defined. The NFU rightly drew attention to the fact that "GM free" has not been properly defined. The European Parliament saying that 0.5 per cent. is better than 0.6, 0.4 or 1 per cent. is dancing on the head of a pin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by associating myself with the hon. Member for South Thanet. We must be practical about the information but, equally, the Government must be robust in ensuring that the declaration that a product contains a genetically modified organism is not a signal that in some way it is less safe than food produced by any other mechanism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to take part in the debate. I have enormous respect and regard for my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet and for the right hon. Member for Fylde, who is a fellow member of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee. They are kindred spirits, and I shall make common cause with them on the reassessment of nuclear power, which is long overdue in this country. However, when they are wrong, as they are in this case—100 per cent. wrong—I shall say so and make no apology for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, they demonstrate the classic case of producing evidence without knowing the questions. It is a fundamental mistake to pretend that the public are wrong in this area and that it will all come right in the light of day with a little more scientific explanation and a little more persuasion on behalf of a wonderful industry that has got it all right and knows exactly what will be good for us. That will not happen. For one reason or another, the public have made up their mind on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked forward to the debate. It is a great pity that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon is not here, because by putting down the amendment, which we cannot discuss because he has not moved it, he has drawn attention to the excellent report that we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
produced. In so doing, he also highlights the need for a proper debate before we draw a conclusion. Both my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet and the right hon. Member for Fylde have drawn that conclusion but do not want to have a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misdirected himself. He cannot discuss the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, but he can raise it himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for drawing that to my attention, Mr. Hurst. I do not want to spend long on the amendment, but it is useful that that point has been made, because the report said that we must at least try to go through the process of having a consensual debate. It will be difficult because the opposing forces are entrenched, but that does not mean that everybody is entrenched. One may be able to draw from that debate some facts that need to be highlighted to establish clarity on the issue, which is why today's debate is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether I fully understand the Government's stance, nor what the Commission has been saying; I only know what I have read about the European Parliament's subsequent action. In many respects, I welcome what it did because it further hardened the approach to the matter, but it has not gone far enough. I believe, perhaps naively, that there is such a thing as a GM-free product, and the public are looking for such products. Today's press release from the Food Standards Agency poured scorn on many of the labels that the public are expected to read and understand, and says that labels should be much clearer. We could achieve that by stating that food is GM free, rather than trying to limit or graduate genetically modified products. As the right hon. Member for Fylde alluded to, that is like arguing about how many angels can dance on the point of a pin. We should both mean and do what we say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple fact is that I disagree with the Minister. At the moment, there is no shortage of food in the world; the problem is the control of its supply. The debate is being used as an opportunity to redraw the basis of the power that lies behind the production of food, which will not help the third world. Unlike many hon. Members, I have talked to producers from Brazil and India who feel that they are being forced to take the GM road regardless of whether they think that it is right. If they do not take that road, they are shut out of markets. Whatever one's views about the scientific merit of the process, let us not fool ourselves that anything other than economic power lies behind the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to tease the Minister about being able to define one door and one key, but I would put the matter more bluntly than that. To my mind, one large American boot is being put into the door on the basis that the United States wants to kick it open. The debate is about opening up the WTO to allow GMOs to be made fully available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am truly grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Does he recall the evidence that Marks and Spencer gave to our inquiry into GMOs, in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
it pointed out that it was procuring a supply of non-GM product from Brazil? In supplying that sector of the market, Marks and Spencer provided an opportunity to the country about which he has spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember that evidence. The question is how much longer Brazil can remain GM free. One question that is never answered concerns the degree to which cross-contamination will occur. My only reason for supporting farm-scale trials—I shall not pre-empt the evidence, because that would be unscientific and lack objectivity—is that all that I have seen and heard suggests that the one challenge that can never be answered is the likelihood of cross-contamination. That is why I return to the basic, naïve point of view that if a product is GM free I know what it is and consumers know what it is, but it cannot be made so, given the way in which we are redefining agricultural production. That is why our debate is so basic and fundamental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to have a real debate with my hon. Friend. Perhaps he can answer two questions. First, how does a varietal change brought about by genetic modification differ from a varietal change brought about by traditional cross-breeding techniques? Secondly, what evidence does he have that the economic pressures on the third world to take plants and crops bred in the developed world by old techniques are any different from the economic pressures being put on them today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Drew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the second question first. The answer is: only from what people tell me and by engaging in debate. There seems to be a difference because of the centralisation of the biotech industry, which is fundamentally different from the whole history of plant breeding and has inevitably grown more concentrated. Anyone who watched the series of programmes about the biotech industry on BBC2 on Sundays recently saw how the industry tried to corner scientific knowledge by employing the best brains and marketing its products so effectively that it took out all competition and opposition. That was the only way in which it could make good its huge investment. I am suspicious of that. I may be wrong and the people involved may be altruistic, but the all evidence that has come to my attention suggests that that is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's first question, I shall not try, as a non-scientist, to outwit his greater knowledge. All I shall say is that, again, the evidence that I have seen suggests that the fundamental difference is that it is very difficult to reverse the movement of genetic modification and the basic ways in which we are defining plants, in terms not just of their final product but of the processes. That is why consumers are worried about the scientific justification and the economic power behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am arguing is that we should have the debate. What is wrong with that? It will not be easy. I have been horrified, as have other speakers in this debate, at some of the extreme comments from both sides of the argument. They do not help the debate, but we must have the debate and take it forward—we have spoken
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
rather theoretically today. Whatever the Government do, let alone the Commission with its accountability to the European Parliament, we must stand up to those forces and ensure that the debate takes place before coming to any conclusions. The public will be even more angry and certain that they do not want genetic modification is if they believe that the debate will never be held and that genetic modification will be allowed to enter the food chain regardless of their right to say no. That is all that consumers can do. It has been suggested that some consumers might want to say yes, but if they want to say no and eat non-GM food, they should have that right. People are worried about the manipulation with which scientific processes are going ahead and, more seriously, the way in which the debate is being almost pushed aside. We shall rue the day if we get this wrong. If we are not open and transparent to consumers, they will feel that decisions have been taken away from them, which will have all sorts of repercussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why we do not introduce product liability legislation first. I would be much happier were that to happen. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) said, it should be clear that the-polluter-pays principle will be exacted; clear product liability legislation would have to be in place for that, so that if the industry gets it wrong it can be held back from more extreme positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always seem to be playing catch up. A door is always being pushed open against us, whether it be the threat of the WTO or the threat to countries in the third world, which have been told that they must have GM seeds or nothing else will be supplied. Product liability legislation is therefore crucial, and I hope that the Minister will comment on that specifically. We have many reasons to listen to consumers and have a debate. We may then reach a different view—although I, for one, am not sure that that will ever happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) made some excellent and pertinent points. I take a slightly different view however from the hon. Member for South Thanet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always concerned when people say, "I am a GM supporter". It cuts short any argument or debate—they have already announced that they think that GM is a good thing. I would not say that I am a GM supporter or a GM detractor. A new product must be considered and evaluated. It is wrong to assume that because it is new it will automatically be beneficial. It is particularly wrong to brand anyone who raises concerns and asks questions as anti-science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of GM seems to be the pet of hon. Member for South Thanet—it ought to be better trained. There are many reasons why people will not buy GM produce. They may think that there is a health risk—I do not necessarily believe that it represents
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
much of a health risk. People will not buy meat because they do not like the killing of animals and some people will not buy GM produce because they do not want the risk of its impact on the environment. They might be worried about the impact on biodiversity. On new produce and its impact, there is a big difference between the plains of the American mid-west and the valleys and coombs of Devon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public have every right to be sceptical. They have been misled too many times in the past. It is only right and proper that politicians in Europe and in this House should be cautious and consider the matter in detail so that they can give the public true choice. Choice is about variety. One of my concerns about GM produce is that it will eventually lead to a lack of variety because dominant varieties, such as one type of tomato, will emerge. I like different types of tomato, and I like my food. I like to eat different things. I do not want to find that only one tasteless brand of tomato is available in the supermarket, because of the cost of production and the way in which products are marketed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have said during the debate that I support GM. However, I have also supported the work of people who produce crops through integrated crop management and organic production. As a keen allotmenteer, I take a keen interest in a variety of production methods. I want diversity too, but I am prepared to support new technology—just not at the expense of everything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his clarification. I hope that he accepts that some of the concerns that people have about GM may be well founded. However, I apologise if I have misrepresented him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain what the method of achieving a varietal change in a species has to do with the ecological impact of that variety when it is planted? The ecological impact of a variety of crop is to do with the properties of that crop, not whether it has been produced by old-fashioned, plant-breeding techniques or by modern GM techniques.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but old-fashioned husbandry techniques change things gradually. New techology does not. It makes changes in leaps and bounds. It is right and proper for people to be concerned about that. We have not got to the bottom of it, but there were leaps and bounds in how we render meat and the BSE crisis may have been the result, although that still has to be proven. Action taken in leaps and bounds produces results that we do not necessarily want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us return to the main substance of the debate to which the Minister will be responding. Concern has been expressed about the proposals. Although we on the Liberal-Democrat Benches support them in general, some questions must be asked. Labelling is particularly important. It is no good having only two
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
labels, one saying that the product "contains GM" and one that says "GM-free". There should be more variety. Producers should be encouraged to say whether products are 10 per cent. GM, 20 per cent. GM or whatever, so that the public understand the quantity and the nature of the GM produce that is in the product. Labels must be clear and concise. These days, we almost need a PhD in science or nutrition to read labels. I become confused when working out what products contain, as I am sure do most other hon. Members. Therefore, GM-free should mean GM-free. If there are any residues, they should be as small as possible. Thus, I hope that the matter of 1 per cent. or 0.5 per cent. will remain open, so that the percentage can be reduced to the finest, not the fattest, point of a pin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really believe that "organic" means purely organic, or should that description also carry some warning because of cross-pollination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Labels should show the correct description. If products cannot be guaranteed to be 100 per cent. organic, that should be specified on the label. I am not in favour of misrepresentation. It makes the public cynical about what is being presented to them. We must be open and honest, not slightly misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying not that products should be labelled "GM-free" or "GM-possibly" or "definitely-GM", but that we should be saying 19, 29 or 30 per cent. GM. How on earth can that be enforced? He represents a constituency that is not dissimilar to mine. How will he sell such an idea to farmers' markets and women's institute markets? It would put them out of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses my point. I am suggesting that percentages would be better for the public. I am not saying that such legislation should be enforced. A label that states that the food contains GM products would be adequate. If we only end up with two products and one is GM free and the other contains a majority of GM products, the public will be confused about what they are eating. I want to encourage manufacturers and producers to put more information on to product labels. The public have shown much interest in such labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that with European legislation comes a paper chase and enforcement throughout the EU. Time and again, legislation is introduced and implemented more strictly in the UK than elsewhere. I welcome the fact that a central unit will control such matters. It should help to ensure that enforcement and labelling are the same throughout the EU. I ask the Minister to consider that, as well as the paper chase, and the amount of paperwork that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On adding to the work load of farmers, DEFRA already produces forms that are far too complex and exacting for small family businesses to complete, and if they get something minutely wrong, they are penalized
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
much more severely than is reasonable. I hope that this paperwork will be implemented in such a way as to avoid that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the cost to farmers and the way in which the documentation comes in. I am particularly concerned that small farmers will have to face the costs of testing. The Minister indicated that that would be the case. I ask her to look at that again, to find out whether there are ways of dealing with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about the impact on small farmers in the third world, to which the Minister referred. I would hate to think that a mechanism that should protect those producers might put them out of business because they cannot pay for the testing costs and the documentation. I want the Minister to ask the EU to consider how to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to respond to the wide variety of questions that have been raised. In the four weeks that I have held this post I have been on a fairly steep learning curve, especially in relation to the science that is involved. I have enjoyed this debate, and some of the issues that have been raised have led me to want to find out more about the practicalities of what this means for communities, as well as to tackle the purely administrative process with which we are dealing. Therefore, I look forward to appearing in front of the Committee again, when I will perhaps have a little more background knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised a general point about the balance of decision-making power. We recently discussed the herbal medicines directive. We debated the difference between a centralised approval procedure and one that is based in member states, and how to get the right balance in the relationship between them. Although this directive's proposal is for the European food safety agency to have a role, it will not be an exclusive role: it will draw on the skills, talents and experience of the member states, which have been built up over the years by their scientific committees. The decision about authorisation will also remain with member states; it will be for them to decide whether authorisation should be granted for use across the EU, although that decision will be made on the basis of qualified majority voting. Therefore, once again, there will be a coming together, and a balance of power in decision-making between the central organisation and the different scientific committees that operate at present in member states. However, I acknowledge that this directive proposes to take that approval process closer to the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. members mentioned the way the science is developing: if the science changes, is there provision to withdraw, suspend or revoke authorisation? I can reassure them that the answer is, "Yes, there is." If new information calls into question a safety assessment, a product could be withdrawn. That is an important safeguard for consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Reference has been made to enforcement, the possibility of fraud, and the costs of enforcement. As I explained, four options were set out in the RIA, with the approximate costs—and it must be said that they are very approximate costs—with regard to the effect on business. We set out the costs of segregation of crops and traceability. As I understand it, the European Parliament has voted for the Commission proposals, together with a reduction in the threshold to 0.5 per cent., and it has not supported the extension of the threshold into the non-EU approved 14 crops that are waiting to go through the process. Therefore, it has chosen option C—or the third option—for which the figure is about £720 million, together with the enforcement costs that were identified by my hon. Friend Lord Whitty of about £6 million for inspection and sampling. However, enforcement costs could clearly be greater than that, although how high they would be would depend on what action needs to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned the view that is taken of these matters by the World Trade Organisation and third countries. I understand that the Commission has notified the WTO of its proposal. The proposal has attracted comments from several countries and the Commission is responding to them. It is too early to discuss proceedings in the WTO, particularly as the proposals are not yet in force, but we are working hard to ensure that the final rules will be proportionate and that we shall not face proceedings in the WTO on restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked whether science is capable of reducing the threshold from 1 per cent. to the proposed 0.5 per cent. level. I understand that at present the threshold throughout Europe is 1 per cent. No country goes below that level. Existing detection methods can enforce that threshold, but they cannot reliably measure at 0.5 per cent. That measurement might be possible for some products in certain circumstances, but not necessarily for the whole range of products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure me that the Council of Ministers will discuss an equivalence of enforcement and analysis throughout the European Union? Several countries might have sophisticated techniques while those in other countries could be less sophisticated. Given that we have a single market, people might choose the easier door of entry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point about variations of analysis and enforcement. It is important to have consistent standards in both those areas for international trade, and I shall ensure that those issues are properly taken up. I hope that member states will share technology. Countries in which technology is better developed could share that among all of us who have an interest in ensuring that the analysis is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned the catering sector and burgers, although I am not sure whether he thought that both necessarily go together. If restaurants in the UK sell products containing GM foods, they are required to notify that fact. The proposals will require such labelling throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
European Union. Our position will not change, but there must be consistency throughout the European Union to require restaurant outlets to label food in such a way. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the proposals would cover burgers. Yes, they will, if any ingredients are obtained from a GMO or if the burgers contain soya protein. Article 15 refers to the separate issue of packaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contributions to the debate showed that there are strong views on both sides of the House. Hon. Members raised important points about consumers being able to access good-quality information that allows them to make informed choices. At the same time, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet made an extremely interesting argument about the differences between conventional hybridisation and the GM process. It will be important to get further information about the different content of products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also said that we should not take an anti-science view. It is important that the wider debate that will be launched has a rigorous science base for two reasons. First, we must ensure that we get the right information and, secondly, as the report by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee says, we must rebuild public confidence in using science as a public policy issue. That is an important recommendation that we shall take forward. I am sure that hon. Members who do not share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet are not anti-science and will welcome that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud made the important point that there is public demand and that we should listen to consumers. He also discussed whether we could get product liability in place before proceeding with the proposals. I do not think that there will necessarily be a direct read across to implications for product liability, but we must
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
examine the international position. GM crops are traded internationally and we must try to ensure that we do not end up with legislation that is out of kilter with product liability legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge made an important point about the effect on small businesses. There is a regulatory impact assessment that considers small businesses in particular, because many of the catering establishments employ fewer than 10 employees, and many bakery outlets are small businesses. We must be mindful of the burdens of extra paper audit trails and regulatory systems on those companies, but that must be balanced with safety and consumer information. He made an important point about the effect of the proposals on developing countries. We do not want the proposals to act as a barrier preventing developing countries from opening up trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered all the matters that hon. Members raised. It is important that we get the right balance of safety and information, and that the proposals that the Government support are practical, enforceable and proportionate. I ask all hon. Members to support the motion. We will continue to negotiate with our partners and to try to ensure that whatever the eventual outcome of the legislation, it can be enforced properly and practically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
