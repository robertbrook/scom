	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by saying that it is nice to see you in the Chair, Miss Begg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good run-through on the issue of total allowable catches and quotas. I remind the Committee that we managed to secure a full-day debate in December before the December Council. We also had the opportunity, thanks to the Scrutiny Committee, to debate the Green Paper on the common fisheries policy review, which is of interest to all hon. Members. I welcome the opportunity to scrutinise total allowable catches and quotas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members may have thought that they would be able to discuss details of the European Commission's proposals on the common fisheries policy, because we expected those proposals to be ready last Wednesday. We heard that they were delayed and might appear tomorrow, but they will not appear tomorrow and may not be made public until May. However, they will be available for debate for the June Council, and hon. Members should have the opportunity to see them before that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Winterton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Congleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No interventions. There will be an opportunity to ask questions after the Minister's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Miss Begg. It is my natural courtesy that led me to respond. I assure the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton), however, that I intend to keep my remarks brief, which will allow hon. Members to ask questions in the time allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a great deal for me to add to the points that I have raised, because hon. Members are aware of the outcome of the December Council and of the proposals for total allowable catches and quotas. The outcome of the December Council was a good and fair one. Although we had disagreements with the Commission, which pursued cuts in quota that went beyond the recommendations of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the scientific advice, when the Commission followed the scientific advice, we accepted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an unfortunate history of people arguing above the scientific advice in an attempt to obtain extra quota. That is a dangerous position to take and one that has led to problems, because it creates a slippery slope in relation to sustainability. Even when recommendations are difficult, we must support them, as the industry accepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We involved the industry in setting the total allowable catches and quotas. The industry put reasonable and well argued points of view and we put its arguments strongly to the Council. One such argument related to the quota on nephrops, which is important in relation to the North sea and the Irish sea. Many hon. Members here today raised that issue with me on behalf of their local fishing fleets and were pleased with the overall outcome, which recognised the pressure on stocks but recognised too that we had put the case for the industry when there was a case to argue on a recommendation that the Commission did not have the science to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the Commission's proposals were right even when they went beyond the science. I understand the Commission's thinking about stocks caught as a by-catch within the main stocks under pressure, especially cod and hake. However, it is necessary to recognise the effects on the industry. We have to take the industry with us, and approach those issues in a proportionate way, based on science and sometimes also on the precautionary principle. That was the general approach that we took at the December Council, and the outcome was good for the fishing industry, bearing in mind that a lot of fish stocks are under severe pressure. Indeed, many fish stocks are below their safe biological limits. That is why the next stage is to work with the industry on the recovery programmes, particularly for cod and hake, to try to get those stocks into better shape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the debate further, we could talk about the idea of multi-annual quotas in order to bring some stability by setting quotas over a number of years. Those debates are yet to come. The common fisheries policy proposals are important, and will guide those debates. The detail of the recovery programmes is also important. We have gone to great pains to involve the fishing industry in the negotiations and in the decision-making process, and we have given it access to the Department at all times. We value the industry's input and the contact that we have had with it, and we look forward to hearing the Commission's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am hopeful that the Commission has listened carefully to the excellent case that our industry has made on such things as introducing a more regional dimension to the common fisheries policy, and also to the Government's case for more decentralisation and flexibility. Hon. Members will have the opportunity to discuss the details in due course. I look forward to that and to the ongoing debate, which should result in a reformed, more flexible, realistic and effective common fisheries policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister been able to compare the draft Council regulation establishing the specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep sea stocks, and the equivalent draft Council regulation establishing a recovery programme for cod and hake that he has just mentioned? Does he acknowledge the similarities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
between the two as management tools, and does he agree that that could point the way and that it might show the future shape of management under the common fisheries policy after 2002?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the final question is not necessarily. We have to look at different stocks and consider the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Deep sea stocks are under enormous pressure, and the subject will be mentioned at the June Council. We believe that the traditional methods of stock conservation—quotas and TACs—are not necessarily right for deep sea stock. Our concern is that they will not reduce pressure, nor will they reduce the by-catch on deep water stocks. We would much prefer a more effort-control oriented approach to deep sea stock management than TACs and quotas, although they do have a role to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the recovery programmes, there is still a debate to be had. We have agreed an increase in mesh sizes, but we did not move right away to the 120 mm mesh size that the Commission argued for in the North sea because we need to give the industry time to adjust. I know that my hon. Friends who represent east coast constituencies feel strongly on that point on behalf of the industry, and we acknowledged that in our negotiations. A move towards a bigger mesh size is the right way forward because there is a real problem with by-catch of small and unmarketable fish, particularly in the North sea. We need to reduce that, and more selective gear and a larger mesh will help, and the result will be bigger fish—and, incidentally, better quality fish—and the possibility of better prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to you, Miss Begg, in your new role and wish you every success in future. You are no stranger to fishing debates and I am sure that you appreciate the different perspectives. Given the Minister's acknowledgment of the significance of the North sea to the UK industry, will he explain where we have got to in our ongoing, virtually perpetual discussions with the Norwegians?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to a range of joint-management stocks, including herring, we have reached a conclusion with the EU-Norwegian agreement. We still have some disagreement with the Norwegians and with Iceland and the Faroes over the allocation of deep water species and the quota that should be set for that. The EU has set a precautionary quota within EU waters, and it is right to do that, but there is still a problem with the quota in international waters. I am surprised at the level of quota for which Norway, Iceland and the Faroes are arguing. It is not sustainable and is way above the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommendations. We will have to debate those issues not only bilaterally with Norway but within the North Atlantic Fisheries Commission. The present situation is not satisfactory and we have more work to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations on your new position as Chair, Miss Begg. It is a pleasure to serve under you, particularly as it is the first time that such a debate has been chaired by
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
someone who knows as much as the rest of us about this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question relates to the Minister's opening remark about the framework in which TACs are set—the common fisheries policy. There has been a very unwelcome delay in the publication of the road map for future discussion before the end of the year and in the resolution of the important discussions that are needed. Can he shed any light on information that I have received on very good authority that that is a result of high level representations made by the Prime Minister of Spain, Mr. Aznar, to Romano Prodi? Spain and other countries object to proposals in the draft common fisheries policy to withdraw modernisation grants and for related matters. Six countries have formed the group Friends of Fish and are actively working against the general direction of the common fisheries policy, to which I understood that all other countries had agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman may be aware, the progress or time scale of the negotiations is a matter for the Commission. I cannot say what has caused the delay or tell him the details of representations received by the Commission. However, I can tell him that in the Green Paper there was a strong recommendation from the Commission to end public subsidy for the building of fishing boats. It is no secret that that is opposed by countries such as Spain and France and other countries that have signed up to Friends of Fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the acknowledged problems of pressure on fish stocks and the overcapacity of the EU fleet, I would question the rationale and the sense behind subsidising the building of new fishing vessels, which inevitably increases catching power and pressure on fish stocks, at a time such as this. It does not make sense and the UK strongly supports the Commission on the issue. There are those who argue that public subsidy of increased effort is the way forward and call themselves the Friends of Fish. With friends like that, fish do not need enemies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the onward agenda for Community enlargement, will the Minister tell us how arrangements for potential entrant countries are progressing? I am thinking particularly of the Baltic and of its proximity to the North sea. There is growing concern in ports in my area about possible problems, particularly given the more industrial capabilities of some Baltic fleets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's concern, but those states will have to negotiate the details of their accession, and fisheries will be part of the agenda. Existing EU member states will want to retain the present system, which is based on relative stability, and we do not see that being undermined by the accession of new member states. In that respect, there is a safeguard for the present distribution keys of quota within the EU, and we foresee no problem with the accession states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by adding my congratulations on your convenorship, Miss Begg. I am glad to be taking part in my first Standing Committee on a subject that is so important to my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
constituents, who live in one of the largest fishing constituencies in the north of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the North sea herring TAC and the agreements between the EU and Norway, the Minister will be aware that the Netherlands requested an adjustment to the tonnage allocated to the northern and southern areas of the northern sea. It was agreed to increase the southern area's allocation at the expense of the northern area, and the Scottish Pelagic Fishermens Association estimated that the net effect on the Scottish industry was a 5 per cent. decrease in its North sea herring share and that the southern area enjoyed a 140 per cent. year-on-year increase in its tonnage. I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have talked to the pelagic sector about that. There was a good scientific case for the split, but it does not alter our relative stability share. Even though there was a change in the split between the southern and northern North sea, the quota that was changed went to the UK pro rata. I should also tell the hon. Gentleman that the herring that was split in that way represents a tiny proportion of that available in the north North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also add my congratulations to you, Miss Begg, on becoming a Committee Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said in his statement that the Council rejected the Commission's proposal for a 25 per cent. cut in the nephrops quota, and I thank him for the part that he played in bring that about. However, we in the west of Scotland still have the 10 per cent. cut in the quota that was imposed the year before; not because nephrops were at risk, but because of the danger of cod by-catch. What scientific research is the Department doing to evaluate whether that cut has had a beneficial effect on cod and whether it is necessary to assist the cod recovery plan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments about the UK's role in the matter. As part of our case to the Commission, we did detailed research into the level of nephrops by-catch in the cod fishery and that of cod in the nephrops fishery. Our research demonstrated that the level of cod by-catch was very small and that the Commission's figures were an overestimate. That strong scientific case allowed us to pull the position back, because we could argue our case in relation to the principle and back it up with facts. Of course, we keep the situation under review, and we are examining the levels of uptake. We must take into account issues such as whitefish by-catch, and we are also interested in the development of separated trawls in the nephrops fishery. We must keep all those issues under consideration and review. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are alive to the issue and we will keep looking at the figures. We will, of course, always argue for an increase in TAC where there is a scientific case for doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, congratulate you most warmly, Miss Begg, on chairing the Committee. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
will be a great pleasure to take part in the proceedings and I am sure that we shall be ruled with a firm hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary mentioned that he favoured more effort control over deep sea stocks. I am sure that he is aware that those species have been targeted by British vessels in the last eight years, almost as a direct result of his suggestion that fishermen seek ways to compensate for their reduced earnings due to diminishing quotas in areas such as the North sea. Will he put up a strong case for those who have diversified into deep sea stocks? He will understand the unfair disadvantage that will be suffered by young British skippers, many of them from Scotland, who have shown initiative in both the production and marketing of the species but will, it seems, catch a cold. Will they be compensated in any way for the investments that they have made, and will he argue for that in the Council of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard that once or twice. It is always fascinating when the industry claims that it has targeted stocks thanks to a suggestion by me. I have never noticed the industry taking much notice of what I have to say in general, so it is surprising that they have adopted particular practices as a result of my advice. The reference period is key to the distribution of stocks. Certain member states will argue for a reference period that suits their track records. I assure the hon. Lady that we will not stand for that; we expect a reference period to be put in place that is fair and that reflects the development of the fishery by our own deep water fishery. So far as TAC is concerned, we will have to see what emerges from the Council of Ministers. However, I repeat that a TAC approach to deep water stocks would not necessarily be right. We are concerned that there might be discrete stocks of deep water species on the edge of the deep water continental shelf; stocks could be targeted on a quota, and the focus might move on until a great deal of damage had been done to each individual stock. We think that the effort control approach is the right one and I assure the hon. Lady that we shall argue for the our industry's track record to be taken into account in the same way as other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary give us his view on the list of designated ports and their status? Will it be possible for any changes to be made to the list on the basis of that designation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list was drawn up fairly and took into account a range of factors, such as whether sea fish inspectors were present, whether there was a market, the level of landings and the size of vessels. There will be a review of designated ports in due course and we shall take into account any further representations that we receive at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Under-Secretary a question about access to community waters, bearing in mind that I welcomed his reassurance on something that I had taken for granted; that protection of the six and 12-mile zones was always going to be without any serious question? I have seen a draft of the route map that raises further questions about access to areas outside those zones. I quote from the source that I have and would ask him to comment. It says,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to gradually extend free access to community waters beyond the 6-to-12-mile zones by rationalising existing access arrangements. For that purpose, it will necessary to identify, before the end of 2003, those access arrangements that correspond to genuine conservation needs and to remove those that do not".</p></blockquote>
This is the kind of question that I would expect the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) to ask, but will the Under-Secretary clarify the Commission's thinking and say whether he has any concerns about the approach and its possible impact on the British fishing industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we need to wait for the Commission's proposals before we can definitively comment on them. I can depend only on the statements of Commissioner Franz Fischler and on the Green Paper, which made it clear that the Commission recommended the retention of the six and 12-mile zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussions at the Council of Ministers, I have consistently argued that the six and 12-mile zone is an important conservation tool. Within that zone, there is exclusive control up to six miles and a certain control up to 12 miles, which means that we can apply unilateral non-discriminatory conservation measures to all vessels working in those zones. It also means that we can respond quickly in relation to conservation management and give special consideration to the needs of our inshore, under-10 m fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are perfectly justified reasons for the retention of those limits on conservation grounds alone. That is the majority view in the Council of Ministers, and I confidently expect them to be recommended in future proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to the issue of the herring TAC and the rearrangement in terms of the southern North sea, I was interested to note the Minister's remark that it affected only a tiny proportion of herring available in the north sea. If that TAC were so insignificant, would he not consider using the formal mechanism to allow United Kingdom fisheries departments directly to intervene and apply a margin of correction to the United Kingdom internal allocations? Will he confirm, too, that the scientific evidence to which he referred is in the public realm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a change in the relative quotas, which caused an increase in the southern North sea, as the hon. Gentleman says. The overall quota for herring and other pelagic species is a tiny part of that, which we should bear in mind. It is also worth noting that there has been no readjustment in previous years when those fishing in the southern North sea suffered a disproportionate reduction in their quota share. There was an argument about the distribution of the quota, which we acknowledged, as was only fair and reasonable, but there was no loss to the United Kingdom allocation in the distribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Reid</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Based on the scientific evidence available, does the Under-Secretary share the Commission's view that the 10 per cent. cut in the nephrops quota in the west of Scotland is still justified? Is it necessary for that cut to be imposed on all sectors of the nephrops fishery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always argued in the Council that the 10 per cent. cut was unjustified, but we should bear in mind that the nephrop quota has been increased and is now quite good. We should also consider the uptake figures before we start making a great case about the 10 per cent. cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will come as no surprise to the Under-Secretary that many of us have seen a copy of the Commission's draft proposals. In fact, he has one in front of him. If my memory serves me right, there was no mention of the six-mile limit. Will he tell us what the Government position will be if that was omitted from the final document, as it would have serious implications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have implications, but we would need to clarify what the Commission meant by that. I, too, have seen the leaked proposals, but I do not know whether they will be the final ones. According to the proposals, the Commission is proposing an enormous autonomy for member states for up to 12 miles. That might well mean that the autonomy is increased to up to 12 miles instead of up to six miles, but I may be interpreting that wrongly; we will have to resolve those issues in the Council. We shall certainly argue to retain autonomy for up to six miles, but I would be keen to pursue an increased autonomy of up to 12 miles, if that is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would address the issue of access beyond the 12-mile zone. I would like to know whether the issue of relative stability, which will be carried forward into the common fisheries policy, will be in any way undermined by the Commission's proposals to extend access beyond the 12-mile zone, as stated in the leaked draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From discussions that the Under-Secretary has had, can he clarify the Commission's intention on proposals to establish multi-annual quotas? I understand that member states will be able to discuss the proposals for the first year, but thereafter the Commission will more or less manage multi-annual quotas as it has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we will have to see how the details are explained when we consider the Commission's final proposals. There is no sign either in the Commission proposals or in the attitude of other member states that the principle of relative stability will be undermined. I do not doubt that one or two countries will want to explore the possibility of increasing their share of the quota and altering the stability keys. However, if there is any suggestion that we will explore the opening-up of the stability keys, we will have our say, too, along with every other country. I do not believe that it is in anyone's interests to reconsider relative stability. The idea that someone would gain from doing so is mistaken, and all countries recognise that. Anyway, I do not think that that is the mood, or that the Commission will propose doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a strong advocate of multi-annual quotas, which I think are the way forward. The only concern is whether stocks are able to take multi-annual management, but we will have to explore that issue using expert scientific advice. We are applying multi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
annual quotas to several stocks. The detail about the Commission's proposals for its own role will have to be explored in discussion with the Council of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to see another Scot in a position of power in this House, Miss Begg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question is about food hygiene regulations, which are an important part of the process. Where are we on that issue in terms of legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain which aspects of food hygiene regulations my hon. Friend refers to. Food hygiene regulations have changed over many years. They have had implications for fish markets and, to a certain extent, onboard handling, and, as far as fish markets are concerned, it is right that the regulations should have changed. I recently visited several fish markets. I was at the opening of Fishgate, the brand new fish market in Hull, which is a superb facility with temperature control and automatic grading. I have also had the opportunity to discuss the new Peterhead market when I was at Fishing 2002. Those markets are being designed to deal with the latest hygiene regulations and to ensure that fish is handled in conditions of the highest possible quality. Fish is a quality product and fishermen can obtain a quality price, but it must be handled properly. Attention must be given to ensuring quality control from catcher to consumer, and I am pleased to see the investment that has taken place in our ports for that type of hygiene control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many British vessels, as has already been said, have moved to the deep water fishery because of difficulties with the demersal sector on the continental shelf. Perhaps the increase in fish farming is for the same reason. Has the Under-Secretary any indication of the tonnage of feed used by United Kingdom fish farms and where that feed is sourced from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we have that information. I do not have the figures to hand, but I will be happy to let the hon. Lady have them. It is inevitable that, as the aquaculture sector has increased, fish food production and consumption have also increased. The aquaculture sector has been successful in the United Kingdom. It is an important source of employment in remote rural areas. We should acknowledge that much of the material for fish meal comes from the industrial fishery. As she will know, for many years I have advocated changes in the North sea industrial fishery. My views have not changed on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will be aware that the Commission has been developing proposals for a European Union-based, centralised inspection and enforcement proposal. What is his response to that, bearing in mind the general concern, in the fishing industry and across all parties in the UK, that we should not further centralise the common fisheries policy? Rather, we should seek every opportunity to establish effective or even mandatory bilateral
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
arrangements between fishing countries to enable them to inspect each other and report back to the Commission on any misdemeanours that are identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point. All indications that I have received from the Commission suggest that that is also its thinking. The Commission is not in a position to put in place an EU enforcement programme. It does not have the facilities or resources. In fact, I do not think that it particularly wants to do such a thing. Quite properly, enforcement is a member state responsibility and I think that it will remain so. I do not see the Commission recommending change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a role for the Commission, precisely along the lines outlined by the hon. Gentleman; to ensure consistency of enforcement. It should ensure that each member state meets its obligations in relation to enforcement. That is not a new role, because the Commission already has that responsibility. It oversees enforcement and draws up an annual report on member state enforcement. It can look around ports and companies, with the cooperation of individual member states, to see what they are doing. That is right and proper. The UK has nothing to fear, and there is a role for the Commission in ensuring consistency of enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People will be reassured to learn that the Commission's proposals are now due out at the end of May, with 28 May being the date bandied around. There have been rumours, including one on the web today, that the Commission has delayed publication because of the sensitive political situation in France. I do not know what credence we should give that. Alex Smith, president of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said at a meeting earlier today that he believed that the proposals had been put on hold indefinitely. I do not believe that that is true, as the Under-Secretary outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are more delays, there will obviously be tremendous pressure towards the end of the year. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that if no new management system is agreed by 1 January 2003, there will be equal access to a common resource, as in 1983 in the so-called Kent Kirk case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interpretation is that if there is no agreement in 2002, the present CFP mechanism will be automatically rolled over. The only thing that will not be rolled over is the six and 12-mile limits. I am pleased that a discreet nod from my advisers confirms that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, there would be no change to the so-called principle of access to a common resource, as it is governed by relative stability. The only thing that would change would be that if the six and 12-mile limits were not renewed, theoretically, people who have no historical right of access between six and 12 miles could fish in those zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those were the circumstances in the case of the famous Captain Kirk, who set off in his fishing boat to boldly go where no one had gone before; he went to fish within the coast limits, as there was a gap on renewal at the time. I do not expect that to happen. As
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I said, I believe that there is a consensus among member states for coastal limits to be renewed and, indeed, our intention is for them to be renewed permanently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary comment on proposals that I understand to be in the Commission's forthcoming document on strengthening technical measures to conserve stock and avoid unnecessary by-catch and discard? As he will know, the fishing industry in this country has been arguing for such measures for a long time. I understand that the Commission is considering proposals for improvements, including the use of more selective gear, larger mesh size, square mesh panels and separator grids, changes in design and rigging, greater use of closed areas, mini quotas for by-catches and discard ban trials. What involvement has this country had in the discussion and development of those proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been closely involved in arguing, for example, for more selective gear and square mesh panels, which have been pioneered by the UK fishing industry. Square mesh panels are now mandatory throughout the EU nephrops fishery in the North sea, because of UK influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have seen the proposals. As I said, it is premature to discuss them now, as we do not know the final shape of the proposals that the Commission will present to the Council, but I believe, judging from some of the documents, that there is a great deal of common sense in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good argument in favour of mini quotas for by-catch and other proposals designed to minimise by-catch problems, which is desirable. The proposals show that the Commission is thinking along the right lines and that what we and the UK fishing industry have been saying—for some time, I concede—has not gone unnoticed. One sometimes feels that what one says is ignored and that nothing ever happens. This shows that the arguments that we have advanced, backed up with science and practical experience, have influenced the Commission's thinking, which is all for the good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary oppose any suggestion of internationally traded quotas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall oppose internationally traded quotas, as we do not think that they are in the interests of our industry or of a lot of industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues surrounding the management of quotas include how one can manage one's quota in relation to other countries that have a surplus when one's own industry is under real pressure. That happens with channel cod, for example. We currently deal with those situations with such things as international swaps, which is right and proper. We do not want to lose that facility and can explore ways of making it work a little better. However, I do not think that the industry is ready for the selling of quotas across international boundaries and I do not think that that would be in our national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the management of quota from the perspective of reducing fleet size, I know that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
industry welcomed this year's decommissioning scheme. However, there have been anecdotal reports that some skippers who have received a decommissioning grant have seen that as money that they can put towards investment in new vessels. That clearly undermines the purpose. I understand that it is not impossible for that to happen. Can the Under-Secretary rehearse some of the efforts that the UK Government have made to try to ensure that the money for decommissioning cannot simply be reinvested to add further capacity to the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the decommissioning money cannot be used for reinvestment to increase capacity. That is impossible because there are caps on capacity and restrictions on the number of licences available. However, if a fisherman decommissions a fishing boat and then has a capital gain, we cannot prevent him from reinvesting that in the fishing industry in some way. We cannot control that. There are potential benefits to be gained from such investment in the industry, but we must be careful that it does not then distort different segments of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a tendency for some time—it is not a new tendency—for some people to sell off their larger boats and invest in boats under 10 m. If new, under-10 m boats, which are specially designed and very efficient, are commissioned, issues are raised not of increased capacity, but of increased effort. We are aware of that. Those are not extra vessels, but people have to have licences for them, so they buy up licences from existing under-10 m boats. There is a potential problem because a licence might be bought from a very inactive or inefficient under-10 m boat for a new, very efficient under-10 m vessel. We are alert to that, and have put a limit on horsepower for those new vessels to try to restrict the amount of effort. However, as long as the investment is within the capped effort control, and as long as it is not increasing capacity, in many ways it is not a bad thing for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Winterton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Congleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We always find ourselves in an unusual situation when the Committee is asked to take note of a regulation that a Minister and his counterparts in the Council agreed some four
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
months ago in Brussels. However, that is how the cookie crumbles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eyes of the whole industry are now firmly set on the future, not on the recent past. I cannot, in all honesty, congratulate the Minister on another deal that does not tackle the deep-seated problems facing the industry but that will, I believe, cause fishermen even greater hardship. I trust that he will take on board the concerns of Members contributing this afternoon when he attends the next Fisheries Council, which I understand is scheduled for 11 June, including in particular the two proposals on deep sea stocks on which we have already touched. It is clear that the presidency wishes to achieve a positive result on fisheries before the ends of its term on 30 June. The Under-Secretary has recently advised fishermen that they should look to other areas to compensate for the continuing loss of opportunities within Community waters and has suggested that fishermen should try to add value and find new opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will be aware that approximately 30 vessels, mainly from Scotland, have made financial investments of about £80 million to diversify into the catching of deep water species. I understand that Greenland halibut and redfish are not to be regulated, which will certainly provide a loophole that will be of enormous benefit to the French, allowing them to continue to fish uncontrolled. Will the Under-Secretary investigate this situation during his negotiations in Council? It would surely be prudent to obtain definitive scientific evidence regarding these species before any closed areas are put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will take on board the message that the true deep water species fishery is worth approximately £13 million a year to Scottish vessels. That valuable resource cannot be allowed to be lost to those particular local economies through the allocation of insufficient quota or days at sea. Special fishing permits created within the provisions of the treaty of Corfu, to which we are legally bound, will once again be the management tool. We must also remember that, should he fail to obtain the sufficient quota or time allowed, a double-edged sword will fall on the Scottish deep sea sector because those vessels will have no alternative option but to target the already hard-pressed stocks in areas such as the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, with the imminent threat of regulation from the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, we are seeing a build-up of effort to secure track record. The Under-Secretary, in reply to one of the questions, did touch on our position on that. If the EU introduces unilateral measures, we would probably see the development of Olympic-style fisheries, as third countries race to secure track records before the NEAFC regulations are introduced. It is true to say that the industry faces a very difficult situation where the moral high ground does not in fact pay the mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was something of a surprise that the Under-Secretary suggested, during last Thursday's Department of Environment, Food and Rural
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Affairs Question Time, that repatriation of fishing policy to member states meant drawing a line down the North sea. I think that he was teasing the House by speaking with his tongue firmly in his cheek because he will remember only too well that the line was drawn by a previous Labour Government in 1976, which established the British 200 mile to median line zone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is indisputable that fish know no boundaries and when the food chain is broken, as is happening with a vengeance at present in EU water due to the complete failure of the rigid management system in place, they will move to other areas. I was delighted to hear the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) make a light-hearted comment last week about the nationality of fish and, at the same time, show genuine concern that the proposed regional advisory councils will be mere talking shops. He and his party have set great store by the concept of regional management, and it must be most galling to find that what is to be implemented is a hollow sham without real teeth and without a real say in how policy is delivered in the fishing regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amsterdam treaty does, of course, expressly forbid any power being devolved from the centre, so the thought of anything other than what is on offer was always wishful thinking. Moreover, the proposal that members serving on these councils will represent all stakeholders will ensure that they must reflect wide-ranging and indeed diverse opinions. I think that the industry is fearful that if the measures come into effect they will be unwieldy and its influence—because that is all that it can be—will diminish as a result. It would be difficult to imagine, for example, the aquaculture lobby agreeing to curtailment of industrial fishing when it needs food to feed fish in their farms. The Under-Secretary has said that that sector has grown considerably over the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, in his comments and answers, never fails to mention the fact that it was a former Conservative Government who signed the treaty of accession. He obviously places great store in the treaties, and I agree that he is right to do so because they dictate the limits of our powers to act on behalf of our own industry. He tells us that the most important factors in the forthcoming changes are access to quota and the maintenance of the present share-out under relative stability. The treaties, however, make no mention of this share. He really cannot have it both ways. It is a sad disappointment that he is going into negotiations believing transitional discriminatory derogations will override treaties based on equality and non-discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's 1991 report clearly stressed the importance of distinguishing between the principle of relative stability and the shares approved and applied in the 20-year period under that principle since 1983— in other words, the application keys. From 1 January 2003, the application keys will have to be decided on a non-discriminatory basis. That decision will be made by the Council and must ensure relative stability of fishing activities using their individual size at the end of the meti-annual guidance 4 programme of all the fishing fleets of member states. The economic importance of the whole of the industry, including the processing sector, in fishing regions throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Community, will most likely be a factor. In addition to the allocation of quota shares for each member state, fishing effort may also be allocated amongst the member states, probably calculated as kilowatt-days. These will be the subject of negotiations, among other matters, in the Council of Ministers later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will not mind me pointing out a lesson that we should learn from the past. The 1983 allocations were decided under the principle of relative stability, and permitted the UK additional opportunities to compensate them partially for the loss of the deep water fishing opportunities resulting from the exclusion of British vessels from Icelandic waters. During the past year, as a result of the exclusion of vessels from the waters around Morocco and Senegal, many fishing opportunities have been lost by Spain. Large deep water vessels are currently lying idle in Spanish ports. The Community cannot subsidise these vessels indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two points that the Under-Secretary might like to take on board are, first, that Spain may seek additional quotas and days under the deep water proposals being discussed at present as compensation for the loss of those third-country agreements, and, secondly, that as a result of the UK setting the precedent in 1983, Spain may seek to secure an extra share of quota and days in compensation for the loss of those third country opportunities when the new relative stability keys are negotiated. Of course if a new management structure is not in place by 31 December of this year, article 2 of Council regulation 101/76 prevails with the possibility of a repetition of the famous Kent Kirk situation, which the Under-Secretary put clearly on the record in response to an earlier question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good us now blaming a previous Conservative Government. Indeed, I—the Under-Secretary will be relieved to hear this—do not blame the previous Labour Government which created and then gave away the 12 to 200-mile zone. The buck stops with Parliament. It is Parliament that determines that competence over all British waters from the base line to 200 miles remains in the hands of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament could choose the opposite; national control. The Under-Secretary has asked many times what I mean by that. When he was a shadow Minister with responsibility for fisheries he taught us well. He might recall that he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the CFP should be radically reformed to allow us far greater autonomy and national control of fishing waters within our country's limits."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must say that the current situation is unacceptable and that there is a better way which meets the criteria of the CFP, but which gives all member states greater national control and a better way of managing fish stocks leading to a sustainable fishing industry. If we do not meet that objective we will have no fishing industry"</p></blockquote>
The final quote is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The common resource is a key issue in the common fisheries policy. The Labour Party does not think that the use of expression 'common resource' is a credible position to take within the common fisheries policy".—	<i>[Official Report, European Standing Committee A,</i> 23 July 1996; c. 25–27.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Well done on that tremendous u-turn. On taking power and entering government, the Under-Secretary hid the pretentious claim that a transitional derogation overrides a treaty obligation. None of that, of course, was mentioned when the above words were uttered, but I believe that what I have said is absolutely correct. Unless that matter is cleared up, it does not auger well for the coming months of negotiations.

I have not before been to a Committee that has been chaired by you and I am very pleased to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have any expertise in this area, although I have a long-standing interest. If hon. Members look back at previous Parliaments, they will find that when I was a member of this Standing Committee I made the then Conservative Government aware of the fact that they had signed up to treaties that were costing us greatly. I recognised that the price of Mrs. Thatcher's famous rebate was that she sold out the Irish box to the European Union, thereby destroying the livelihoods of a large number of fishermen in Scotland and elsewhere. That deal had not been flagged up at all by the Government of the day, who had assured us that they would defend the Irish box to the end. It seems that they meant to the end of the meeting, not to the end of their term in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman welcome the fact that I have tried to flag up what might happen to the Scottish deep sea fleet if some of the proposals that we believe might be introduced come into place? Will he work with the Opposition to ensure the best deal for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognised some oblique references that might have been relevant to Scotland, but with the Under-Secretary in the Committee, I have no need to look to the Opposition for support. I think that this particular Minister has been one of the most determined advocates of all of the agricultural and fishing interests that he, with his portfolios, has had to represent. That is why it is such a pleasure to be back here supporting the Government's motion today, although I cannot vote on it because I am not a Committee member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to bring to the Committee some of the briefings that I have received from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, with which I have had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
sporadic but always positive contact since the days when we were fighting the Conservative Government's proposal to sell out the Irish box so that Mrs. Thatcher would get the rebate. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, and we would have preferred to debate total allowable catches before the agreement was finalised in December 2001 but we had no chance to do so. I thank the Minister for supplying the Committee with supplementary information to update that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation brings together the seven fishermen's associations in Scotland with one voice, which I hope is a counsel on behalf of the industry and for good common sense in European fisheries. It has no fundamental difference with the Government's assessment of the state of stocks; it is important that it starts from the same point, even though it may have different suggestions. It says that the problem with some allocations is that although they are meant to relate to national catches, they actually relate to national landings. The federation foresees a problem: although it would appear that the allocation of quotas prevents people from entering British waters to fish, climate change and the warming of the sea have meant a huge increase in sea bass and red mullet stock, which people can fish—those are not part of the allowable catches for the main species. The problem is ensuring that people fish for only non-quota fish, which becomes a question of policing. That concern is expressed in the briefings, which will be discussed in detail with the fisheries protection authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation welcomes the fact that restrictions on fishing in the Shetland box have been retained, which it values as highly as it valued the Irish box before that was put out to common access by all other European fisheries. It also welcomes the allocations being made according to the relative stability principles and their effect on coastal communities. It expresses concern that in preliminary discussions there has been talk of those being breached to allow a free-market approach to the distribution of fishing rights. The federation would strongly urge a defence of those principles by the Government should they come under serious discussion. At the moment, they are just ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation speaks at length about the risk of collateral damage. It stresses that the factor of total allowable catches, not total allowable landings, is a great problem. We should change the debate so that people do not just think in terms of catches. For example, because of the quotas, total effort is transferred to what is called high grading—landing only the most valuable fish—which leads to an increase in the discarding of fish because only landings count. Fishermen do not like to do that, but they are aware that it is common practice, and it concerns them. People can increase the value of their available quota by landing only the most valuable fish. That is wrong, and the federation says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will lead to excessive discarding and will increase mortality beyond the levels foreseen by the TAC".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
That is difficult for fishermen to cope with, because they do not like to see saleable fish discarded, yet the system pushes them in that direction. The federation says that that is regrettable, with which I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation is concerned about how we approach total allowable catches and capacity. It quotes some figures: from 1998 to 2001, catches of cod were down from 33,497 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes; haddock was down from 65,167 tonnes to 41,000 tonnes; whiting was down from 76,444 tonnes to 10,000 tonnes. In the same period, tonnage per vessel went down considerably. In 1998, there were 585 vessels, and in 2001 there were 510. The number of vessels has not gone down in proportion to the decrease in allowable catches. Tonnage per vessel was 211 tonnes per vessel in 1998, 188 tonnes per vessel in 1999, 152 tonnes per vessel in 2000 and 139 tonnes per vessel in 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"fleet capacity is seriously out of balance with the fishing opportunities available in the current year. Average landings per vessel show a decline of almost 34 per cent. since 1998 and, as a result, fishing entitlement is spread ever more thinly."</p></blockquote>
It discusses a number of ways in which to deal with that. Something must be done when there is a system of allowable catches and an industry with so many vessels on the water. It discusses the question of decommissioning and the option of a lay-up scheme. I will not go into detail, but I hope that the Minister will sit down with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and discuss its figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation also talks about the possibility of a supplementary effort limitation with a 20 per cent. decommissioning target, which it says would
	<br><blockquote><p>"retain enough capacity in the fleet to operate recovered stocks at or near maximum sustainable yield".</p></blockquote>
We have to look at the situation and plan positively with the industry, which is committed, and with Members of Parliament, many of whom represent industries from within the Scottish parliamentary contingent, who represent those coastal areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The federation states that a laying-up scheme covering 180 fishing days at an average of £1,000 per day would cost £7.2 million in its first year. As stocks regenerate, however, that figure would come down to perhaps £1 million in the fifth year. Overall, it would cost £20 million over five years to do what the federation has been urging us to do. It took to the high seas to sail down the east coast and up the river Forth when the Scottish Parliament was discussing the matter, despite it not being in the Scottish Parliament's gift to take such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The frustration felt by Scottish fishermen is real. The scheme is not a get-rich-quick scheme for the fisheries or fishing communities. It is a genuine attempt to make total allowable catches sustainable and to permit them to grow in the long term. I hope that today's resolution will be passed and that the Committee takes into account the serious concerns and positive and constructive suggestions from both the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and other federations around the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have an opportunity to add a few words to this important debate, which comes at an important time. As the Minister pointed out in his opening remarks, the debate could have been timed to coincide with the publication of the route map for the common fisheries policy, which I know we want to debate intensely and heavily later this year. That was an opportunity, and it is an enormous disappointment to us all that that publication has been delayed for reasons about which some will speculate. A lot of us know, however, what is going on behind the scenes, and my well-informed sources suggest that the UK Government have not caused the delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Congleton suggested that I was making light of the Conservative's proposal. As far as I am aware, the Conservatives do not have a policy on fishing. Nevertheless, the proposal comes from a Back Bencher, although I presume it is supported by Front-Bench Members, and, as far as it is clear, concerns the repatriation of British fishing policy. That is fine in theory, but I should like to see some workable proposals on paper. It was perhaps appropriate that I made light of the proposal during Thursday's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions because no serious proposals are coming from the Conservatives, and I am left with no other option than to make light of it. We should be concerned about the future of the common fisheries policy, and it is right that we should robustly criticise its absolute failure. The hon. Lady should be well aware that Liberal Democrats have for years strongly and robustly criticised its failures. Indeed, Members of Parliament of all parties have identified its very clear failings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which to move forward is to come up with robust alternatives to the common fisheries policy, and to engage robustly in the debate that is presently going on in Europe. The Conservatives are putting their heads in the sand if they believe that they can jump out of the reality before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not recall the question that he asked last week. He did not refer to the Conservative's policy of national control, which will be spelled out at an appropriate time. He and his party have pushed for regional management being a large part of the answer to the absolute environmental, economic and social disaster that is the common fisheries policy. Its rigid system of management means that fish stocks will never recover and regenerate until it is drastically altered or got rid of. His party's proposal cannot be introduced. He must be disappointed that the regional advisory councils are talking shops because of the terms of the Amsterdam treaty, which expressly forbids the return of the powers that his party seeks. He is stymied before he starts. Perhaps he can tell us how he proposes to bring his policy about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving me an opportunity to clarify the matter. It is clear that if we are going to engage with the debate regarding the future development of the common fisheries policy it is appropriate that I should make
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
light of the nonsense that is the Conservatives as yet unworked-out policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to develop regionalisation of the common fisheries policy, which is a policy for which Liberal Democrats have argued longer than any other party, we have to engage robustly in the debate. I am disappointed by the drafts that I have seen and the indications that I have had that the regional advisory councils would not have all the powers that I would seek for them. Indeed, the Minister indicated in his response last week that he would be disappointed if they were to end up simply as talking shops. The hon. Lady has to accept that the only way in which we can seek an improvement to the common fisheries policy is by engaging in that debate rather than believing that we can step aside and not take part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafts that I have seen clearly indicate that the regional advisory councils will be given certain consultation rights, particularly in relation to the drawing up of plans, the monitoring of those plans and other powers. It is only by engaging in the debate that we can argue with other nation states and seek a solution that gives the regional advisory councils the kind of powers that the Minister and I believe that they should have. I assume that the hon. Lady would also like them to have those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all his friends would like the regional advisory councils to have those powers, but the Commission will not actually need to take any notice of any plans, reports or recommendations from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Miss Begg. I have come to hear a discussion about the Government's position on a European document sent to the Committee, and I appear to be listening to a squabble between two other political parties about a policy that is not relevant to the document sent to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the Member who has given way whether he accepts the intervention or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) is right to draw attention to the fact that the debate must relate to the management of total allowable catches. I want be sure that that does happen, but the fact is that the framework in which total allowable catches are managed—this is fundamental to the consideration of the documents before the Committee—is the common fisheries policy itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the functions of the proposed regional councils, each fishery in the region where the councils operate must prepare and submit to the Commission fishery management plans, on their own initiative or at the request of the Commission. To give an opinion on the Commission—or on member states' proposals on conservation and management dealing with the fishery relevant to the region concerned—it must monitor the implementation of Community legislation and conduct any other activities as required. If that is what is proposed in the route map document published by the European Commission, regional bodies will not have the sort of powers that I and many other people who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
concerned about the future of the fishing industry believe that they should be given to engage properly in the effective management of stock for the sustainable maintenance of the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Congleton has sought to score petty political points when we should be robustly engaged in debate in the real world, not fighting past battles. All those battles do is identify where the Conservatives have failed the country in the past. We have yet to see what the Conservatives say—we have been waiting many years—about how their policy can be brought forward, after 18 years when they failed to implement any of the hyperbole that we have heard in recent years. The fact is that we need to consider serious alternatives. If they exist, they deserve proper scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue for debate today is the future management of total allowable catches. As the Under-Secretary said in his opening remarks, those must be based on science, where it is available. For many stocks, accurate scientific assessment is not properly available. In those circumstances, I would be grateful if he clarified where he believes the Commission and scientists should be going in advising Ministers and nation states about the use of the precautionary principle where the scientific advice is still rather ill-founded, and the margins in which the assessments are made are still rather wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposals coming forward for multi-annual quotas, as the Under-Secretary does, and I think that they need further debate. He is right in seeking to ensure how those plans can be brought forward in detail. I am reassured by his response to my earlier question about joint inspection and enforcement. If, as far as possible, that can be established by making full use of nation state resources and assuring the nation state's fishermen that they are being monitored and inspected by their own state's inspectorate, that would be reassuring. Of course, we do need to establish bilateral arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's document—and a lot of debate—indicated greater and extensive use of satellite monitoring. I understand that vessel monitoring by satellite might be proposed under the common fisheries policy for vessels up to 10 m by 1 January 2004, which would be welcome, and that electronic logbooks may be introduced in pilot areas by 1 January 2003. If that is the case, we are only months away from implementation of the proposals. I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary indicated what efforts his Department has made to ensure that, if UK vessels are to be engaged in the pilot schemes, they will be capable of doing so. The initiative is very exciting and represents the way forward for the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the greater use of technical measures, rather than simply quotas and tax to manage stock, proposals that made better use of the developing science and of technical measures would be most welcome. I was reassured by the Under-Secretary's response that efforts are being made but, clearly, a great deal more still needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
One of the most contentious issues in the debate over the future of the common fisheries policy is the use of public subsidy for modernisation and increased capacity. The Under-Secretary is right to take the position that he has taken on grants for modernisation and capacity and effort increase. However, I want to ensure that he keeps the door open to the possibility of grants for improving crew comfort and fishing safety, particularly in fishing regions where the economy is in a failing or threatened state and where regional aid might be made available. I would welcome some reassurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the management of stock, I understand that the Commission is seriously considering proposals suggested earlier for the funded tie-up of certain vessels. I know that that caused great contention in the Scottish Executive, and I am well aware of the Under-Secretary's view on it. However, if there were an opportunity to examine how the rather unplanned scheme in Scotland operated and to reflect on whether, under short or long-term measures, stock recovery might be enabled through tie-ups, it might be possible to improve the state of stocks in British and wider European waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been noted, the hon. Member for Congleton and I had a debate earlier about the role of regional advisory councils. Without expanding that further, my clear view is that those councils or committees should be given real teeth. Simply giving them a role to monitor and draw up plans that then have to be rubber-stamped by the European Commission only ensures that they do not do their job as seriously or as effectively as I believe that they should. If they are given real powers, we will see real improvements, particularly in the nitty-gritty in terms of the way in which stock is managed in those regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to explain how he proposes that such powers should be given to regional advisory councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the proposals at present, the councils should establish management plans and give opinions to the Commission. It is essential that the Commission take a lighter-touch control on the role of those councils. Clearly, there must be much more debate and agreement at European level on the matter but, when the opportunities are properly understood by nation states, I am sure that we shall see improvements in the powers available to the councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way to achieve such improvement is by engaging in debate, not simply crying wolf and saying that it will never happen. The fact is that we were told that it would never happen and that we would retain our six-mile and 12-mile limits. We were told that that would never happen by the same flat earth society that said that relative stability tenets would not be conveyed beyond 2002. We must recognise that, despite the scaremongering, such aspects of policy should be carried forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the end of my comments. I should be very happy to discuss the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
matter more fully when we debate the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to detain the Committee for so long, but I have two further points to put to the Under-Secretary. The first is on the management of deep sea stocks. We have touched on that, and he knows well that, especially in international waters beyond the continental shelf, many of those stocks have long lives, but many of them do not reach sexual maturity for many years, although I cannot recall all of the species now. To be plundering those stocks at this stage without a proper scientific assessment of their state raises serious questions about the future of international fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the document deals with that, and some of the stocks in international waters are given quotas, it is important that they are properly monitored. We do not have opportunities for full debates on the way in which those stocks are managed, but we know that at present both UK vessels and, more especially, those from other countries, are targeting those species and plundering those stocks. We do not know very clearly what impact that is having.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on total allowable catches, we have debated bass and the cetacean by-catch related to that, especially in the pair trawling industry. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary and his Department have come up with what I believe is robust research, which clearly identifies the pair trawling industry as one part of the industry that is causing concern, in particular over the by-catch of dolphins. I should tell him that I have a meeting with the French ambassador tomorrow morning and shall be taking representatives of my local industry to discuss with him what impact he believes the French pair trawling industry has on dolphins in the English channel. I know that the Under-Secretary has engaged in dialogue with the French authorities and has written to Franz Fischler on the issue, so I should be grateful if he would comment on progress in that regard when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have raised several important points, which is the advantage of an opportunity for scrutiny of this kind. I appreciate the opportunity that the Committee gives Members to question Government policy and to give their views on the development of negotiation and policy in the EU as they unfold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with Greenland halibut and redfish. Generally speaking, those species are part of agreements that we have, with Iceland on redfish and with Greenland on Greenland halibut, which is a third country agreement with the EU. Those species are quota-controlled; we do not have a free-for-all fishery, and our distant water fleet find that that is important. There are opportunities on the Icelandic fishery through a ballot, which has become established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European fisheries permits have not appeared, and they do not seem to feature in the Commission's proposals. The idea that we will all be operating under an EU permit by 2003 is not borne out by reality, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
it is an example of some of the wilder claims that have been made during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deep water stocks and Olympic fisheries are important issues. The risk of Olympic fisheries remains, which is well understood by the Commission and the Council. Whatever the discussions about deep water stocks, and about whether there will be TACs or effort control, there is a cut-off, which would certainly have applied since last year. I assure the hon. Member for Congleton that people who have piled into fisheries over the past year will not necessarily have their landings taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before hon. Members write off regional advisory committees, let us see the proposal and give them a chance. The committees' framework and the Commission's proposals are right. Involvement in the committees and how they will operate are issues that are up for negotiation. The industry will be very much be engaged with that process and we will take notice of their views. I say to the hon. Member for Congleton that it is not unreasonable to take other stakeholders' views on fisheries management into account. One stakeholder is the recreational sector; sea anglers, for example. Many commercial fishermen earn part of their living by taking sea anglers out to sea, so they have a legitimate voice on the matter. I know that the sea anglers were pleased that the UK Government took their views into account in our submission to the Green Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Under-Secretary's comments about people having a voice, but he did use the word "voice." Does he accept that the document— I am sure that he has seen it although he earlier indicated that he might not have done—specifically states that the Commission is not bound by recommendation reports? Will he also comment on the Amsterdam treaty, which forbids power from being devolved from the centre? That seems quite a hurdle to overcome. How does the Under-Secretary or the Commission propose to change the Amsterdam treaty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not have to change the Amsterdam treaty because the documents relate to the way in which the committees will operate. I can only speculate because discussions have yet to be held and we do not yet know the Commission's view, but let us take the example of a regional advisory committee. It is allowed to make recommendations and to have views on quota and conservation management within zones of interest, which the UK Government will encourage. However, recommendations may have to return to full Council for ratification. That model is not unique, but it is well understood, gives people a great deal of freedom and autonomy and can be further developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of regional management is a new concept that has been greatly pushed by the UK and UK industry. I am glad to say that our industry has been engaging with industry groups from other countries to explain what we mean by it. We are not talking about back-door nationalism through regional advisory committees, but about a more logical and evolved management system for the CFP. It is a question of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
confidence-building, and of implementing a framework. Once the framework is in place, it can be developed, which should be a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me press the Minister on that. Will the committees have power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would hope so, but that is an issue to be developed. I gave the hon. Lady a clear example of how they can work and have power, but in the framework of the Council of Ministers. It can be done. In reality, it is an evolving process, and we must accept that to a certain extent. The important thing is to get the framework in place and the principle established. That is what we will be arguing for, and I am confident that we will make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary be prepared to comment on the argument of the same doom merchants that we will not retain national control of our six and 12-mile limits, that we will not retain relative stability and that there will be no regional management committees in any form whatever, let alone as talking shops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misquote people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Congleton had a few comments about what the hon. Gentleman said.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out to the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for St. Ives that I have not made any such claims. I know that the 12-mile limit will be made permanent. That is obvious; it is in the paper. However, the six-mile limit is not. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relative stability has become an accepted part of the CFP. The Commission accepts it, the Commission's legal services accept it and the Council of Ministers accepts it. We can argue about the exact wording of the treaty, but in the end what matters is the decision of the Council of Ministers. It is clear to me that the principle of relative stability is well established in the Council of Ministers.

On the point about the deep water fleet vessels displaced from Morocco, I have actually been to one of the worst-affected fishing ports in Spain, which has lost access due to the closure of Moroccan waters. I assure the hon. Lady that those are not deep water vessels, in the main. They are not vessels that can prosecute other fisheries, apart from the coastal waters, in relation to Morocco where they were
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
operating. There may be the odd large vessel involved in that fishery, but they can re-deploy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the United Kingdom, when we lost access to Iceland, Spain has a very generous share of the third-country fishing agreements from the EU. One of the points that the Spanish Minister made in relation to the renegotiation of some of those agreements was to reflect the loss to the Spanish industry of Morocco. That is where the Spanish have been concentrating, not arguing for redistribution of EU quota. Its fishing fleet could not make use of it in any case, due to that fleet's nature. I think that I can reassure the hon. Lady on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the comments that the hon. Lady quoted back to me, I am glad to say that my position has not changed by one iota. It is certainly true that my language might be more diplomatic since I have become a Minister, in relation to what I can and cannot say. Let me look through what I said in 1996.I said that the CFP needed to change, that we needed more autonomy in member states and that there needed to be more national control and management in our coastal limits within the criteria of the CFP. That was what I argued for in 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that there should be much greater devolution and flexibility within the framework of the common fisheries policy. I have not changed my views. Indeed, I am glad to say that the case that I argued in 1996 is reflected in the Commission's proposal in 2002. It is nice to have been involved in a debate, seen some changes and witnessed the emergence of a consensus with member states that share similar views. I believe in flexibility and management within the framework of a common fisheries policy and I see no contradiction in that. There is no difference between what I am saying now and what I said then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views on common resource have not changed either. In 1996, I said that the concept of common resource was not credible because, although it was established in the treaty and is an important concept to other member states, in reality it has been overshadowed by relative stability. In that respect, it is misleading when common resource is thrown around as a doom and gloom prediction by the flat earth society, referred to by the hon. Member for St. Ives. We have moved on from that position. I made the point in 1996, and it is entirely relevant today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East. I can confirm that the Scottish Fisheries Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations have been constructive in their comments about the changes. I also understand his point about stocks that are not currently quota controlled, such as red mullet. There is a growing red mullet fishery in the North sea, which is all to the good, and I am pleased to see our fisherman taking advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may wish to discuss with the Commission whether small, unallocated quotas should be wrapped up within the North sea quota. However, it is not viable for a vessel with no quota in the North sea to go there on the offchance of catching a few boxes of mullet. It is not sound economic sense. If there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
interest from other member states, licences could be bought. It was much easier to do that before the loophole was closed with economic links, for example, although there was little interest in doing that, apart from on the part of the Dutch in relation to the beam trawler fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the importance of the Shetland box, and we will be arguing for it. I also agree that grading at sea is environmentally damaging. We have introduced restrictions to limit grading at sea because it is so wasteful, and we recognise the need to control such procedures. In relation to the viability of the Scottish fleet, the most recent decommissioning round is estimated to have taken some 20 per cent. out of the whitefish fleet. That is a large reduction that will help viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives is correct in the approach that he has been taking. I do not underestimate the fact that negotiations on the common fisheries policy review will be tough. There are differences of opinion, as is right and proper in a democratic framework. We in the UK are quite clear about the way forward, and we are pleased to have common ground with the UK fishing industry about the type of changes for which we will argue.

I look forward to the hon. Member for Congleton spelling out Conservative policy on nationalisation. Conservatives support nationalisation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, is it national control?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentions drawing lines down the middle of the sea, but that is what happens with the current limits. I remind her that the exclusive economic zone was introduced by a Labour Government. Before then, there were only the six-mile fishing limits. Other EU countries have a historic tradition of fishing in shared waters as long as that of the UK, and I would be interested to see how the hon. Lady would clear their fishing fleets out of our waters, where they have long and historic rights. Some of those matters need to be changed by unanimous agreement, so she is setting herself rather an ambitious target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned lines in the sea because, if we are going to be dogmatic about a 200-mile limit, that includes Paris. Including Paris in the limit will not do much for Anglo-French relations. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Congleton is right. We are talking about median lines. I was making a serious point. It is not possible to have one policy on one side of a median line and another on the other side and believe that that will not impact on the management of stocks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CFP is failing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that the policy needs to be reformed, but in the case of, for example, industrial fishing—in respect of which we have brought about changes and restrictions through negotiation and the CFP—if we had exclusive limits, whatever happened on the other side of that line, people could fish away to their heart's content, with all the damage that that might do to the North sea ecosystem.

We must have a thought-through European-wide management approach. We shall not achieve that by trying to go off on our own and secure unanimous agreement on a treaty change. Not only is that not possible, but it is not necessary if we can make the changes for which we are arguing and have the rationale of a European-wide fisheries management scheme with much more member-state flexibility. That is what we are arguing for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has a lot riding on his shoulders. If he does not bring about what he says that he wants, he will have failed, and the CFP will continue to fail. Areas of the world in which regeneration of marine resource has been successful have not been controlled as suggested in the proposal with which we are not yet involved but might be at the end of the period. I wish him the best of luck. He has one hell of a mountain to climb, and I hope, on behalf of the British fishing industry, in which I am genuinely interested, that he succeeds. However, I shall not hold my breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All sorts of things are riding on my shoulders. This is just another one. I believe that I have the potential for more success in negotiating these changes than in seeking a unanimous treaty change, which is a rather bigger mountain than the one that I face. I believe that we will make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must agree a framework for change and convince people that this is the right approach. It will be an evolving process. However, we are clear about the direction in which we want to go, and we believe that the Commission is right in the direction that it is suggesting in its proposals. We look forward to the final proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is inevitable that satellite monitoring will be extended. That was always the suggestion when it was introduced. We shall have to discuss the matter with the industry, including the question of electronic log books. Benefits to the industry are involved, as well as management issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not make sense to subsidise new fleets, and I worry whether, for example, a new subsidised deep-water fleet in the Republic of Ireland, at the very time when deep water stocks are under real pressure and taking a real hammering, is right. We need to consider those issues carefully. However, I accept that a case can be made for issues such as crew comfort, safety and quality management on board vessels. Indeed, they are already catered for under our FIFG programme and our objective 1 programme in Cornwall.

On the bass fishery, I am pleased to hear that the hon. Member for St. Ives will meet the French ambassador. I have written to the French Minister responsible to offer to share our information on our research. It is a common problem, and we need to approach it in a common way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased with the constructive response that we had from Commissioner Fischler on the subject of dolphin by-catch. We need to do more work on the development of the trail net that is undergoing trial, although we are confident that it is a commercial success and catches fish. We must also continue work
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
on whether it is successful in allowing dolphins to escape. That work will have to go on into next winter's fishery. It would be nice if there were an Anglo-French project. I know that our scientists are interested in approaching French scientists about a collaboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that an Anglo-French—or rather, British-French, as I am Cornish—working group would be most welcome. He mentioned that UK scientists introduced proposals for such a collaboration. How far have those negotiations gone, and is there a possibility of joint work with the French industry in next winter's fishery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are early stages. The lead scientific department is the sea mammal research unit, which has done work on that fishery and the dolphin by-catch on our behalf. It will evaluate the results of the trial net so far, and will share that information with other scientists. We are willing to collaborate, and the Commission may wish to sponsor further work on a joint approach for this winter's fishery. I should be happy to talk to Commissioner Fischler about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, the signs are that the net is promising. Unfortunately, the trial was delayed for 10 days because the rather expensive underwater camera dropped off the net, and there was a delay in getting another one, which is a bit unfortunate. However, we have gained some useful information from the trial, even though it was towards the end of the season and there were no dolphins about. However, the underwater camera filmed a tope, a species of shark, which was successfully ejected through the escape
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
hatch. If it works on that, there is a good chance that it will work on dolphins, but we still needs further trials.

I appreciate the comments of hon. Members. We have scrutinised matters well. One of the valuable functions of the European Standing Committee is that it allows the House to discuss such issues. It will be a busy year for fisheries, what with the recovery programmes and the CFP negotiations, on which I am certain that hon. Members will have views. There are sure to be further opportunities this year for hon. Members to make their views known, and for me to report back on the progress of the negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents No. 14130/01, draft Council Regulation fixing for 2002 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required, No. 15238/01, draft Council Regulation fixing for 2002 the fishing opportunities for deep-sea fish stocks, and No. 6918/02, draft Council Regulation establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks; recognises that a number of fish stocks have fallen to particularly low levels; notes the Government's success in negotiation TACs which take full account of scientific advice while securing the best possible fishing opportunities for UK fishermen; recognises that action is required to constrain fishing effort in relation to deep-sea species; and supports the Government's attempts to secure a European agreement that will return these species to long-term viability.</p></blockquote></p>
