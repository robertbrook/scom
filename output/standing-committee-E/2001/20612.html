	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are tens of thousands of chemicals currently in use about which we have insufficient data to prioritise the hazards and potential risks to human health and the environment. The existing systems are too slow and were not designed to address that fundamental problem. The need for the European Union review and more effective legislation is a high priority and one that I strongly support. The chemical industry is also fully signed up to the objective of effective regulation designed to minimise the risks to consumers and avoid damage to the environment. It is clearly in its interest to take—and to be seen to take—a responsible approach. However, the chemical industry has expressed concerns about the burden of the new legislation, which it believes can act as a barrier to innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European legislation on chemicals has been implemented in a rather piecemeal fashion over the past 30 years. Many parts of that policy are viewed as relatively successful, but the procedures on chemicals have been too slow and have attracted criticism from various quarters, including the chemical industry. The existing substances regulation, which covers high production volume substances, has so far prioritised 140 chemicals to undergo assessment and appropriate risk management. Only one proposal has as yet been adopted for risk management. Because of the slow progress, I called for a discussion on European chemicals policy at the informal meeting of Environment Ministers at Chester during the United Kingdom presidency in 1998 and published the UK chemicals strategy in December 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the mandate from Chester, the Commission produced the White Paper that is the subject of this debate. Entitled "Strategy for a Future Chemicals Policy", it proposes a new system called REACH—the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals—which would apply to both new and existing substances. That system will shift more of the responsibility on to industry, thus freeing authorities to regulate the chemicals of most concern. However, that must be achieved in a sustainable way. Clearly, we need to work closely
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
with industry in developing proposals for new regulations so that the economic and environmental objectives that lie at the heart of sustainable development can be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first phase—registration by manufacturers or importers—would apply to about 30,000 chemicals produced at above 1 metric tonne per year. Registration would be phased in between 2005 and 2012 depending on production volume, with higher volumes first. Given the comprehensive coverage of registration, it will be essential to avoid duplication, especially of testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evaluation would be carried out by authorities on the 5,000 or so substances whose production exceeds 100 tonnes, as well as on those of lower tonnage where there is cause for concern. The Commission proposed fixed and potentially onerous data-generation requirements for substances above 1,000 tonnes and above 100 tonnes to be completed by 2005 and 2008 respectively. It is right that we should set those tough deadlines, but it is important that we ensure that they are deliverable. Authorisation would apply to substances of very high concern. In the White Paper model, those are substances with the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants, and substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a need to establish scientifically valid tests and criteria for the identification of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The Commission proposes further research on substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and that are very persistent and very toxic to decide how they are to be treated. It would be for industry to justify the need for specific uses of a chemical. For other substances, it is proposed that where industry's preliminary risk assessment demonstrates concern, a targeted risk assessment would be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission foresees a central entity to administer the scheme, with member states broadly retaining their existing responsibilities. Other policy objectives for the proposed strategy are increased transparency, integration with international efforts on the safety of chemicals, and promotion of non-animal testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a substantial discussion of the White Paper at the Environment Council in June last year and 50 conclusions, which mainly supported the Commission's approach. Widely diverse views were expressed during the European Parliament debate. The final conclusion was endorsement of the White Paper except that only carcinogens, mutagens and substances toxic to reproduction would be subject to authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on the European Union in the other place considered the Commission's proposals in its report "Reducing the Risk—regulating industrial chemicals", which was published in March. The Government consider that several issues should be given a high priority in taking forward the European Union White Paper. First, we must regain public confidence in chemicals. There must be a streamlined prioritised system that places a responsibility on industry to show that their chemicals are safe,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
urgently identifies chemicals of concern, and takes early risk-management action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we need to encourage innovation and to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry, while addressing the urgent need to obtain information on existing chemicals. The REACH system must be streamlined and workable and place the minimum regulatory burden on industry necessary to protect human health and the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, animal testing must be minimised, and required only where it is needed to ensure adequate control of chemicals and not just for the sake of it in order to fill data gaps. Fourthly, there must be greater provision of information to the public, and, fifthly, there is a need for the EU to work closely with international partners and to ensure that its proposals are consistent with World Trade Organisation rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has not yet come forward with its proposals, but at a recent stakeholder discussion, Commissioner Wallström stated that drafting was under way, with the intention to present the proposal in the summer or shortly afterwards. I recommend that the Committee support the process, with the caveats that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that these should be brief and asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend the Minister for being the promoter of the Government's chemical strategy. As the Department accepts, understanding some of the effects of chemicals is poor and consequently it is sensible to have a Government and EU-wide strategy. Can the Minister say how the strategy will meet the five key demands of the Copenhagen chemicals charter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We very much support the Copenhagen charter. The five points to which the hon. Gentleman refers are, first, that the public must have a full right to information about chemicals. It is right not to blind the public with science or gobbledegook or to give the impression that there is something to hide, and a happy mean should be possible. Secondly, there should be deadlines for achieving the data on chemical safety, but we should not allow the process to drift indefinitely. Thirdly, we should phase out persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals. That issue has been raised in the European Parliament and may be taken up later by other hon. Members. Fourthly, there is the substitution principle of substituting more hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives and, fifthly, we should try to stop the releases of hazardous chemicals. Those are all sensible and achievable objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said at the beginning that the chemical industry is fully signed up. We have all undoubtedly received from the Chemical Industries Association a letter, which says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the industry completely endorses the aims of this policy but has very substantial reservations about the means proposed".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Will my right hon. Friend answer the first of their worries, which is that we
	<br><blockquote><p>"must stick to risk assessment as the basis for decision-making—not qualitative judgements"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of British policy has always been risk assessment, although many continental member states believe that hazard assessment—considering the inherent hazard in a substance—should also be taken into account. I repeat our view, which has always been that the substantive point is not inherent hazard, but the assessment of local and particular circumstances in which a chemical is used and the risks therein. That remains the essential consideration and will continue to drive the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the importance of avoiding the duplication of testing in order to minimise the exposure of animals to additional testing. However, we must accept that this move will increase the number of tests on animals. What steps would the Minister like to see taken to remove duplication of testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Data sharing between companies is important in preventing unnecessary duplication, which increases the number of animal tests. The test packages under the REACH system should also be proportionate. One can always ask for endless amounts of new data, but the data collected should be adequate for the purposes and no more. Once collected, the data should be made freely available so that everyone is not required to carry out the same test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of commercial confidentiality, which will apply in some cases. Unfortunately, however, in other cases it might be used as an excuse for not making data available in some cases. We must understand that the animal testing will be substantial, as our estimate is that a base set of information might require the use of 168 animals and 42 fish. Whether the testing is in excess of 100 tonnes or of all 30,000 chemicals, the figures will be large. They should be minimised as far as possible, and we are in strongly favour of data sharing and proportionate and reasonable common-sense data packages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Janet Dean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What can be done to increase public awareness of the chemicals that are in food? I welcome the Government's commitment to greater information to the public and echo the comments of the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) about limiting animal testing. What plans are there to give the public more information about the contents of food?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has long been a policy of the British Government that there should be greater availability of information to the public about chemicals. Chemicals have an important function in the economy and society, but increasingly people want to know what they are imbibing, and we think that they are entitled to know that. We need to go beyond current EU strategy in this respect, so that manufacturers and downstream users provide comprehensive information to consumers and workers—those who are exposed to the chemicals in the course of production are also very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Information should be available, including on request. We are talking about information on the package, bottle or whatever the container is. Of course, that has to be agreed. A long string of Latin names would not mean much, but it is possible to have a protocol that sets out the level and degree of specificity of information in a clear, reasonable and common-sense manner. We will consider that. The REACH system will certainly ensure that more information is made available about the properties of hazardous substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One objective of the process is to restore confidence in the chemical industry and perhaps in Government as providing people with the information that they want. That is not a burden, but should be part of an outreach to the public to assure them that they have nothing to fear from the process, a risk assessment has been made and full information is available as they need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the explanatory memorandum of 23 March 2001. Paragraph 18 refers to the cost of testing and indicates that the most recent estimate—I accept that this is more than a year out of date—is 2.1 billion euros, but that that is likely to be an underestimate. Will the Minister give us an idea of what he currently believes will be the cost of testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am pleased to do so. There have been many estimates, and I do not think that any is totally reliable. The assessments differ widely, and I will not say, "You pays your money and you takes your choice." People should look at the sources and make a judgment as to which they believe is most trustworthy. I do not think that any of the assessments is dishonest, but they differ significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business impact assessment estimates the direct costs to be £900 million to £4.4 billion, which I think is consistent with what the hon. Gentleman said. The White Paper issued by the Commission estimated the costs at £1.3 billion over 11 years, which I think is also roughly the figure that he quoted in euros. The Government, in our partial regulatory impact assessment, estimate the cost to UK industry to be about £400 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about costs, however, it is important to remember that a cost-benefit analysis has another side to it: the benefits that will come from the policy. The regulatory impact assessment also established that the benefits to human health in terms of occupational exposure might be about £1.3 billion over 10 years. We are not talking about only a burden or cost; substantial benefits will arise from the policy. Those are the best figures that I can offer the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the proposals, I have one point to put to the Minister. Paragraph 43 of the regulatory impact assessment says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"small firms will on average produce proportionally fewer chemicals, and will export to fewer countries … Thus, the costs are unlikely to be disproportionate."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
That shows a misunderstanding of the fact that larger companies will easily be able to set up regulatory procedures that comply with the regulations. Smaller companies that export irregularly, however, will have to endure disproportionate costs and invest a disproportionate amount of time in complying with the regulations. I cannot think of a clever way of getting around that, but does the Minister, and what are his thoughts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Undoubtedly, large companies are generally in a better position to be able to comply with regulatory requirements within the terms of their budgets. Many small and medium-sized enterprises find that more difficult. Larger companies are primarily involved here, although some key niche smaller companies have obligations under the REACH system. Such companies are best assisted if they can share the costs of providing information for the new system. In other words, providing that information themselves maximises their exposure, but if they can find a way of combining with other companies in their trade sector to provide the information jointly, the costs would hopefully be substantially reduced. The Government are certainly concerned to see that happen. Like all systems, this is designed to protect public health and the environment, not to burden business and cause problems. If we can find a way of reducing such burdens, we will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the chemicals policy is in place, new members of the EU, too, will have to stick to it. Will they be given a period of grace, or will they have to adhere fully to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any accession countries must adhere to the rules of the club. There is no question of any reduction of their obligation. It is understood that some countries may find that difficult, and it is a matter of negotiation as to whether there should be a transitional period for them so that they can achieve the full rigorous requirements of the environmental acquis. However, there is no question of them being given any exemption from this or any other EU measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensuring that companies share information on tests once they have been carried out. However, I am also concerned that some other firm in Europe may already have gathered much of that information, which may be unavailable to other firms for the time being. Without that information being known, unnecessary tests may be carried out on chemicals that have already been tested elsewhere. What steps are the Government likely to take to ensure that we have gathered as much information as possible before there is any new testing of chemicals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to that point. I would like to see a pooling of information, although that will not readily happen unless some regulatory force drives it. It is a matter for the Commission or the international chemical companies in the United States, Japan and the EU to agree that information should be pooled before further information is sought so that there is a clear understanding of what repository of data is already available. I am keen to see that.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
However, I repeat that it is one thing to discuss the pooling of information with companies. Many of them would adhere to that, but further regulation is required if it is to be comprehensive. We need to raise that issue when we see the Commission proposals, or indeed to lobby the Commission before it produces its proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sandra Osborne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps will be taken to ensure that EU policy is integrated to take account of international aspects in the safe use of chemicals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The policy must be undertaken internationally. We are talking about 30,000 chemicals, and only a handful have been properly risk assessed under the sort of management system under discussion. It is not possible for any of the three countries or continents—North America, Japan or the EU—to do the job alone: it must be done on a co-operative basis, and the International Council of Chemical Associations is closely co-operating. The EU is not attempting to work alone, but on the basis of allocating responsibility for risk assessment between the three main blocs and the companies within them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to my earlier question, the Minister referred to the benefit side of the White Paper and the regulations before us today. May I draw his attention to a document received earlier this week—a regulatory impact assessment sent by his former colleague, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no health and safety benefits to the UK … There are no cost savings … There are no direct benefits to human health or the environment"—</p></blockquote>
all that for a measure estimated to cost between £1.4 billion and £15.5 billion in year one. I find those costs more overcooked than undercooked, because of the flimsy methodology in the assessment. The 10-year costs are estimated at between ££11 million and £36 million. The regulation is therefore costly, yet it will provide no benefits—health and safety or environmental—to this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now have in front of me the document to which the hon. Gentleman referred. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no health and safety benefits to the UK, although there may be some indirect (unquantifiable) benefits due to information exchange (notification of imports of chemicals banned or severely restricted in other countries). It is envisaged that there will be some health and safety benefits to those countries outside the EC who are in receipt of the chemicals listed in Annex 1."</p></blockquote>
It is perfectly fair for the hon. Gentleman to quote the document, which is a statement from a former recent member of the Government. The Commission's own document, however, rightly points to the better management of chemicals and the prevention of chemical contamination of the environment and the reduction of the impact of exposure on human health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable gains are likely to result from a better understanding of chemicals—particularly of the persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic chemicals, the carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction chemicals and the endocrine disrupters. Everyone fingers those as potential candidates for the authorisation process. If we could carry out the scientific work to establish that that was justified, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
removal, phasing out or restricted use of those chemicals would unquestionably benefit human health and the environment. It is difficult to cite a specific figure—I am merely quoting the Commission—but benefits are likely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would international co-operation also involve the exchange of information about testing? More information about what tests have been done on products should further reduce the need to use animals for testing purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. We are keen to see a maximum exchange of information, not just within the UK or the EU, but worldwide. That must be achieved through agreement. With the agreement of member states, the Commission can regulate within the EU, but cannot require chemical companies in Japan or North America to provide the information. Overall, it is a sensible way to proceed. The UK is probably the country that is the most sensitive to animal testing. I believe that we are right and that others should be more concerned. We would press for procedures to minimise animal testing or any form of cruelty or ill welfare to animals above what is strictly necessary for the purposes of the REACH system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating a strategy for a future chemicals policy. Will the Minister tell the Committee how, after this debate, discussions will progress? How will the conclusions become law? Will it be through a directive or some other means, and what will be the time scale for that? I am particularly worried about the proposed deadlines for registration. The earliest is 2005, which is a very short time from today let alone from the point at which, if we have to go through the full legislative process, the regulations may become law. Instead of setting a date, would it not have been better to stipulate that registration had to commence a certain period after the regulations became law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am as keen as the hon. Gentleman for progress to be made. The Council conclusions on the White Paper called on the European Commission to present its main proposals for a new regulatory framework by the end of 2001. Proposals are not now expected until the end of this year, so there has already been slippage of roughly a year, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will work closely with the Commission in developing its proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay does not indicate that the Commission is losing interest or is not making the required effort, but simply that the task is huge. It may be very necessary, but it is a huge task to conduct a scientifically rigorous and accurate assessment of 30,000 chemicals. A lot of work needs to be done to get the system right. We are keen to press for proposals as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the existing regulations will be enforced until they are replaced by the new legislation—there is no vacuum. However, given the time it takes for the chemicals to go through the existing substances regulation, it will be necessary to have a sensible transitional arrangement to avoid wasted effort. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am the first in Government to say that this is a very slow process and we should use all means to speed it up— without any compromise in scientific rigour, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Government, in the motion, recognise
	<br><blockquote><p>"the implications for the competitiveness of the European Union chemical industry".</p></blockquote>
They want to take account of that. We have heard about the potential cost and the benefits of the measure to society as a whole, and I am among those who see its benefits. However, I am keen to know what assessment has been done of its effect on the competitiveness of the European chemical industry compared with chemical producers in other parts of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to achieve a purpose that I hope is universally accepted—better protection of human health and environment—but in a way that does not undermine, and might possibly enhance, competitiveness. How does one achieve that? One objection to the scheme is that there might be some brake on innovation. It has been agreed to revise the registration house threshold for new chemicals from 10 kg to 1 tonne under the REACH system. That ought to aid innovation, and it will assist small and medium-sized enterprises. Obviously, we will stay in close touch with the chemical industry on the matter. There have already been extensive discussions. I repeat that we do not want a barrier to competitiveness. If we can find a way of achieving our purposes that avoids in any way diminishing competitiveness in the industry, we will be happy to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very broad scheme—as the Minister said, it covers up to 30,000 chemicals. The Chemical Industry Association says that the proposals are for a hugely expansive and bureaucratic system, and argues that a simpler, more focused and proportionate system could be developed, which would be targeted on the relatively few substances that are of deep concern. Is that not a legitimate point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a legitimate point, and we entirely support it. We want proportionate data set packages to be proposed, not an all frills, all song and dance show. We want the scheme to be focused on what strictly needs to be known, and we want clear priorities. I do not think that there is much dispute. Everybody agrees that, at least initially, PBT, CMR and endocrine disrupters are those about which we should be concerned. Considerable work has already been done, for example, on endocrine disrupters in those cases in which people believe that there is sufficient evidence that they can cause adverse effects. An obvious example is tributyltin oxide. Many have already been identified. Those are the ones that should be risk assessed first, so that a decision can be taken and the authorisation system applied if that is appropriate. That is what we intend to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper stresses the promotion of non-animal testing as a means of doing that. In paragraph 2.2 on page 7, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission will therefore promote further development and validation of non-animal test methods."</p></blockquote>
The Minister's proposals stress that too. What concrete steps will the EU and the British
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Government take to promote the development of non-animal testing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had answered that. As a principle, there should be sharing of data so that other companies do not unnecessarily undertake the same tests and so that data set packages are made commonly available. The hon. Gentleman referred to the idea of a repository of data. We do not seek to replicate it but to build on it and supplement it as necessary. That is the essential way in which we can ensure that no unnecessary work is done. We shall promote that strongly with chemical companies and, in case there are any doubts, within the EU. The figures that have been given are extensive—some of them are way over the top—but there is no doubt that there will be a substantial increase in animal testing. I do not want animals to suffer, and I shall be extremely concerned if that increase is any more than strictly and absolutely necessary. I want to put it on record that animal welfare has been undervalued and underestimated in policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ludlow pre-empted my question so I shall move on to different territory. Can the Minister outline whether the White Paper, in its objectives and its directives to member countries, exceeds the terms of the Rotterdam convention on exchange of information concerning chemicals, which I think is driving this process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it does. The Rotterdam convention on prior informed consent procedures was signed in 1998. It empowers countries to decide which chemicals they want to receive and to exclude those that they believe they cannot manage safely. That is important for trade. However, the EU White Paper takes the process of risk assessment substantially further. That is a related issue; it is not built on the Rotterdam convention. It has been acknowledged for many years that the basic problem concerns not trade but the assessment of basic chemicals. There are about 1,100 high-volume production chemicals, many of which we use every day, but which have never been properly and systematically risk assessed according to scientific procedures. That is the heart of the process, and it was taken account of for the first time in our policy after the Chester council in 1998 and subsequently in the EU White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister stressed how important it is that regulations should be international. To what extent has it been possible for the proposals to be discussed and agreed so that they are co-ordinated as closely as possible with those of the large economies of United States and Japan? Might there be a danger that, although the more advanced and prosperous countries will have good clear regulation, much of the rest of the world will be left behind? In addition, to what extent is it possible to co-ordinate regulations with the United Nations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair point, although it is difficult to deal with in practice. There has been extensive co-ordination through the International Chemical Companies Association, resulting in an agreed allocation of who will take responsibility for risk assessment of particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
chemicals and make information available. That process is ongoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the rest of the world, especially the southern states, there are real issues about capacity building. There is no doubt that the technological capability of those countries to undertake such work is unavailable at present. Another issue that needs resolving is the trade of finished products or articles imported into the EU—or other northern states—that contain substances restricted within the EU. We have not found a resolution, and further work is needed to establish a workable system that is not over-bureaucratic and does not burden retailers unreasonably. That system is some way from being established, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister a little further on the response that he has just given. He said that dealing in the EU in imported products that might contain substances was a thorny issue. It has clear implications for the competitiveness of the industry in this country and throughout the EU. Our chemical industry employs some 240,000 people and represents some 2 per cent. of our GDP, so it is no small matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that more work needs to be done, but will he give us some idea of the Government's initial thinking on the matter? People in the industry would be eager to hear exactly what direction the Government are taking on that thorny issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are taking the direction that I have already described. I was at pains in my previous answer to say that we did not have such a system, as far as I know, and that it does not exist anywhere in the world. After all, the process is relatively novel. Even after one or two years, only one out of 140 chemicals in process in the United Kingdom has been dealt with—although those figures may be incorrect, in which case I shall return with the correct figures. In any case, the proportion involved is tiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wants to know what will happen with imports within the EU when the process is in full flow—which will be some years in the future—and when, as a result of the risk assessment, there will be candidates for the authorisation process under the REACH system and when specific bands or restrictions will be in use. That is a perfectly fair and proper question, but we are some way away from that happening. We shall not devise a system without close collaboration with business. I give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that the Government will not devise any system without working closely with business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rob Marris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of exports from the EU, allegations have been made in the past that medicines that the EU has decided are unsafe have been dumped elsewhere, especially in the so-called third world. Under the system, some 30,000 chemicals will be gradually tested. What plans are there for restricting or banning exports to the third world of the chemicals that are found to be more hazardous than was thought, of which there may
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
be stockpiles, when we find out how unsafe they are, so that we do not export hazardous material?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another important point. It is already the case in the EU with regard to hazardous waste, which is an analogous area, that there are proposals for hazardous substances that cannot be used in the UK. Those refer not directly to chemicals but to preventing certain substances from being exported to third world countries for dumping. I would envisage that the same process would apply if there were restrictions on use, or if there were, as a result of the authorisation process, a belief that a chemical should be phased out or banned. It would follow from that that there should also be a notification for export and that any such chemicals should not be allowed to be used abroad. It is very important that what is right for us should be right for third world countries as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me take the Minister back to my last question. I probably did not explain myself properly. The White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission will therefore promote further development and validation of non-animal test methods."</p></blockquote>
We are not just talking about the data being collected, and ensuring that tests are not needed. I am presuming from the above statement that we are looking at artificial skin being used in the tests, or artificial body parts being used instead of animals. The White Paper talks about the Commission taking steps to promote further development. I would have assumed, in light of what the Minister is saying, that the British Government will want to do that. That is why I was asking whether concrete steps are being taken by the EU and the British Government to promote and enhance those methods. After all, there is a tendency in industry to use what it knows already for testing—in this case, animals—and not to invest in finding new methods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not understand what the hon. Gentleman wanted. We are looking to promote research on non-animal tests. I would like to give him a string of examples, but it is fairly early work. However, it is something that we intend to proceed with. We also want to accelerate the validation and acceptance of such non-animal tests, and we want wide recognition of data from other trading blocs or regulatory regimes. I do not think that I am able to give a specific answer on what kind of non-animal tests are currently available. Work is being done on that. If he writes to me I may be able to provide detailed, technical data that are not currently available to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the military in any way involved in, or affected by, the chemicals policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The military are certainly affected by it, as indeed is every other part of society. If my hon. Friend is referring to the use of biological weapons or chemicals for military purposes, all I can say is that there is no exclusion of chemicals from the risk assessment process on the grounds that they might be used for military purposes. There are no intentions to provide any exceptions at all. That does not circumscribe what may be done with the risk
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
assessment data, once obtained. That would normally be fed into the authorisation process under the REACH system for decisions about whether there should be bans on specific usage. There would be an automatic prohibition on the data being used for military purposes. However, that is very far from the purpose behind the process. That concerns protecting ordinary people's human health, and protecting the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no more Members wish to ask questions, we will proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 6671/01, Commission White Paper on a Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy; recognises the need to protect human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals including endocrine disrupters; agrees that the weaknesses of the current legislation, including the lack of data and slow progress in assessing hazards and risks from chemicals already on the market, must be addressed; welcomes the proposals to ensure transparency and improved public access to non-confidential information and that the responsibility is placed on manufacturers and importers to assess hazard and exposure and perform preliminary risk assessment; endorses the Government view that requirements for animal testing must be minimised and alternatives to animal testing promoted; recognises that the proposals must take account of the implications for the competitiveness of the European Union chemical industry; recognises that proposals must be ambitious but achievable and provide a system that is workable and cost effective with minimum regulatory burden.—[	<i>Mr. Meacher.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main objective of any new chemical strategy must be to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment, while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry. I accept that the document is an important initiative by the Commission. It concerns a step-by-step approach to phasing out and developing alternatives to dangerous substances that cause cancer, accumulate in our bodies and environment, and affect our ability to reproduce. For that, the document is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that we obtain and collate reliable information that will allow us to start analysing the many chemicals on the market about whose effects on the environment or our health we know next to nothing. Indeed, we would all agree that the initiative is long overdue. The proposals should also create a more effective internal market for chemical products and thus help industry. My reading of the proposals is that innovation should be stimulated and industry should be assured of a clear framework in which to work. However, unless other global players have parallel regulation, I question whether our companies can work on a competitive footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure worldwide that there is no conflict between balancing the essential need to protect human health and promote a non-toxic environment with the requirement to maintain and enhance innovation and the competitiveness of our and the EU's chemical industry. It is right that the proposals seek to increase transparency by improving access to information on chemicals and increasing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
transparency of the decision-making process. As chemical production and trade constitute such a global industry, it is obvious that integrated international efforts are essential. The trans-boundary impact of certain chemical substances has made chemical safety an international issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that the proposals' guiding principle is the precautionary principle and that an important objective is to encourage the substitution of dangerous by less dangerous substances where suitable alternatives are available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also confirm that the key elements of the new strategy include, first, the production of a single efficient and coherent regulatory framework that provides equivalent knowledge about the hazards of substances marketed before and after September 1981 and their uses—that will provide coherence in the level of protection—and secondly, the reversal of responsibility from authorities to industry for testing and the risk assessment of chemicals, as well as the promotion of innovation and competitiveness without compromising the high level of protection? Finally, will he confirm that a third key element is the introduction of a tailor-made authorisation system in which stringent control is ensured for the most dangerous substances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, will the strategy address the problems inherent in the current system of risk assessment and management of chemicals and attempt to deal in particular with the large quantities of existing substances on the market whose effects on human health and on the environment are largely unknown? Will the Minister confirm that under the new scheme the industry that produces a particular substance will be responsible for supplying data about it and the authorities will be called in to evaluate those data and decide on substance-tailored testing programmes following industry proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What information will be available to the public in the form of understandable labelling, and how literate will the consumer base have to be to understand the information? Do the proposals mean that increased responsibility will pass to users in the manufacturing chain—formulators and downstream users—who will then have to supply data on their uses of a substance? How can the Minister reassure the EU chemical industry that chemical industries in other parts of the world will not use data gathered by the EU industry through expensive tests to enable them to produce cheaper products? Is he confident that the proposed new system for assessing existing and new chemicals— REACH—is adequately comprehensive? It includes registration, evaluation and authorisation, but omits many other substances—especially PBTs—for further research. I am unclear about why that should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister waxed lyrical, and I have no reason to doubt the need to reduce animal testing, especially the "me too" testing. He talked about data sets being commonly available, which I welcome. However, I worry about the EU industry providing not only EU companies but companies worldwide with information that will enable other global players to produce a cheaper substance that is just as good and just as tested. When he discusses the proposals within the EU,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I urge him and the EU do all they can to ensure that there is a global, not just EU, framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accepted that deadlines for registration have already slipped. We know that the EU may grind exceedingly fine, but it also grinds exceedingly slow. It may be some time before the proposals have any legislative effect. I urge him to suggest to the EU that the deadlines should be a certain number of years from the time that the proposals become law, rather than be fixed for 1,000 tonnes, 100 tonnes, or 1 tonne. That would enable industry to prepare itself properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party supports the proposals, which go a good way towards dealing with many important concerns. However, we also raised questions that the Commission must answer when it introduces its final proposals. The strategy is well overdue, and the proposals are important and useful. We are happy to support them in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the White Paper in principle. Some of our concerns have already been expressed, so I shall move quickly through them. We, too, welcome the Minister's clear commitment to making the provisions work. As he said, Britain may be pushing more than other countries, which is also welcome. Unlike the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), we believe that the benefits far outweigh the direct costs to industry within the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to make the point that we need to know more about benefits and costs. The Government's own assessment provided by a previous Minister suggested that the benefits were hard to quantify, if not non-existent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that clarification, and doubtless others would, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have three main areas of concern. The first is the issue of competitiveness, not within the EU— overall we are reading from the same book—but vis-a-vis chemical industries in other parts of the world. We have already touched on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about competitiveness within the EU, because although some countries within it observe the rules quite well, others do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case, but it is not really the key issue for today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stood up only because I needed to stretch my legs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has touched on a broader point, but we are here attempting to produce a set of proposals that will apply across the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I am concerned about competitiveness in respect of other parts of the world. We have not touched on the need for negotiations with the WTO. If we are to raise standards of testing and ensure that our chemicals are as safe as possible, we should ensure that manufacturers in other parts of the world are meeting similar standards, especially if they want to trade their
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
chemicals with Europe. The danger is that European industry will have to bear the costs of testing products while the rest of the world steams ahead with the cheaper means of production, reducing competitiveness. I want a response to my point about discussions with the WTO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we have been so unsuccessful in ensuring a level playing field for food that securing one for chemicals is unlikely? We have been so unsuccessful that we now import food for which the standards of hygiene and animal care are far lower than in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree, as would everyone here, that we have been less successful with food than we should have been. With chemicals, however, the potential exists to be more successful in negotiations. I suspect that America might take a more sympathetic line towards regulation of chemicals than of food. America clearly does not want to go down the same route as Europe on food standards, yet I suspect that it will want to go down that route on some chemicals. Clearly, if there is some agreement between America and Europe, there is the possibility of wider agreement within the WTO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the time scale, which has been raised again. We fear that this policy will take far too long to implement. We have already heard of some of the potential deadlines that have been set for registration. I wonder whether the final stage will have been reached before the first deadline. An immense amount of work is needed, and although the Minister explained that some chemicals will be prioritised, we must still get the system in place. I would be grateful if he could give us some idea when the process for the first set of chemicals will start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area is animal testing. I welcome the fact that the Minister gave us the figures for the animals and fish per chemical that needed to be tested. By my reckoning, it works out at potentially 630,000 extra animal tests. Many of those could be completely unnecessary. That is a major concern, which I am sure all parties share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stress the three points that I raised during my questioning. First, it is essential that the duplication of tests is avoided. The Minister talked about data sets. We must ensure that there are not pressures within other parts of Europe to try to stop that information being made available. We must resist any such pressures and ensure that the information is widely available. Secondly, we must ensure that any data that have been gathered over the past decades is brought together before we undertake additional animal testing. That might slow the process down, but we have to balance the two objectives. I welcome the commitment perhaps to seek new regulations to ensure that that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister invited me to write to him on my third point. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) will pursue this, as he is our animal rights spokesman. We are keen to see active steps to promote non-animal testing methods. I am concerned that for quite a number of years people have jumped up to demand that, but that is as far as it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
gets. There is a commitment but no firm set of steps or initiatives or perhaps even Government grants to encourage companies. We would welcome a clear indication that the Government are pursuing that agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, we support the White Paper and the Copenhagen charter principles. It is unacceptable that we know so little about so many of the chemicals that are in widespread use today. Indeed, labelling is so often absent. Any steps that can improve the safety of all of us within the EU and the wider world have to be welcomed. I do not believe that the burdens on industry are too great. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak on the matter, but while I welcome the thrust of the policy, hon. Members have expressed strands of concern that I understand and sympathise with. As the hon. Member for Ludlow said, it is unacceptable that so little is known about the risks attached to chemicals, and we need to track down and understand what they are. The starting point for that should be the collation of information; it would a huge mistake to reinvent the wheel across several member states or not to use existing knowledge. If we are to minimise the cost of the regulation, we must find out what information exists, and although I am instinctively loth to support European institutions, a European body that could bring that information together would be invaluable in implementing the directive and in mitigating costs to business. If we are not careful, the costs to business will render the chemical industry in Europe uncompetitive relative to its foreign peers. We need to think about that clearly. I would not want the European industry hampered by unnecessary costs because of lack of information or an inability to use existing data, at a time when companies in America, the far east or elsewhere are not similarly required to assess all chemicals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to ensure that the industry remains competitive, and as part of that we need to be much clearer about the benefits of the measure. In responding to my questions, the Minister set out some of the health benefits. I welcome that reassurance, but the documentation is sometimes reluctant to spell out the benefits. If we are to persuade the chemical industry of the real merits of the proposal, we need to spell them out much more clearly, to the population as a whole and to the chemical industry in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In welcoming the measure, I express those caveats about the cost and the need to substantiate benefits. I am sure that, as negotiations on the matter proceed, the Minister and his colleagues will fight to ensure that we safeguard the interests of not only our population but the chemical industry as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful if brief discussion. I shall try to respond to each of the points. The ones that came across most strongly—all
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
hon. Members who spoke referred to it—were those of cost recovery and of fairness between UK companies that are subject to the system and their competitors abroad. We are extremely keen to ensure that there is no loss of competitiveness on the part of our own industry, which is, as the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) said, a major one. We accept the need for equitable sharing of testing costs and are trying to establish that, but such matters are at an early stage. I wish that I could say that we will proceed to the operative phase in the next few months, but I fear that it will take considerably longer. Equitable sharing of costs will include a pre-registration phase, the formation of consortiums and the setting of cost recovery mechanisms. We also want to provide for international data sharing, allowing foreign companies to bring something to the party, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed), who welcomed the system. He asked me to endorse several points that he made and I readily do so, particularly on the importance of the substitution principle, on adhering to precaution and on the need for a single regulatory framework. Indeed, we have asked the Commission to come up with exactly that as soon as possible. It has been said that the measure amounts to a reversal of responsibility from Government to industry. Frankly, however, the Government never had that responsibility. We cannot conceivably risk assess thousands of chemicals. We do not have the resources, knowledge or expertise to do so. We have to ask the industry to do it, but we must have proper auditing and checks to ensure that the process is undertaken properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked what information would be available to the public and how literate people would have to be. Again, the exact formula whereby that will be provided has not been settled, but people will not have to have PhDs. We are asking for the ordinary man or woman in the street with an intelligent and thoughtful interest in the subject to be given information that is meaningful to them. Those are the criteria, and we shall produce proposals on the basis on which that should be delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the potential disadvantaging of EU industry because other global players can use the data to produce cheaper alternatives. We believe that there must be a proper global approach. Indeed, the UK Government are an active proponent of global chemical management through the United Nations Environmental Programme. Again, that will take time and require regional and national building blocks, but we are well aware of that and are trying to put those blocks in place. In February 2002, the UNEP governing council endorsed the further development of a strategic approach to international chemicals management, and I accept that we must build on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that deadlines have slipped. The EU is producing its proposals a year later than it initially said, and we are extremely keen for it to deliver the regulatory framework by the end of the year. I repeat that it is disappointing that, so far, only 140 chemicals under the existing substances regulation have been prioritised to undergo assessment and appropriate risk
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
management, and that only one proposal has been adopted for risk management. The message I get is that everyone believes that to be far too slow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ludlow, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, said that the UK should not be disadvantaged relative to other countries. I hope that I have answered that point. Questions were asked about the WTO, which of course is not about cost sharing. The WTO is basically about a trading system that avoids unreasonable and inappropriate restrictions and barriers to trade. It does not feature directly in what we are discussing. Cost recovery and equitable sharing of the burden of the risk assessment are not matters that should be undertaken through the WTO. They must be undertaken on the basis of international negotiation between countries and their main chemical companies, which is certainly in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made clear his view on non-animal testing, but I fear that I could not give him examples of exactly how things might be undertaken. I suggest that he take a raincheck, keep checking on the matter and write to me, and I will give him information about how far work has been undertaken. The UK currently spends about £2 million a year directly, and a great deal more indirectly, on basic scientific research in this area. The House of Lords Animals in Scientific Procedures Committee, which also covers alternatives work, is about to report. The European Union research framework programme should also provide money for the research. Serious money and effort are being provided, and I assure him that I will add whatever weight I can, because I feel strongly about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Fareham that we should bring together data that are already available. However, the problem is the companies themselves, which jealously guard their own data and want to get the commercial benefit from the money they put in. We must find a system that induces or persuades them that if they provide that information they will gain from the overall process. The opposite of what is needed would be each individual company carrying out every conceivable test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me a fair and proper question about exactly what the benefits are, which I was not fully able to answer, and I shall ask the Department for information on that. This measure is focused on improving the global environment, whereas the regulatory impact assessment considers only the benefits and costs in respect of the UK environment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
With a little more leisure, I shall try to give a fuller answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—it is rather depressing, but I should make it clear—I have the expected time line. I want hon. Members to understand the speed at which the matter is proceeding, as it will be helpful if the House can use whatever pressure it can to speed things up. Possible consultation on proposals will take place in the last half of this year; Council conclusions and the European Parliament's First Reading might take place in 2003; a common position might be reached under the Italian presidency in the second half of 2003; the European Parliament's Second Reading might take place contemporaneously with that but perhaps extend into the Irish presidency in the first half of 2004; and then, no doubt because the matter is highly contentious—some companies certainly believe that—there may be a conciliation phase and an adoption phase which, on our best-guess time line, could extend to the end of 2004. That is very slow. The dates that I give have to be amended because of the Commission's slippage and the effects of enlargement. There is no question of special concessions to the accession countries, and the whole process of enlargement may have a knock-on effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate. The matter is broadly consensual, although I recognise that there are some serious anxieties, which I share, about competitiveness impacts on UK industry. I shall take account of the points raised in the debate and write further to hon. Members on these or other matters that arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 6671/01, Commission White Paper on a Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy; recognises the need to protect human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals including endocrine disrupters; agrees that the weaknesses of the current legislation, including the lack of data and slow progress in assessing hazards and risks from chemicals already on the market, must be addressed; welcomes the proposals to ensure transparency and improved public access to non-confidential information and that the responsibility is placed on manufacturers and importers to assess hazard and exposure and perform preliminary risk assessment; endorses the Government view that requirements for animal testing must be minimised and alternatives to animal testing promoted; recognises that the proposals must take account of the implications for the competitiveness of the European Union chemical industry; recognises that proposals must be ambitious but achievable and provide a system that is workable and cost effective with minimum regulatory burden.</p></blockquote></p>
