	<p>8.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Before the Minister starts, could someone tell us why the significant amount of documentation on this matter was not available until yesterday morning? No criticism of the Minister or the Government is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am enormously indebted to the Minister's private office, because I obtained the documents from there when I heard, just before the House resumed, that I was to appear on the Committee for the official Opposition. Otherwise, no documents would have come to me at all. I am not a member of the Committee, but I understand from those in my party who are that they had similar difficulties to those mentioned by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). I associate myself with the concerns he has just expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, all members of the Committee received the full set of documents, but others were given incomplete sets. It is not in the power of the Chair to do anything about that. One has to live with the error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Atkinson. This is the third time recently that I have appeared on this Committee in my capacity as an Opposition spokesman on home affairs, and the third time that the Minister has been involved. He can confirm that there have been problems with the documentation on all three occasions. Through the Chairmen's Panel, Mr. Atkinson, you might make representations to the powers that be and tell them that there seems to be a regular problem with the documentation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is nodding. He was present on two of those occasions. It is clearly not a question of the House having just started to sit after the recess. It is not a one-off problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. The problem has occurred in this Committee on three occasions, and the Minister has had the misfortune to be on duty on each of them. I have not found such a problem on other Committees, but it has now become a regular problem. Given that the documentation for issues that have been around for a long time is usually large—today's subject is an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
example in point—it would be extremely helpful if inquiries could be made about why it was so difficult to obtain the documents for this Committee and link that to any other such complaints. Concerns have regularly been expressed about this problem. It is very difficult to prepare when other documents have to be sought, people have to be asked for advice and so on. We cannot do our job as well as we should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One further thought occurs to me, Mr. Atkinson. On the first of the occasions on which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and I were involved, one of your fellow Chairmen had to adjourn the Committee, which then had to be reconvened on another day, because the documents were so voluminous. That was the Committee on the crucial constitutional issue of the European Union arrest warrant. I thought it might help you, Mr. Atkinson, and the Clerks to look back and see the shambles that occurred on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been problems. I hope that the Committee will accept that they have been of a different nature to those complained about today. None the less, I would be more than happy to support a proposal that we consider who is responsible for the distribution of documents and how it is carried out, to make absolutely certain that the Department and the Committee are properly plugged in, and that documentation goes to Committee members and to representatives of the Opposition. There could be a difficulty, so we need to investigate whether liaison is as good as it should be, or whether it could be improved. I support what has been said to that extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members are happy for me to take the matter up with House authorities—I can do nothing about it today—and for the Minister to take it up with the Department, perhaps we can agree to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have already talked about the voluminous papers thrown at us on such occasions. Our debate is based on the European Commission document that describes how it intends to fulfil its part of the European Union's action plan on drugs for 2000 to 2004. The concerns of the Select Committee on European Scrutiny have led to the debate focusing on the action plan as much as the Commission's communication on it. The motion for debate after questions invites us to do three things: to take note of the Commission's document, to welcome the mid-term review of the action plan, and to urge the European Council to revise the plan to ensure that it delivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are no interventions in the opening statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU's approach to the drug problem has three principal instruments. The drugs strategy agreed by the Helsinki European Council in 1998 sets out the structure of the approach, the action plan on drugs for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
2000 to 2004 implements the strategy, and the ongoing evaluation of the action plan includes both mid-term and final evaluations of progress at the EU level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we getting results? The mid-term evaluation will be completed in about two weeks' time. That will give us a complete picture of how fully the action plan is being implemented and what the outputs are. However, the strategy is long term, and the action plan lasts until the end of 2004. The outcomes will become clear only in 2004 when the final evaluation is published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some solid indications of progress. For example, a greater spirit of co-operation is enhancing the joint law enforcement effort. We have some concerns about the action plan, which I will set out along with what the Government are doing about them. I shall focus on some of the progress that has been made. Demand-side performance indicators have been developed, so that we can measure success in tackling the demand for drugs uniformly across Europe. We hope that agreement on tough, common, minimum-maximum penalties for drug traffickers EU-wide will be achieved soon. Progress is being made on closer co-operation on drugs with candidate countries; all have agreed to adopt the action plan as their delivery model for anti-drug action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europol provides an important conduit to encourage joint operations and exchange intelligence. The Justice and Home Affairs Council in June agreed a framework on the use of joint investigation teams between EU law enforcement services, which will make use of those teams easier and should lead to more effective co-operation between law enforcement agencies. Europol-based operations have made seizures of more than 10 kg of heroin, 113 kg of cocaine and 50,000 Ecstasy tablets in the past financial year. Frequent operations involving United Kingdom liaison officers based in EU countries last year resulted in seizures of more than 1,500 kg of heroin, 6,000 kg of cocaine, more than 2 million Ecstasy tablets and more than £460,000 in cash. Nearly €200 million has been allocated to help countries on the main trafficking routes to Europe, and a recent agreement between the EU and Turkey will help to control precursor chemicals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the aftermath of 11 September, the UK is co-ordinating international anti-drugs assistance to Afghanistan, while Germany is leading on police reform and Italy on judicial reform. The Afghan authorities have destroyed 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. of the 2002 poppy crop, so the EU approach to the fight against drugs is yielding some benefits. However, the action plan may not be fulfilling its full potential. Our concerns are practical and structural.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practical terms, we now have common measures on the demand side of the problem. We must develop supply-side indicators quickly, as much more progress is needed in that area. Member states, and the EU as a whole, must strive for still closer co-operation on law enforcement. We now have the joint investigation team framework, and we must begin to use it extensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
We must build on the good progress that has been made with candidate countries, although inevitably many have a long way to go. More progress is needed with regard to Turkey. A pre-accession pact on organised crime lays down a framework, and that must be built upon. The UK has shown the way forward in disrupting Afghan opium cultivation, and Germany and Italy are playing their part. Other member states that have not yet provided assistance should aid the new Afghan administration. We shall press for faster progress on all those fronts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concerns about structural issues relate to the action plan. The key to making progress on practical matters is to get the structures right. The EU should focus on what it can do best: achieving operational and judicial co-operation in supply reduction and enabling the sharing of best practice and information on demand reduction and prevention. The action plan has defined a coherent, balanced package that attacks both supply and demand. It is a common template to ensure that we all work in the same direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, published earlier this month, suggests that that is now happening. It reports national and regional differences across Europe and a common recognition across the EU of what the problems are and how best to tackle them. There is a degree of convergence on the implementation of laws and policies to deal with the drug problem, but the plan could be more effective than it is. It is very broad. It contains a full list of measures to be taken by the European Union collectively—by its institutions and its member states—but it has little in the way of targets, success measures or priorities. That threatens to blow it off course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the plan contains no specific targets, it does not focus on how action at European level can add value. The mid-term review is our opportunity to introduce some purpose and direction into the plan, and we are working closely with the Danish presidency to that end. We have argued that key priorities should be distilled from the plan, with a target date attached to each. If the priority is for action by the European Union or by the relevant European bodies, specific action should be set out, with success measures attached. It should be in the areas in which the EU can add real value to the national effort—joint action in supply reduction and sharing best practice in demand reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the changes for which we are arguing are made, the EU action plan should be able to demonstrate a real achievement at its conclusion, and a joint European effort will have made some difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start the questions, I inform the Committee that, as from the next Session of Parliament, there will be a different system of document distribution. The Vote Office will take responsibility for ensuring that the documents are delivered by the Ministries, and for distributing them. I hope that that system will prevent errors such as have previously arisen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. That is very helpful news, and I am delighted to hear
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
it. Can I take it that the Vote Office will take responsibility for getting all documents not only to Committee members, but to those who are likely to represent their party on the Front Bench, even if they are not members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but perhaps a message will reach me later on so that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Thank you for that indication, and thanks to the Minister for his helpful comments. I hope that a clearly agreed, sensible route for trafficking the documents can be established. Perhaps we should concentrate on that. Colleagues will have noticed— this is not a criticism of Ministers—that the Committee considered the matter a year ago today. It has taken one year from the Scrutiny Committee's saying that this is a political—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair but a question for the Minister. Will the hon. Gentleman leave the question till later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to pursue the matter with the Minister, but it relates to Committee organisation. The matter has not come before this Committee since the Scrutiny Committee recommended that it should a year ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When matters come before the Committee is not a question for the Chair. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other question—it is surprising what comes to you when you sit down—the Vote Office will ensure that the documents are delivered to members of the Committee. Non-members will have to ask for them at the Vote Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can continue with the main business of the Committee. We have until five minutes to 10 o'clock for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There should be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask as many questions as they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first question was half-anticipated by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. It occurred to me, too, that we were exactly 12 months on from when the Scrutiny Committee said that the matter should come before this Committee. What does the Minister have to say about that inordinate delay? Can he shed any light on it, and could he tell us whether the Government played any part in delaying the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not played any part in delaying the matter coming before the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member of long standing, so he knows that channels of communication between the parties schedule the business of the House while taking account of priorities. I do not know what representations, if any, his party made about the delay but, as far as I am aware, the Department did not cause it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister helpfully told us that the mid-term review would be published in a fortnight, or thereabouts. On a linked procedural question, will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
he undertake that if the review is published in Brussels, members of the Committee and others will be alerted to that fact? Will he give an undertaking that there will not be any delay between its publication and its arrival in the system in the UK? We are working on a document that is by definition the original document, so we would benefit from seeing as soon as possible the mid-term review that is welcomed in the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The mid-term review is almost upon us, and this is the Committee's opportunity to make some input into it, albeit at a late stage. There will be no attempt to delay the issuing of documentation. Of course, a workload imposes itself upon the structures of the Home Office, but I shall do my best to ensure that documentation from the mid-term review gets to the people who need to see it, including members of this Committee, as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us where there is any evidence in these documents that the policies pursued in Europe against drugs have produced a reduction in drug harm, in the number of addicts and in drug deaths?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend studies the documentation he will see that it is a little early to consider any outcomes at all. We found the same thing when the drugs strategy was implemented in this country some time ago. We need to identify common measures. He and other hon. Members will surely agree that all the countries that are involved in the problem and making contributions to the solutions need to find a common measure for demand and supply and for assessing the situation. A lot has been done, but what we do not have, and will not have until the end of the evaluation of the action plan, is any idea about the outcomes of the action plan. It is too early to judge that. We are simply trying to arrive at measurable criteria that can be transferred from one jurisdiction to another, so that we can make comparisons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted that the European Scrutiny Committee had particular interest in what kind of "co-operation with Turkey" was envisaged, and whether there had been any progress in negotiations with that country. Since the Scrutiny Committee reported on that more than a year ago, we have had clear indications that, on human rights and other grounds, it is very unlikely that Turkey could be regarded as a genuine applicant country in the foreseeable future. I share the scepticism expressed by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) about whether any of this will do any good, but I ask the Minister whether he thinks that any action with regard to Turkey will be affected by the recent decision that Turkey is so back down the list as to be almost off it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, Turkey has made applications, which increases our ability to influence that country. However, Turkey is a very real part of the problem because it is midway between the supply and demand of 90 per cent. of the heroin that reaches UK streets. There has been some progress in the form of an agreement to try to prevent the diversion of the precursor chemicals necessary for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
the production of heroin. In addition, discussions are taking place on co-operating with Turkey to tackle organised crime. There are ongoing efforts to do more, but the agreement on precursor chemicals plays a useful part in disrupting the supply of heroin to the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My impression from reading the papers is that the wheels grind awful slow and the convoy will move at the speed of its slowest ship, but the matter is urgent. Does my hon. Friend agree that, in this respect, the EU should try to move at the speed of the fastest ship? The best and most effective policies should be adopted quickly throughout the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I do not accept the view of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) that nothing can be done and all this is a waste of time. I do not see how we can think of ourselves as an island in this regard. We must co-operate with our EU partners and try to move things forward as effectively and quickly as possible. It is enormously frustrating that we cannot make faster progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can set some decent priorities and proper targets, our action plans will be more effective. That will take time but, at the moment, the various countries simply do not measure things in the same way, so we cannot compare what we are doing with action taken in other countries. We cannot test which policies are effective and learn from best practice in other countries because there are so many different systems. There is some evidence of policy convergence. We want the EU to put together a framework, which we can properly evaluate. The process is enormously slow and frustrating, but we are pushing to move as quickly as we can and to be as effective as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 2 September, a document was published entitled "Implementation of EU-Action Plan on Drugs 2000–2004—Progress Review for the Member States". It is described as prepared in the framework of the mid-term evaluation. The document is unhelpful in that it reaches no specific conclusion and merely contains a set of reports. Have the Government formed a view of what can be learnt from that document, either about the effectiveness of UK drugs policy or about other drugs policies in the EU? Has a response been prepared or is one in the process of being prepared? If so, can we see it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many conclusions flow from comparisons between the problem in this and other countries. Beyond doubt, the drugs problem in this country is near the top end of the range compared with some of the drugs problems in the EU. There does not seem to be an overall growth in the drug problem in the EU, including in Great Britain, but the problem is far too serious. Certain trends can be identified and useful comparisons can be drawn. For example, HIV infection among needle users is far lower in this country than in the EU generally. However, the lack of genuinely comparable data makes it difficult for us to use analysis from the EU as effectively as we would like. That is why we need the action plan, but I accept that much more needs to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Building on the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), does he agree that subsidiarity needs to be applied slightly differently in this area from the way in which it is applied to other areas of policy? As there is no consensus on the one magic bullet that will cure the drugs problem, we need to encourage diversity of effort throughout the EU, while adopting common measures of success, so that we can identify best practice. If we could ascertain that one particular practice was effective, would the Minister press for its broad adoption throughout the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, although I believe that subsidiarity is an issue because there is no need to operate EU structures where national structures are more appropriate and where the problem is confined within national borders. However, there is an absolute need for good comparative information, if we are to be effective. We are not the experts or repositories of everything that is good in this country, but where we have got something right, it needs to be applied effectively in those neighbouring countries that have an impact on us. There is far more scope for active co-operation on the supply side, where some progress has been made, although not enough. The drugs supply route has an international dimension. Extensive co-operation is necessary so that intelligence can be provided by Europol to enable us to increase our ability to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boris Johnson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Henley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not mind me asking an obvious question. Is it not nonsense to talk about a European action plan on drugs and importing best practice from other countries when we are so far away from having a common regulatory framework, especially for class B drugs, and when, for example, people can go to Holland and buy cannabis? Are there any plans to harmonise the position on class B drugs throughout the EU, perhaps to bring our policy more in line with Dutch policy? If not, is that not a huge lacuna—a hole at the heart of the European action plan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the problem is as central as the hon. Gentleman suggests. There is a problem because we have not yet managed to achieve agreement on minimum and maximum penalties, largely because the Dutch are not happy to accept them in relation to the small-scale supply of cannabis. Difficulties arise because of national decisions, but any objective analysis of what occurs in different jurisdictions in the EU will show that, by and large, there is a convergence of policy, although there are still differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just because a different approach is taken on one drug, it does not mean that the Dutch authorities do not agree with us on the need to intervene effectively against the supply of cocaine from South America and heroin from Afghanistan and the need to share best practice on treatment and harm minimisation. Much can be done that is not controversial, but information about the different methodologies must be freely available to member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had a chance to study the major report on the drug abuse reduction exercise in the United States, which followed up the conclusions of all other independent schemes, including the drug abuse reduction treatment scheme, a massive billion dollar anti-drug education programme? The report's conclusion is that anti-drug education does not have a beneficial effect on reducing drug use. As we will embark on spending money in Europe and this country, is it not time to evaluate things that the Government once celebrated such as Project CHARLIE—chemical abuse resolution lies in education? That is an extraordinary name, but it is what the project is called, believe it or not. Are there any independent reports on that that would justify spending a penny on anti-drugs education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not read the report to which my hon. Friend refers but I am sure that he is winging it on its way to me or that he is getting someone else to do that. I am more than happy to read the report. However, I have heard comments about several drug education programmes, and my hon. Friend's conclusion is different from the one that I, or the majority of people, would draw. He seems to conclude that education cannot make a difference. We cannot draw that conclusion just because particular programmes have failed. I do not understand how we can effectively reduce the drug problem in our country by addressing simply supply and demand, without using an education strand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the education strand that has been pursued has not been as effective as it might have been. We need good education that has an impact and is useful. The message must be good and credible, and delivered effectively. If we get to that position, the education strand of any drug reduction programme will be a vital component. I do not draw the same conclusion as my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to the view that the Minister expressed rather than that expressed by the hon. Member for Newport, West. What is the Government's view on whether the balance in the action plan between reducing supply and concentrating on education and treatment is right? It might concentrate, understandably, on what Europe can do to reduce demand and to control supply but it does not concentrate as much as might be useful on intelligent, discriminatory information education, rather than "Just say no" education, and on ensuring that treatment works for people and gives an early intervention to get people out of the drug cycle. Are the Government sympathetic to that view? Do they think that the action plan could be amended to tilt the balance in favour of things that we can definitely do rather than things through which we probably cannot achieve much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman's intentions, but the documents expose the fact that the reverse is the case. The position in the action plan on demand reduction is probably more advanced and that is not necessarily the area in which the European Union can add value. We need more progress on supply reduction and on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
intercepting criminal activity. We must put that right, and we could use the mid-term review to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My comments on education were about our domestic policy as well as Europe-wide domestic policy. We should explore the amount of cross-border co-operation that will be necessary for education and how much commonality can be agreed because, as the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) rightly said, there is a different emphasis in some jurisdictions. We should be prepared to look abroad to see where policies have been effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked in vain through the documents for scope for radical actions and the possibility of experimentation that will actually work. Following on from my hon. Friends the Members for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) and for Newport, West, will it be possible for radical ideas that would work to be injected into the debate, at least by Britain? Are some of the solutions that might work not considered because they are not politically saleable, rather than because they are not considered intelligent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any chance that the radical ideas supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West will be injected into the plan by the British Government? I do not think so, as my hon. Friend fully appreciates. We jump to too many conclusions if we assume that the route we have chosen cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear: we have not had a drugs strategy for very long that has attempted to tackle both ends— supply and demand—in a systematic way and in conjunction with each other. A marked lack of treatment capacity in this country has undermined our ability to reduce demand. Such issues are being addressed and it is the Government's view that policies need time to take effect. The frustration of hon. Members who jump to the conclusion that we need to do something different and go down the legalisation route is understandable to a degree, but is not shared. We must persevere with a comprehensive attack on all aspects of the problem and we must be prepared to stick at it. It can and will bear fruit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how pleased I am once again to hear the Minister wholly repudiate the well-known views of arch legalisers such as the hon. Member for Newport, West? Are the Government prepared seriously to examine the experience of the Swedish Government in tackling the drugs problem? From my own investigations, over several years, Sweden is the one country that has had significant success, especially with drug education, contrary to the hon. Gentleman's views. The Swedes' advantage is that there is a much lower use of drugs in Sweden, because of the national consensus running throughout the establishment, from the royal family downwards. When talking about injecting clear targets, does the Minister have in mind the sort of targets there are in Sweden? One analysis of Sweden's drug problem states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A general condemnation of drug use as something 'evil' is seen as a crucial prerequisite for a successful drug policy. In 1999, for the fourth time in a row, a big conference and exhibition, "Sweden against drugs" was held. It was opened by the Queen of Sweden,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
with the Minister of Social Affairs as one of the key speakers, and attracted almost 4,000 visitors during 3 days of seminars and discussion."</p></blockquote>
Do the current British Government intend to benefit from the Swedish experience in looking for clear targets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman and the leader of his party visited Sweden some time ago to great fanfare. I listened in vain for the outcome of that visit in the speeches made on the subject last week at their party conference. I could see no difference between what they proposed and the strategy adopted by the Government. I am interested to know whether the hon. Gentleman will say anything radically different when we begin the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence that some countries with tough restrictive regimes have low levels of drug use and some have high ones. There is also evidence that the adoption of a liberal regime can lead to both high and low levels of drug use. Levels of drug use are not solely determined by the methods employed to tackle them: fashion, background and culture are also factors. Simplistic comparisons of our country with Sweden that do not take a broader view do not take us anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mark Tami 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mention has been made that Turkey is unlikely to gain European Union membership. What discussions have there been with other aspiring EU members about drug strategy and policy, especially the old eastern bloc countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the accession states have now agreed to adopt the EU action plan as the framework for their own drug strategies, which has got to be good news because we are all suffering from the problems in those countries and the very existence of the European Union next door only adds to their problems. The Phare programme and others deal with drugs and are intended to help. The drug action plan has been agreed, so data will be available to compare our performance with other countries as well as our European neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever possible, we have sought to extend aid packages beyond the accession states. Contact has been made and some agreement reached between the EU and some central Asian republics that are on the heroin route and suffer from their geographical location. They have tried to build their judicial and treatment capacity and to improve policing. Bilateral measures are necessary. Mutual co-operation and agreements should benefit British and EU taxpayers as well as the countries themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the action plan is weak and inadequate on harm reduction? Pilot schemes in this country have shown how beneficial clinics for treating people on heroin, for example, are. They bring addicts within the system because supplies are received from legitimate rather than criminal sources. Pilot schemes in Cornwall and elsewhere have demonstrated that. Will Ministers seek to incorporate such a policy direction in the proposals, even if only a pilot scheme across the EU to evaluate alternative options for hard drug users? Does the Minister agree that the action plan could be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
strengthened by becoming much more radical in its approach to harm reduction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we believe that what is effective at a European level will largely mirror what is effective in our country. The hon. Gentleman knows that we are examining ways of strengthening harm minimisation within our own drug strategy. That will be reflected in the negotiating position that we adopt in the EU. The hon. Gentleman is partly right: we will be seeking to develop an adequate and effective harm minimisation strand in our drugs strategy, but I do not agree that such a strand is absent from the present proposals. We may be able to analyse that further in future debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following earlier questioning, I detect that the Minister believes that my views are similar to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West. That is not strictly correct. My primary concern is about hard drugs, particularly heroin, which is an important issue in my constituency. Although radical solutions could work in certain circumstances, different solutions are appropriate for different types of drugs. Cannabis and heroin are different, so different approaches may be required, and general condemnation of all drugs may not be effective. Does the Minister agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not attempting to cast any aspersions on my hon. Friend's opinions. He says that radical approaches are right for certain drugs, but he does not tell us what he means by radical. If he clarifies that, I can tell him what the Government's position is. We broadly agree that a different approach is necessary for different drugs, and our emphasis is on dealing with class A drugs. I visited my hon. Friend's constituency the other day, and I have similar problems in my constituency. I have no doubt that the main problems are caused by heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine. That is what causes acquisitive crime, deaths and massive distress in our communities. Of course we need a different and a credible message if we are to be effective on the educational front. Our police and other resources should be directed where they are most needed. I agree with adopting a different approach for different drugs, but I am not sure what my hon. Friend means by radical. If he clarifies that, I will tell him whether I agree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister has in mind, but I direct him to the discussion document by the horizontal drugs working group, which I imagine is a cross-European panel on drug use. I do not know whether he is a member of the horizontal drugs working group, but if he is, or if he knows someone who is, I would like to know what goes on in the group and whether, in listening to discussions about the use of soft drugs as opposed to hard drugs, the Government are taking account of what the Dutch say. What does the Government think about the Dutch experiment and about the differentiation between hard and soft drugs? Has it led to Commander Crackpot and the merriment in Brixton? Is there a stealthy change? The Minister spoke earlier of convergence in policies. Will there be a convergence on class B drugs? Are the Government interested in the Dutch approach and are they tiptoeing towards it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The horizontal group is not called that because it lies down or is spread across the whole of the European Union. It is called the horizontal group because it straddles the different strands of the legislative process in the EU. There are third-pillar issues where national sovereignty is still supreme, and first-pillar and second-pillar issues where there is different legislation. The drugs area affects all those different legislative pillars, which is why it is called the horizontal group. It is because they have to relate to all the different strands of European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a convergence? Are we going Dutch? No, we are not. We made our policy clear in our response to the Select Committee on Home Affairs. It is not intended to be a sliding scale towards some other policy. The Home Secretary proposed the reclassification of cannabis from B to C, not its legalisation or decriminalisation, for two reasons. The primary reason was to get the educational message right, which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West does not think will necessarily have any effect. Young people are not stupid and if the educational message is not based on medical reality, it will not be believed. The harm that cannabis actually does puts it in class C, therefore so should our legislative framework. We will not get through to young people if they think we are saying something that is not true. If they perceive us to be saying that cannabis is as bad, almost as bad, or much the same as crack cocaine they will not listen to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our secondary motive was to try to direct police effort as best we can at class A drugs and to ensure that that is given priority. It has been the priority of the police over the past few months, and there have been some successes. In Lambeth, Brixton and Coldharbour lane there have been concerted efforts to close down what has for some time been an open cocaine market, and there has been some success in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's 1998 drug strategy contained certain targets: reductions of 25 per cent. and 15 per cent. a year. In their most recent pronouncements, those targets seem to be missing. Has there been a change of policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet announced the outcome of the review of the drugs strategy. My hon. Friend cannot provoke me into announcing our response to the reformation of the drugs strategy, because I am far more frightened of the Home Secretary than I am of my hon. Friend, but it will be announced fairly soon. The hon. Gentleman will be able to analyse the changes we have made and to decide whether he agrees with any or all of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the drugs policy should reflect a much clearer view, and that there should be an entirely different approach to soft drugs, perhaps with no penalties? Does the Minister agree that, regardless of whether the Government want to pursue such a policy, the European Union should recognise that some countries may want to decriminalise the use of some drugs—as my party believes is right in relation to cannabis—and that that can be done only if the case is put in the United Nations for the renegotiation of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Geneva convention on narcotics to allow countries that wish to do so to treat certain drugs differently from the way in which they treat other drugs with regard to criminalizing the users?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Portuguese and the Dutch have gone down that road, but they have had to pretend that they are acting within the law, whereas they are in fact breaching international law. Would the Minister consider proposing that the EU should allow countries, if they wish to do so, to opt out of the UN convention on narcotics with regard to soft drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we would need another debate to discuss our stance on the treaties. There are obligations on us as well as on other countries. The hon. Gentleman should not misrepresent the situation in Holland. As he knows, it does not have a decriminalised supply of cannabis; the front doors of its coffee shops are decriminalised, but the back doors are not. The supply is still in the hands of organised traffickers, and I do not think that that is a situation that we would be prepared to see in this country, as it goes against all the principles that we have tried to uphold. If a law exists, it should be effectively enforced. If the Dutch take a different approach, that is to a certain extent a matter for them. However, we do not want to go down the road that they have gone down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Afghan war, the United Nations reported that the Taliban had reduced poppy production in the area that they controlled by more than 90 per cent., but that in the area controlled by the Northern Alliance there was a 300 per cent. increase in the amount of land cultivated for poppies. Has the Minister any news on what has happened after the war? Has there been any reduction in the area of Afghanistan that is cultivated for poppies? Has there been any reduction in the amount of drugs from there that are coming to this country? If the Americans— along with other countries—were to crack down in Afghanistan as they did in Colombia, would we not be in danger of creating a Colombianisation of that entire region of Asia, which would result in wars, drug gangs and drug armies throughout Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Burma and most of Pakistan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has disagreed with me about this matter on a couple of occasions. As I understand the situation in Afghanistan, until the Taliban Government implemented the poppy ban, they were, in effect, encouraging the cultivation of opium poppies—they were farming, and they were taxing it. As a result, some of the biggest bumper crops were produced, and 90 per cent. of the heroin supplied to this country came from Afghanistan during that period. However, my hon. Friend is right that, for reasons that we could argue about, the Taliban implemented a ban on poppy cultivation, whereas during that period poppy cultivation continued in areas that were controlled by the Northern Alliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now moved on from an Afghan Government who were prepared to cultivate, tax and encourage the poppy crop to a Government who have banned the cultivation of poppies and are doing their best to eradicate it. They have not been entirely successful, as I said in my opening remarks. However,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
we believe that they have managed to destroy between 25 and 30 per cent. of the poppy crop this year, and that is a big step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is correct in saying that unless we work effectively with the Afghan Administration, we will not be able to tackle this problem. To be effective, we must be smart as well. If we were simply to impose solutions to the problem of poppy cultivation from outside, we would create as many problems as we would solve. We must work with the Afghan Government and try to provide alternatives. We must provide the necessary assistance, which will not be easy. There are no quick fixes or solutions; we must work at it over time. However, I hope that he will agree that the position is better now, because the current Afghan Administration are opposed to the cultivation of poppies, unlike the previous Government, who were prepared to encourage, foster, protect and tax it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. However, there were strong indications from that Government and from the meetings that I had with senior officials, including the person who until recently was the equivalent of our Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, that many people in Holland feel that their previous policies have failed and that there is a need for revision. The Dutch Government, until yesterday, indicated strongly that those policies might soon be different. Are the British Government taking account of the contrary views in the Netherlands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true to say that there is no settled policy in Holland, and a debate is going on. Part of our problem in getting minimum and maximum penalties agreed was the Dutch Government's position on the coffee shop policy, and the delay has been due to the fact that that Government changed. There was the election campaign and the hiatus caused by that, and as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, we now seem to be entering another such period. We shall continue to negotiate common policies, but in the absence of effective Dutch policy over the next few weeks there will be some delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have seen the annual report of the monitoring centre, which came out at the beginning of this month. That shows that cocaine use is rising faster among young Britons than anywhere else in the EU, that—as the Minister accepted earlier—we regularly emerge as one of the EU's most drug-affected nations, that cannabis remains the most popular drug here, that we top the Ecstasy league across the European Union, that we have more injectors and long-term users of opiates, cocaine and amphetamines than any other country except Portugal, Italy and Luxembourg, and that we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
have long been, in the words of Mr. Trace, the former deputy drug czar:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EU's most drug riddled nation."</p></blockquote>
The general conclusion of the monitoring centre's report was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Levels of problem drug use seem stable although some countries report changes which suggest increases".</p></blockquote>
One of those countries is the United Kingdom. In the light of that, does the Minister conclude that EU policy cannot be successful at the moment if all we are doing is to stabilise the situation, and that British policy has clearly been unsuccessful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The British policy has been changing and the moneys that have been applied to it have changed also. The hon. Gentleman omitted to mention the fact that the use of some drugs—for example, amphetamines and LSD—has reduced considerably in this country. There is some evidence of an increase in cocaine use, which is worrying and very dangerous, but it has been offset by a decrease in the use of amphetamines, LSD and other drugs. The hon. Gentleman suggests that that is a failure of long-term Government policy. There has not been a long-term Government policy. A drugs strategy was put in place in 1998. That is now being reviewed, and substantial increases in spending are attached to all its heads. We have totally inadequate treatment facilities in this country. We are trying to double them by 2008, and are on course to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could make political comments about the party that left us in that state, which now appears to be pledged to a tenfold increase in treatment places. It is good news that it has at least made a change of direction, although I do not know how it justifies its view that a tenfold increase is needed. There has not been a long-term, effectively resourced drug strategy in this country. There is now, and we ought to give it time to see whether it has the effect that we all desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that yesterday, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg, penalties on drug trafficking were discussed. That subject also relates to the strategy. Can the Minister tell us whether anything was agreed? If there was no agreement, when is there likely to be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. However, if possible, I shall do so at the conclusion of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That this Committee takes note of the European Union Document No. 10207/01, Commission Communication on the implementation of the European Union Action Plan on Drugs (2000–2004); welcomes the mid-term review of the Plan; and urges that it should be revised to ensure that priority is given to achievable, timebound targets that will contribute measurably to the European Union's contribution to the fight against drug abuse and trafficking.—	<i>[Mr. Bob Ainsworth.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>9.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drugs is clearly the most important issue that faces law and order in this country, as in others in the EU. No doubt many well-intentioned people produce the voluminous papers to which the Minister referred, but I query whether they are effective. I was glad to hear him say, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, that they feel that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
are not sufficiently firm targets, and that the EU has not got its act together. When I read through the voluminous papers for the debate, I was horrified by the amount of gobbledegook and verbiage, but that comes as no great surprise, as that is what I find whenever I read EU documents. I want to ask the Minister whether he thinks that British taxpayers' money would be a great deal better spent if the money were concentrated on law enforcement agencies in other EU countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many references to the important work of Europol. In case anyone tries to misinterpret what I am saying, I should stress that I do not mean that we should not have international co-operation. We certainly should. International co-operation, especially between police forces and other law enforcement agencies, is probably more important for tackling large-scale drug trafficking than for any other issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether much of the money and effort that goes through the EU on committees, working parties and the production of voluminous papers will be effective. From what the Minister said, Her Majesty's Government share some of my concerns. Given our position, I would be delighted if the Government could ensure less verbiage, less paper and proper action in future. My colleagues in the European Parliament—especially Tim Kirkhope, a distinguished holder of a former position as a Home Office Minister and now one of our spokesmen on justice and home affairs—and those from other UK parties do their best to bring some reality to the issue in their work there. I am sure that they will carry on doing so, especially those who have been Home Office Ministers, such as Tim Kirkhope, and can bring that knowledge of the internal workings of the system to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that we should concentrate on the important work that bodies such as this country's National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service and police do with their European counterparts. On my visits to other countries, I have seen the enormously important work of police co-operation. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and I went to the International Centre for Police Co-operation in the Hague. It is an extremely important body and does good work. I hope that the Minister will give the Government's endorsement of its work on drugs and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are mixed messages from different EU countries, as many hon. Members have suggested. It is unfortunate that many of the mixed messages that come from this country are the fault of Her Majesty's Government, some highly motivated arch-legalisers such as the hon. Member for Newport, West on the Government Back Benches, and many Liberal Democrats. They do enormous harm. It is my party's view that the Home Secretary has further muddied the waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way, as I want to develop my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary, the Minister and their colleagues continue to stand up in debates such as this and say, "Of course, we have not actually legalised cannabis." However, if one visits schools and talks to sixth formers, one discovers that almost every young person in this country—they see a limited amount of media—thinks that the Government have legalised cannabis. I challenge the Minister to go into any sixth form class in the country and persuade the students that the Government have not given them the signal that cannabis has been legalised. The Government have made a complete mess of the situation, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) has said. Logical positions could be taken in the approach to drugs, but the Home Secretary and the rest of the Government have taken none of them. They have muddied the waters and made the position worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, we agree with the Government on some points. We share a concern about the damage done by hard drugs. I was surprised and disappointed at the Minister's statement that he had had no signs of the work in Sweden, which we have seen and to which my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset referred in his speech at our party conference last week. There was a mixed message, however, in that the Minister went on to welcome my right hon. Friend's announcement that we wanted a huge expansion in the number of treatment places. The Minister must surely recognise that that is something that we learned from the success of the Swedish system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the European Scrutiny Committee were right to ask the questions that they asked, especially about the problem of hard drugs coming in through Turkey, and to challenge the Government over the way in which the debate has proceeded. I welcome the Minister's comment that firmer targets are needed, but I am concerned that the whole approach to the issue will not be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to focus on a specific issue. It is characteristic of areas on which there is no broad consensus on the most effective remedy that people develop hobbyhorses and become convinced that a particular scheme will solve the entire problem. I share that tendency to some extent. I am especially interested in the scheme referred to by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which was originally introduced in Switzerland and allows some legal supply of heroin to hard-core addicts through general practitioners. The scheme has been extremely effective in Switzerland in reducing both crime and addiction, but it was originally greeted with great hostility by the European Union, which objected to the fact that a country in the middle of western Europe was breaching the wall of complete rejection of legal use in any form. That view has changed over the years, and in Britain a large-scale pilot is being conducted for a similar scheme, which we all hope will succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly revisit the arguments for the scheme. When other approaches to solving addiction have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
failed and the addict is able to satisfy his or her addiction only by access to criminals, there is a double risk of increased criminality. First, the addict is supporting the criminal racket by buying drugs from criminals. Secondly, because of the expense involved, it is natural to discuss with the criminal ways in which he or she can obtain money to finance the habit. The criminal will suggest criminal ways of doing that, thereby increasing the overall level of criminality. In obtaining supplies from the general practitioner, the addict is taken out of the orbit of criminals and the market is destroyed, because he will not pay money to the criminal supplier for something that he can get free from the GP. In addition, because he is having a regular dialogue with his GP, it is possible to persuade the addict to consider alternative treatments and to work on him to come off the addiction gradually. The impact on burglary and other petty crime that is undertaken to raise the necessary cash is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point about the addict being brought into the ambit of the general practitioner in order to be weaned off the drugs was very similar to the argument put forward when the methadone programme was introduced big time seven or eight years ago. However, people who went on to methadone have stayed on it ever since—that has been its biggest failure. Therefore, I am not optimistic that we can translate the same hope on to heroin. It did not work with methadone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's point. It was a significant factor in the Swiss experience. The same problem had occurred there with methadone, but heroin has been different. The scheme has significantly reduced the level of addiction. Switzerland is a very conservative society, and there was a national referendum on the issue after the budget had been running for a couple of years. Perhaps to general surprise, the policy was confirmed by a substantial majority. When the population saw the results in reduced crime and addiction they became convinced that it was an experiment that ought to continue. I appreciate the reservation of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns), but although it is too early to tell whether it would work in Britain, it seems to have done so in Switzerland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it would be helpful if we encouraged our partners to join us in investigating the issue—some of them already have. I also draw the more general conclusion that in this area, in which it is notoriously difficult to make a breakthrough, we should be reasonably open minded about individual countries taking initiatives on a pilot scale to see whether they work. There is a need for experimentation at local level in order to determine the best approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, I do not feel strongly about the legalisation of cannabis. For all its virtues and drawbacks, cannabis does not appear to be the main driver of criminality, which is the issue that most concerns my constituents. On the whole, I would support my hon. Friend, but it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
is not something, as many colleagues on the Conservative Front Bench—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend had an opportunity to read the splendid polemic on drugs by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) in a book that he published some time ago. It had to be taken out of the book when he went on to the Front Bench, but if anyone wants to hear a marvellous argument for the decriminalisation of all drugs, they should read the hon. Gentleman's book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great admiration for the forensic skills of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton when he dissects Conservative policy on the issue. However, the problem is too serious for the sort of party political debate in which we have all been indulging. I do not want to detain the Committee longer than necessary. My point is simply that a degree of humility and open mindedness on the issue is important. We must recognise that no country in the world has really cracked the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow the hon. Member for Broxtowe and to echo the tone of his comments on the most important general point, which is that none of us are succeeding well enough to think that we have the answers. Different countries in Europe provide very different models, and we should allow that experimentation of national policy to flourish. I fully understand the Minister's point about the Netherlands. To put it bluntly, the failure of the Dutch system is that it is hypocritical. It suggests that the use of cannabis is permitted, but it has not decriminalised the supply chain between the supplier and the place where the ultimate user buys it, because it cannot do so. That is why I put the general point, which follows on from the point made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe, that it would be helpful if the EU negotiated in the United Nations for the narcotics convention to allow the EU as a whole, or individual member states of the EU if they so wish, to decriminalise some or all of the activities in relation to one or more drugs. That would not break the subsidiarity principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat party believes that we should decriminalise the growing personal use of cannabis and the supply of cannabis for personal use. That is not the most radical of proposals. We held back from talking about the general legalisation of drugs, in part because we are committed to the United Nations convention on narcotics, and no party can argue for a United Nations international agreement on one activity while opting out of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly urge Ministers to ask that the EU action plan should be able to allow member state Governments to take permissive decisions to decriminalise the possession and supply of cannabis for personal use. If the Netherlands and Portugal were being consistent with their declared current policy, they might wish to decriminalise the whole cannabis supply chain. That principle is central to the debate. It is much more honest and honourable than the difficult argument about administrative penalties and the pretence that it is an administrative matter, or the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
front door-back door inconsistency of the Dutch system. I understand that the Portuguese have gone the furthest down this road, but they are constrained because they are also signatories to the UN convention on narcotics. Most importantly, I seek to persuade the Minister to include that option in the EU drugs policy. Clearly, it would have to be negotiated internationally, and it would be better if it were negotiated on behalf of the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the motion, but its one weakness is that it removes the need for priority to be given to achievable time band targets. The motion also refers only to the fight against drug abuse and trafficking. It would have been better if it referred to the reduction of harm and other issues that we have discussed such as education, which are central. As the Minister said, young people are not stupid. A well-educated cohort of young people throughout Europe who understand the difference in consequence, according to all the evidence, between use of cannabis, Ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and crack cocaine is one of the best protections for the future. People at least then make informed choices and are much more likely to be honest about where they go to seek treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that colleagues may wish to contribute, but I have several more points. First, it is important to have regular debates such as this on EU policy as a whole and, more properly, on the comparisons between what happens in different parts of the EU. It is therefore also important that, in future, the powers that be, whoever they are, ensure that if a document is deposited in Parliament in July 2001, we consider it in 2001, not 2002 or 2003. I hope that we can remedy that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would elaborate on what is happening on UK Government drugs policy. He rightly said that there had been no policy change since 1998. We used to have the annual report and national plan—indeed, I have the first three here—but I think that that series stopped being produced, and we await an announcement on the Government's new drugs strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Government would seek to obtain maximum agreement among the parties before the strategy is finalised. That might seem unlikely in one sense, because of our apparently very different views. With the intention declared by the Home Secretary, the Government have moved towards a more realistic view on cannabis. The Liberal Democrats have moved much more clearly towards the position that possessing cannabis for personal use should not be criminal and that people should not be prosecuted for that anywhere. Action should not be taken in just one part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party appears to be saying that the most important thing should be intervention to prevent addiction from growing among the young, and treating the young. I do not criticise the Conservatives for saying that. We can argue about whether their suggested model is the best one, but there is scope for agreement on harm minimisation, treatment and intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
There is a pilot scheme to get heroin users and addicts out of the hands of criminals and into a safer place. That is entirely desirable, although I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde that there is differing evidence about what is effective at getting people off an addiction. Merely substituting methadone for heroin does not necessarily get someone back into a drug-free lifestyle, but existing evidence needs to be tested on such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are the EU's worst performing country in regard to drug addiction, and the situation has been relatively better in England and Wales than in Scotland and Northern Ireland. There, drug use has increased considerably, whereas in England and Wales it has gone in different directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like every other Member of the House, the salient issues for me are those that most affect the communities in which I live and the constituents whom I represent, such as the tragedy of people whose son, daughter, daughter-in-law, girlfriend or boyfriend has become addicted. Nothing was more painful than when a 26-year-old girl, whose family I have known for years, came to my door absolutely riddled with drugs and asking for help. She was going into prostitution to get the money. That was the pathetic result of a family tragedy: her father died and she went completely off the rails. I see her hanging around, but giving her money is not the answer. We are all aware of such tragedies. They are real and often lead to fatalities, and we must be much more effective in dealing with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is the serious drug use that leads to crime. It is evident from Government figures and all the evidence that it is not the use of cannabis or Ecstasy that leads to criminality, but the use of heroin and crack cocaine. Separating the users from the suppliers gets the users out of the hands of criminals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke at length to the previous borough commander in Lambeth, Brian Paddick, and to the present borough commander, Brian Moore. They are different characters with an entirely different approach, but both told me that the hype about Lambeth becoming a new drugs haven is nonsense. My colleague, friend and neighbour, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) is party to that misrepresentation of what has been happening. The person who piloted the scheme and the person who probably would never have done so tell me that things are no worse. They both accept that the system is much more successful if it targets the dealers and heavy drug users. They both tried to do that and reckon that they have had success in that respect, and it has been hysterical hype to suggest that the policy has produced a sudden new emporium for people from all over London or elsewhere. I hope that we can be honest and will listen to those who have the facts and not give in to a public misperception, fuelled by the media, who want to misrepresent bold initiatives as being unsuccessful when they have been extremely successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said one thing with which I passionately disagree: that it is only hard drug use, not the use of soft drugs, that is connected with other crime. I ask him, in all seriousness, if he has

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
come across anyone who is addicted to heroin or cocaine whose first contact with the drugs industry was not through cannabis? It is the pathway to hard drug addiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's direct question is yes, I have. Cannabis is sometimes the pathway because the person who supplies the cannabis, to whom people go for drugs, then tries to sell them the harder drug. As many of the hon. Gentleman's Conservative colleagues and some of the traditionally Conservative press, such as 	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> have said, the logical answer is to separate the places where people go to get cannabis from those supplying hard drugs. It is obvious market economics. Drug dealers who supply people with relatively harmless, cheap drugs will try to sell them a bigger and better product. It is no different whatever is being sold: whether it is drugs, Belgian chocolates or white goods such as washing machines, it is the same principle. Sellers want people to buy more of what they are supplying and to become more dependent on their supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath and his party are fundamentally wrong to believe that if we took out cannabis, which is used by 44 per cent. of the country, which people do not regard as dangerous and which is, on all the evidence, much less dangerous than other drugs, it would increase progress into harder drugs. The evidence in the European monitoring centre's report and that of the EU drugs policy is clear: it found a strong association between problematical drug use such as heroin and/or crack addiction and criminality. Most offenders were more likely than the rest of the population to be consumers of prohibited drugs. The reality is that car nicking and house breaking are fuelled by people who are paying for hard drugs. By and large, people do not go burgling to get the money for a bit of cannabis at the weekend. In my constituency, people who use Ecstasy are not known as those who cause the most trouble. I am sorry to say that I have known many people who have used Ecstasy, but they are not the people whom the police are after for serious drug use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important—it comes back to where I began— to have good European co-ordination in dealing with the demand and supply of illicit drugs. It is important, too, to understand what the facts and figures show, however uncomfortable that message may be. The level of hard drug use is unacceptably high across the EU and especially in the United Kingdom. Sadly, we are still one of the worst performers. It is therefore vital that we get accurate monitoring. Targets may not be wise because they sometimes have to be dropped, but it would be good to know exactly what is going on and to have clear comparisons so that we could learn from that rich experience. The Swedes may be very successful. If so, we need to learn that. That argument is not generally accepted. It is early days for the Portuguese, but they appear to be relatively successful. The Dutch may be about to change policy, depending on which Government are in office after the next general election in the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Diverse solutions should be pursued across the EU. I hope that we can break out of the straitjacket of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
international constraints that prevent us from being bold and imaginative. We have to win the argument at home, but the more diversity of approach there is across the EU and the more accurate information there is, the better. We have to police external boundaries and reduce the supply, but supply cannot be reduced until demand is reduced. Demand is not reduced if the link between supply and demand is criminals who are making money out of it. I hope that, under its new enlightened home affairs leadership, the Conservative party will not fall for the old solutions. Many other Conservatives, including those in the press, have understood that they have not worked and that we need to move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.26 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the tone of the debate. The word "humility" has been used. It is an appropriate stance against the massive failure on our continent. Every year, 30,000 people die from illegal drug misuse. There is also misuse of legal or medicinal drugs. There is a huge problem and we are only just looking at how to assess it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drug laws have changed on two occasions. There were big changes in the 1920s. Almost all European countries changed their policies after the right-wing Government in America introduced prohibition of drugs and alcohol. We did not follow them down that route, but we prohibited certain drugs. It was quite irrational. They were not dangerous or addictive. It is interesting that cannabis was never used recreationally in Britain until it was prohibited. The prohibition of illegal drugs did not eliminate their use; it increased it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next great change took place in 1961 with the single convention on narcotic drugs. The United Nations believed, quite seriously and for good reasons, that it would eliminate drug use in the world. It did not. Do we have any solutions? We do not as such but we know that some policies will reduce harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1971, we changed our policies in response to the single convention and the result is alarming. Before 1971 there were fewer than 1,000 heroin and cocaine addicts in Britain. According to Home Office figures there are now about 280,000. The drug laws are not working. Before 1971, people who were using heroin could get supplies from the national health service. One of them was the author of "National Velvet", a very dignified lady living in a leafy English village. She took massive quantities of heroin because she became addicted when given morphine during an operation. She took those huge quantities every day of her adult life. She died serenely and peacefully in her bed at the age of 91.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrast that with what happened two years ago when one batch of heroin killed 50 young people in Ireland and Scotland. They were not killed by heroin. If it had been clean and taken under hygienic conditions and they had known its strength, they would not have been affected. They were killed by prohibition. They were killed because we have introduced a law that means that the supply, manufacture and distribution of the drug are in the hands of irresponsible criminals. That batch of heroin

was contaminated. That is what we must look at now, rather than the waffle in these documents, which are a disgrace. They could be talking about a different continent. Nothing in them informs us about the ferment of trial, experiment and debate currently taking place in every part of Europe. They are little more than a wish list of expectations and might-have-beens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on the Government's change of policy direction since last year. I refer him to my splendid website, which analyses Government policy in 1998 in comparison with their most recent policy. Viewers are invited to spot the difference. The proposals before us show that the Government are seeking achievable aims, which is something new. Tragedies increased every year. We never opted for achievable aims, which poses the question of what aims are unachievable. Rather than avoid taking hard decisions or challenging editors of the 	<i>Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph</i> and the 	<i>Evening Standard</i>—people who treacherously ask the Government to change policy and then attack them for doing so—we should examine outcomes and understand what really happens in the drugs world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention drug education because it is a convenient way of dealing with the problem of not knowing what to do about drugs. Governments have simply thrown some money into drug education, but that is inadequate. Let me tell a story to illustrate what I mean. I once visited Holland with a woman who was responsible for giving drug education lessons in schools. She explained to the Dutch audience that the effect of cannabis was to make women promiscuous and men impotent—about as unsatisfactory a position as could be imagined. It was gratifying to note how many of the Dutch males present were willing to give their time and energy to prove to that lady that the effect of cannabis on males was not as she believed. The truth is that we have talked nonsense to our children about the dangers of many drugs. It reminds me of what I was taught at school many years ago—that certain sexual practices would make us go blind. No scientific basis has ever been provided for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DART and DARE trials in America are another example. A device was produced and every time it was condemned as useless and a waste of money, the vast prohibition industry in America said that what was taught five years ago was not as good as it should have been but that the new practice was fine. That has happened four times over the past 25 years. There is no way of getting through to young people on the basis of information that they later find to be false. That will not persuade them not to do what their peers are doing. That will not counter peer pressure. We should reflect on examples of drug laws working and reducing drug harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all received terrible phone calls from constituents, often from mothers. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, we might hear that their daughters are in prostitution, their sons suicidal. When tragedy results, what can we say to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
those mothers? One told me that she was buying heroin for her son. She wanted a clean supply and knew where to get it in the right strengths. I told her that what she had done was the act of a loving parent. She was keeping her son away from the illegal drug trade, which might well have resulted in his death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other parents on a Radio 2 programme said that a mother had instructed her son to commit a crime because it was the only way in which he could get treatment. The mother said that she did not want to see her son dead. If he committed a crime, he could go to prison where treatment was available. Unfortunately, despite the posturing by a series of Governments, we failed—until last year—to deal effectively with such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attended debates in this House since 1987. Whenever drugs were discussed, a similar pattern was discernible. The Government and Opposition agreed that new schemes were necessary and that more money should be spent here and there, yet hanging over the Chamber every year were statistics that condemned us: more people were buying and using drugs, leading to more drug crime and more people's lives wasted. It is not insignificant that our country has the harshest drug laws in Europe and the worst outcomes. A report produced for the 43 countries of the Council of Europe examined outcomes effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with what is said in the document: we need the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which does a splendid job in making a reasonable comparison between countries. As a rapporteur for the Council of Europe's social, health and family affairs committee, I had the task of preparing a report on that, which happily was accepted unanimously by the 63 members of that committee, representing 43 countries. It is an enormously difficult task to look objectively at what works and what does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most members of the Committee accept that existing drug policy is not obviously successful, to put it mildly. Does my hon. Friend accept that the policy of drug legalisation also has its difficulties? To be honest, I have not smoked cannabis, but if it were legal, I would be curious enough to give it a try. I am sure there are many people in that situation. There is a risk that legalisation would expand the market, perhaps expand addiction, and then—even though the supply was legal—drive people into committing crime to support their legal addiction. There are problems both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not have to look at the theory. We can look at what has happened. The countries that I examined in detail were the two most pragmatic countries in Europe, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and the two most prohibitive, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The results were fascinating. Taking the figures from Sweden and the United Kingdom, and using 1986 as a base year, the only two countries that doubled their drug harm in that period were Sweden and the UK. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath shakes his head—I hope to hear his figures that contradict that. The matter has been before the Council of Europe for 18 months, and no one has contradicted those figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have in front of me the European Parliament's research—the working paper on the drug policies of the Netherlands and Sweden and how they compare. May I suggest that the hon. Gentleman ought to rely on that rather than dangerous nonsense? When he suggests that cannabis medically does no harm, I hold him personally responsible for peddling dangerous nonsense, and he should be ashamed of himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fatuous intervention, and I am sorry the hon. Gentleman made it. I have never at any time suggested that any drug does no harm. I have been a lifelong campaigner against all drugs. If he looks at the document, he will find that there is a low level of drug use in Sweden, but it is increasing at a faster rate than it is elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most striking thing is that 25 years after there was regulated decriminalisation of part of the trade in the Netherlands, the use of soft and hard drugs there is less than it is here in all grades, and the number of deaths is far fewer than it is here, after we have had 30 years of the harshest prohibition in Europe. The evidence is there. I believe that that situation is reversible, despite the electoral aberration that that country suffered recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a significant matter that Sweden can celebrate. The greatest example in Europe of a success in relation to drug harm is in Sweden. An average number of women there use nicotine. Sweden's drug deaths from nicotine among women exactly match the European average, but deaths among males are half the European average. The reason for that, which is significant, is that half the males use nicotine without smoking. They use it in the form of snus, a drug that is illegal, incredibly, in this country. However, in Sweden, it has cut the number of male deaths from cancer by half. That is because nicotine in itself is not a harmful drug. It is no more harmful than caffeine, but if one wraps it up, sets fire to it and smokes it, one inhales 400 chemicals, 60 of which are carcinogenic. If one ingests it in other ways, it is a relatively harmless drug. We banned the use of that oral form of nicotine in this country because we thought that it would lead to oral cancers and it does not; it does so very rarely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that we are in denial of the truth: when we see an example of harm reduction that works successfully, we tend to deny it. As politicians, we fall back on the easy line, and say that we are going to be tough on drugs. All Governments over 30 years have said that, but none have claimed to be intelligent on drugs or courageous on drugs until the past 12 months, during which we have seen the Home Secretary's actions. They are the first steps. Many people believe that cannabis is now decriminalised. In many cases it is, de facto, decriminalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear about one of the least progressive police forces in the country, which was the last to investigate cases and to imprison two men for using cannabis medicinally. In the past month, it took up a case of a man who was clearly guilty of breaking the law because he was using cannabis to help his serious illness. Magistrates refused to convict the man although he had definitely broken the law. In other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
parts of the country, juries are refusing to convict. Politicians should examine what has happened. Public opinion has overtaken us and we will see that the police, magistrates and the community in general will refuse to obey a foolish law. It is up to us to catch up with public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Holland's greatest success, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggested, has been a lower use of cannabis than in this country. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe said that it might be a bigger attraction if it were legal. I would not smoke it whether it were legal or not—I would not smoke anything. Holland has removed the attraction of the forbidden fruit. In this country, young people think that cannabis is fascinating, wicked and dangerous, which is what they want because they all know that they are immortal and will live for ever. However, those arguments would not work if people could use cannabis in a cake and go to take it in a cafe with their grandmother. Where is the fun in that? It takes away part of the appeal. The best thing that we can do is to persuade young people not to smoke cannabis, which would give an immediate health gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Netherlands, the two markets have been separated. A break away from one drug to another is more likely to happen in Britain than elsewhere in Europe because the marketing, sale and pushing of heroin, cannabis and cocaine are in the hands of the same people, which allows users to progress easily from one to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the first time for a long time, the hon. Gentleman has said something with which I agree. He said that part of the attraction for young people is the danger of doing something illegal. I agree with him 100 per cent. If cannabis were legalised, the first illegal drugs with the attraction of danger would be the hard drugs—the most addictive drugs and the drugs that kill. Does the hon. Gentleman not see that the logic of his argument is one of the strongest reasons why cannabis should not be legalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should go back to the position in Britain before 1971. Cannabis was illegal then but the attraction was not there. We have given an incentive to the black market, which does not pay taxes and is irresponsible and indifferent to its customers' health. The market has grown fat and rich under the rules of prohibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a practical example from the Netherlands. Cannabis is usually used responsibly there: people use it at the weekends and do not drive after using it. It has become one of the recreational drugs. We should consider the really harmful drugs—alcohol and tobacco—that are not mentioned in the document, and the great scourge that they are to lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest example of drug abuse that wrecks people's lives in Britain is probably the use of neuroleptic drugs in prisons and residential homes for adults. Those drugs are used in prisons to keep prisoners, especially female prisoners, quiet. A book called "Darkness Visible" shows how young female prisoners are given neuroleptic drugs if they mutilate themselves. The drugs make them wander around in strange ways as though they are muppets, to use the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
prison slang. The routine use of such drugs as a chemical cosh in residential homes for the elderly to turn lively argumentative older people into zombies is an awful sight and a continuing disgrace. Although we rightly worry about deaths from Ecstasy—they used to run at approximately 12 a year but have increased to a couple of dozen a year—those figures are dwarfed by the enormous number of deaths from the simple, respectable drugs that can be found in people's medicine cabinets—antidepressants and painkillers. One brand of painkiller killed 600 people last year and antidepressants regularly kill 500 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When examining the harm done by drugs, we should look critically at any failures created by politicians over the years. The massive loss of life and huge amount of crime caused by drugs are entirely unnecessary. The problem is not the drugs themselves but the drug laws: they are not working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal with comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West? I also welcome the tone of the debate. He and I may disagree on aspects of this issue, but we have had several debates on drugs over the past year and we are now able—I hope that we never return to anything less—to discuss the issues openly, sensibly and calmly. I welcome that change. We must continue to analyse what is a real problem and deal with it as best we can. We will always have differences of opinion, but they should be discussed in the tone in which we have conducted our debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the most passionate arguments advanced by my hon. Friend about the problems that we confront are not necessarily arguments for legalisation. They are powerful arguments for growth in the capacity for treatment, which should be a priority. It has been the Government's priority for some time and I am glad to see that it is also the priority of a leading member of the Conservative Opposition, even if that change of tone, style and priority has not reached every part of the Opposition Front-Bench team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the record straight with regard to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, cannabis has not and will not be decriminalised. He asked about the medicinal use of cannabis. We are trying to deal with that issue as quickly as we possibly can. Studies evaluating the medicinal use of cannabis derivatives are under way with a view to making drugs available as soon as that evaluation has been completed, if it is justified. He said that he knew of cases in which magistrates have refused to take action, but, equally, we can cite cases in which magistrates have taken strong action—against those running cannabis cafes in Stockport recently, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody should be under the illusion that cannabis has been legalised or decriminalised, or we will get people into serious trouble. It is an illegal substance. It is illegal to traffic in it and will remain so. People will be prosecuted if they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe mentioned the need for heroin prescription and the experimentation in Switzerland. He knows about the matter because he examines such issues in detail. Heroin prescription is not illegal in Britain but, in all probability, heroin is under-valued as a prescribed drug. The Home Affairs Committee exposed that issue, as he knows. The main problem is not the legal framework but the confidence of the medical practitioners. We aim to increase confidence by agreeing new guidelines with medical practitioners to enable them to feel comfortable about prescribing diamorphine as an alternative to methadone in appropriate circumstances. We are not opposed to heroin prescription: it has its place within a range of treatments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked me what went on yesterday and I said that I did not know. What I think happened is that there was continued discussion on minimum and maximum penalties, and we came fairly close to reaching an agreement on that. There was some quite positive feedback from yesterday's meeting. However, the main country that had a problem on that matter was the Netherlands, and it does not now have a Government—as the hon. Gentleman will know from the contents of this morning's papers—so there will be a delay before there is a definitive decision on the matter. However, I think that there was a degree of positive movement with regard to reaching an agreement on minimum and maximum penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely comfortable with that. Does the Minister accept that, although that is a good thing, it would not be a good thing if there were a mandatory penalty, either across the EU or in this country, for a particular offence, because it should always be for the courts in any member state to decide the appropriate penalty, within the bounds of the minimum and maximum penalties that the Minister was talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The courts always have discretion within legal systems, but there is a great gain to be made—particularly with regard to small-scale trafficking, supply and use—in agreeing what the minimums and maximums ought to be. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, and that is what we have been working very hard to achieve since the Prime Minister's initiative two or three years ago. I hope that we are now getting close to an agreement, although I do not know whether we will achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to say more about our policy review, and to seek cross-party support for it. Much of the emphasis of the review is already in the public domain—indeed, it seems to be on the website of the hon. Member for Newport, West. It is in the public domain because of the responses that we made to the Select Committee on Home Affairs. Focus will be placed on harm minimisation and on dealing with problematic drug users, and there will be an ongoing commitment to increase treatment capacity, but there will also be continued tough measures against the trafficking and supply of illegal drugs, focusing mainly on the class A drugs—heroin and crack cocaine—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey agrees with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say any more. I am not going to put our position into the public domain ahead of an announcement on the review. I am more than happy to consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there should be some cross-party discussion. However, people have to make up their minds and then make announcements. Therefore, I am unsure whether anything can be gained from such a discussion. I am not against it in principle, as we should seek maximum agreement on this subject, but I do not know whether it can be done in this circumstance, because many of our ideas and intentions are already in the public domain. However, I will reconsider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, and if there is some mileage in it I will come back to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that although he intends to support the motion, he is slightly worried about it because it does not emphasise harm minimisation. Although it does not do that, it is not intended to detract in any way from that. It does not emphasise that because we have got a little further at the European level on harm minimisation on the demand reduction side. I refer him to paragraph 2.1.1 of the action plan, which states that the five key epidemiological indicators have now been agreed:
	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>"extent and pattern of drug use in the general population</li>
	<li>prevalence of problem drug use</li>
	<li>demand for treatment by drug users</li>
	<li>drug-related deaths and mortality of drug users</li>
	<li>drug-related infectious diseases (HIV, hepatitis B&C"</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Therefore, we have made more progress on that side, but we need to make progress on the other side, although harm minimisation is extremely important, and it is a road down which we should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about Lambeth and cannabis reclassification issues, as did several other hon. Members. I broadly agree with what he said. There was a lot of hype around Lambeth, and I have to say that the Conservatives were heavily involved in that, as were sections of the press. Is it not incredible that, after all their opportunist interventions on the reclassification of cannabis, not a single word was said about their own policy on that during the heralded speech of the right hon. Member for West Dorset at his party's recent conference? It would be interesting to know what their policy is. They created mischief by questioning whether there had been mixed messages on cannabis, but they cannot say whether they would reverse the policy. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if can tell us now, but he probably has a different opinion from his boss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my fear that the splendid speech made by the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any Conservative Member will stand up and defend the right hon. Gentleman all that strongly this morning.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has certainly not intervened to tell us what his party's policy is on the reclassification of cannabis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now going to tell us his party's policy on reclassification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can have his fun, but I made it clear in my earlier remarks that I did not understand his initial remark that there was nothing new in the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. I fully support what my right hon. Friend said. He and my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) made clear our position on the Lambeth experiment at the time, and that has not changed. In relation to all drugs issues, any policies that we introduce when we return to Government will be evidence based, unlike the prejudice and nonsense of the hon. Member for Newport, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's intervention, and I noticed that there was no answer to the question about his party's policy on cannabis reclassification. It was carefully disguised, and the hon. Gentleman should be congratulated on that, but he clearly did not answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's endorsement of what he and his colleagues have clearly been briefed is the position on Lambeth, because I have been given the same information. It would be helpful if the main Opposition talked to the people who know the facts and reported back honestly on what they were told. It helps none of us if there is a distortion of the evidence that the Government and my party have been given. Members of the Conservative party would find the same evidence as us if they were to speak to the borough commander in Lambeth or his predecessor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Gentleman, I have spoken to commanders Paddick and Moore, and I have received exactly the same feedback as he has. I also received that feedback from senior members of the Metropolitan police. It is unfortunate that Lambeth was put under the spotlight, but positive things have come out of that too. An increased effort has been made for joined-up co-operation at a local level, and the Home Office, the police standards unit, the Metropolitan police and the Association of Police Authorities have all given their assistance. Great rewards have been reaped from the clampdown on the peddling of hard drugs in the Brixton area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interventions of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath have been different in tone from other comments made from the Opposition Front Bench. He talks about gobbledygook and the need for law enforcement, as if that were the only thing that was needed, whereas the right hon. Member for West Dorset in his recent speech emphasised the need for treatment. I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that his views on Europe are well known. The issues and the documents are complicated, and it is difficult to do justice to them, but I do not know how we put in place a framework that gives us transferable information on every aspect of the drug problem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
without ending up with such complex documents. We need to have some input into the process and to pin the problem down. We must distil our information about the problem into priorities that can be pursued and targets that make us accountable, no matter how uncomfortable we may feel in trying to meet them. Those aims were never close to being met by the empty chair policies that were in place when the Conservatives were in power. If we want those clear objectives and priorities to be put in place, we must get involved and ensure that the right policies are adopted. We are trying to ensure that the action plan delivers some benefit additional to that which can be delivered nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely share the Minister's view on that, but he neglected my central point. I asked him whether he would consider including in the EU action plan a provision to the effect that the EU should approach the UN with a view to permitting member states to pursue alternative strategies if they so wish, which would allow a diversity of approach. I understand that he will have to speak to his colleagues about that, but will he give the Committee an assurance that he will consider it? It seems wise to benefit from different experiences in the EU, but to let different countries do different things if they want to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all sure that we can stop them.

hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but I shall think about what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider such a document, we know that there will be a more general debate on drugs, not just a debate on the documentation before the Committee— rightly so, because the issue concerns us all. I reiterate, however, that the drugs strategy should be given time to work. Many policies have been put in place and substantial resources have been made available. I shall not exaggerate their effectiveness or say that we have found the solutions that will deliver immediate substantial change, but those policies must be given a chance to have an impact. One idea that has not been mentioned is asset recovery, and we have been singularly ineffective in this country in taking the profit out of crime, yet profit is the motive behind organised crime, which is supported by drug trafficking to a great extent. Effective legislation, used systematically by the courts, could have a substantial impact, reducing trafficking in this country. Hopefully, such legislation will bear some fruit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
