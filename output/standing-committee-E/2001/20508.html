	<p>[	<i>Relevant document: European Union document No. 11932/01, Commission White Paper: European Transport Policy for 2010: "Time to decide".</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions Mr. David Jamieson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara? You and I have shared many happy hours in Committee Rooms over the past decade, but this is the first time that we have shared a Room with you in the Chair, and I am pleased to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee recently debated the Commission's broad policy framework for transport set out in last year's White Paper, which established the context for the proposals for the rail sector. However, I welcome the opportunity to debate them further. The Government share the Commission's objective of seeking to enhance the role of the railways in our transport system through the promotion of greater efficiency and higher quality services. Those proposals build on measures previously agreed by the Council and the European Parliament to open the railways to greater competition, underpinned by technical measures to ensure fair and effective rights of access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council's consideration is still at an early stage, and we want to take account of the opinions of interested parties before we finalise our views. We can welcome much in the package, however. In particular, we support the proposal to complete rail freight liberalisation. Since the rail freight market in Great Britain was liberalised, we have experienced strong growth—among the highest in the European Union. The proposals would provide welcome additional pressure for a more commercial approach by incumbent rail freight operators on the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package contains important proposals on safety regulation, interoperability and the establishment of a European Railway Agency. The objectives of the proposals—ensuring that safety is regulated transparently and fairly, and that enhanced rights of access to the whole EU rail network are not frustrated by technical barriers—are entirely sound. However, we start from a position of disparate national systems. Harmonisation of standards and methods could impose significant costs, as well as
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
delivering benefits. Also, we should recall that the industry is heavily subsidised by Europe's taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport Sub-Committee's recent report on the European transport White Paper criticised the Commission's failure to assess the costs of its proposals. We share those concerns. We shall press for a fuller explanation of the costs and benefits of the technical proposals for the rail sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package also suggests that the Community accede to the convention concerning international carriage by rail—the COTIF convention. That rational and welcome proposal reflects the reality of where competence on some matters addressed in the new COTIF convention lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's communication also indicates its intention to make further proposals to enhance the quality of freight and passenger rail services in the next three years. We shall engage constructively with the Commission as it develops its ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those remarks are a helpful introduction to the debate, and I look forward to responding to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister, which should be asked briefly and one at a time. Each member of the Committee is likely to have ample opportunity to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, although I think that this is the third occasion on which I have served under your chairmanship. It is always a pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister a general question, of which I gave him notice before the Committee began, about how the documents fit in with the Cullen report and the role of the Health and Safety Executive. The Minister knows what I want, and I am sure that he will oblige.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of his question, which raises a point that is key to our consideration of the documents. As he knows, the Cullen report proposed that there should be an independent body to investigate rail accidents—that is, independent of the rail industry and the safety regulator. I think that it was to be called the rail accident investigation branch, which would be akin to the marine accident investigation branch and the air accidents investigation branch, which have proved to be very good at conducting independent investigations. We welcome that proposal in the Cullen report, as it fits in with Government thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cullen report also proposed that there should be a rail industry safety body. The current equivalent is called Railway Safety, a company in the Railtrack group. We do not want to stand in the way of the creation of a new rail industry safety body, but there would be differences in its relationship with the HSE. At the moment, the HSE approves safety cases that come before it and it can make objections, but in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
future, each train operating company would have to seek authorisation from the HSE to go ahead with safety cases. The rail industry safety body would then have a different relationship with the HSE. The documents contain many safety proposals that chime well with the Cullen proposals, and which we broadly welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is again a pleasure to see you in charge of us, Mr. O'Hara, in this Committee which now seems to sit almost every week, but not always under your great guidance. I cannot recall whether you are a member of the all-party railways group, which I chair, but I think that everyone in Europe would say amen to the theory of free movement of goods and people on the railways. The current problems of access for freight from this country to the continent and vice versa are a chronic impediment to that, especially considering the ongoing problems at Sangatte and the difficulties with the French Republic's adherence to the principles that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is probably aware that the freight company English, Welsh & Scottish Railway has lodged a complaint with the Commission. Will he give the Committee an update on what his Department is doing to support that complaint, and does he have any information about the position taken by the Foreign Office in representations to the French Republic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for raising that important point. The problem frustrates freight operating companies, and we, too, are deeply frustrated by our apparent limited ability to affect events there. There has been some reduction in the number of clandestines coming to the United Kingdom in recent months, but large numbers are still entering by train. Some are getting on trains some distance from France, and others may even be boarding in Italy and countries a considerable distance from the channel tunnel. We continue to make representations to the French Government, and we shall immediately seek discussions with the new French Transport Minister, once that person has been identified and taken office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe will meet the French ambassador today to update him on the ongoing situation. The matter causes great frustration to us, and we are dealing with it daily. We want the companies that are suffering financial loss and loss of business to take up the measures available to them through the Commission and to seek redress through legal means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend for his question. I dare say that there is no simple and easy short-term solution, but I assure him that we are doing everything we can to deal with this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to the advanced version of the train protection system. I understand that European ideas
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
for the system that would operate on the trans-European rail network are not entirely compatible with proposals in this country. Will he elaborate on what progress has been made on plans for integration with the European proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that Cullen recommended fitting a system, and that recommendation will probably be implemented by the end of next year. The Health and Safety Commission has since received recommendations on the European rail traffic management system, and it is up to the commission to consider those, although it received them only on 25 April. It must then make recommendations to the Secretary of State, and we shall act on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider several issues, however, including the safety case and the value of any proposal, which means that there must be a cost-benefit analysis. Like all other member states, we must also consider what systems and lines any proposals fit with to see whether they chime with the idea of interoperability across the European Union. We are therefore at an early stage, but we must be mindful of the fact that this country's actions should make it possible for freight to move in the way that we want and for a free and liberal market to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying message in the hon. Gentleman's question is the possibility of incompatible systems, of which we shall obviously be mindful. As the directives go through the relevant processes, we shall deal with the issues that I outlined, both in the European context and internally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Rail Agency seems to be an excellent proposition. Is it, like the Strategic Rail Authority, intended to provide a strategic plan? If so, what will be its relationship with the SRA? Will it have teeth and produce lines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the situation is not quite what my hon. Friend suggests. The ERA will be a technical, advisory body to the Commission. It will contain people from the industry, and will be a fountain of good technical expertise. Any advice that it gives will go through the Commission, and it will not have a direct relationship with bodies in this country. Indeed, those bodies will have a high degree of subsidiarity when carrying out their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the establishment of the ERA. We would like one or two things to be changed, although those will be negotiated with time. Generally, however, we welcome the idea because of the great potential for savings in the context of interoperability through, for example, joint technical standards and the common production of rolling stock. Some economies of scale that may flow from the ERA and the interoperability directive could be considered an advantage. However, I am mindful that we could also incur considerable costs, so we must weigh matters carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to the safety White Paper, which implies that witnesses who give evidence in railway accident investigations should be given immunity. Does he support that recommendation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that that is right. It is the practice of other investigation bodies. The investigation would be separate from any prosecution that took place. We want people to feel that they can speak freely when they give evidence to the investigation body. If they do not have that feeling, a proper investigation cannot take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any exceptions to rail freight liberalisation? I am thinking particularly of the spent nuclear waste freight that has blighted my constituency for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister back to his first answer on how these matters tie in with the Cullen report and, in particular, the proposal to set up an independent rail accident investigation body. Some time has passed since the Cullen report, so will the Minister say when such a body will be established?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because this European package is before us, we must work with it. Doing anything separately and independently at the moment would be ill advised. The measures identified here will be rolled out in the next few years, depending on the progress that they make in the European Union. Our ambition is to have the body in place as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be too technical, but I was a chartered civil engineer before entering Parliament and I worked in railways for most of my life, so I shall take the Minister gently through my question. The aim of the documents is interoperability and the biggest impediment to that in this country, compared with the rest of Europe, is non-compliance with the Berne gauge, which concerns the clearance distance from structures such as tunnel walls, bridges and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an SRA proposal to consider a new-build railway through the centre of Britain. Will the Minister say whether that new infrastructure would have to be interoperable, and would therefore have to be built to the Berne gauge? What would be the consequences for operations in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for not being too technical. People imagine that the problem of gauge involves the line itself, but of course the size of bridges and tunnels inhibits the free flow of trains throughout the European network. If a new scheme were being considered—either a substantial upgrade of an existing line or a totally new one—it would have to be interoperable with the freight services across Europe. It would be against the interests of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
promoting such a line to construct one that was not interoperable with the rest of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no intention to make some smaller schemes interoperable, and there would probably be no economic benefit in doing so in the case of a small branch line that needed improvements made to itself or its bridges. In certain cases, we may request derogation, so we may not have to apply the interoperability rules. It would be extraordinary if a major construction was not interoperable, but that would depend on the scheme itself and the uses that the persons promoting it had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister a chance to clarify a point he made to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)? The Minister said that the Cullen recommendation on train protection would be in force in a little while. A rather primitive train protection system will be in operation, but I remind him that Lord Cullen recommended that we go for the European rail traffic management system. He recommended level 1, but the Commission for Integrated Transport and the SRA suggest that that should be abandoned and that we should move towards level 2. However, that would not come about until 2017. Given that the ERTMS is conditional on receiving aid from the European Union, will he clearly state the Government's position on advanced train protection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is as I set it out to the hon. Member for Ludlow—a recommendation has been made to the HSC. The Government also have the documents before the Committee. I dare say that, in a short time, the commission will make recommendations to the Secretary of State. We shall make our decision in the context of the documents before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improving and maintaining safety is an absolute priority, but we must do that cost-effectively. We must consider the economics to ensure that we do not place too great a burden on the industry, because it is perfectly possible that putting safety systems in place on the rail system could impose such a burden that freight may be driven back on to the roads. That could be even more dangerous and cause more casualties, so we must weigh the matter carefully, both generally and in terms of the whole European package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper's objectives are clearly credible, in so far as the purpose is to move traffic from road to rail—the Government are leading on that. I suggest to the Minister that the most obvious place to put that into practice is the south coast, where we have no option but to look to rail because further use of the road network is impossible for environmental reasons. The map on page 35 of the White Paper seems to show no strategic links across the south of Britain. Should that problem be considered in a European dimension, or is it wholly a matter for the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We very much welcome the move within the European package to get traffic from road to rail. My hon. Friend is probably aware that we lead in Europe in the grants that we have given to facilitate both that and, on occasion, transportation on water, either by sea or inland waterway. We still have responsibility for the internal network, but any decisions that we take would more sensibly be made in the context of the European package. However, if I understand him correctly, it will be for the United Kingdom and our industry to make decisions, and recommendations may be made to the SRA. That will be very much a matter for the United Kingdom, just as it will be for other member states to develop their rail systems as appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return once again to the introduction of TPS by the end of 2003. What advice have the Government received about whether it will lead to lower rail capacity and whether it could push more people on to the roads, thereby increasing road accident rates, which could lead to a higher overall death rate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I alluded to that a moment ago. I do not think that we expect that from the TPWS—the train protection and warning system. If we went for the whole European rail traffic management system package, we would certainly have that capacity, mainly for economic reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our network is different from those of other European countries, because it is highly concentrated. The west coast and east coast main lines in particular are highly complex, with freight, local and inter-city trains all running on the same tracks. As soon as we upgraded one part of the line, we would have to upgrade all the trains in the system, the cost of which could be enormous. As I said to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), if we went to extremes with the upgrading, traffic could be pushed on to the roads for economic reasons, which would cause greater casualty rates. Therefore, we must weigh those matters carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the Minister's comments about the complexities of operational railways, especially in the south-east, where three or four different types of railway are operating at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me on to my question, which relates to the application of development and safety management. The responsibility for safety cases rests with Railtrack. What discussions has the Minister had with Railtrack about the documents that we are debating? Will any improvements be made to its approval system for safety cases? Perfectly reasonable new stock is awaiting safety approval by Railtrack before it can be brought into service. Consumers are desperately in need of the services, so can we speed up safety cases without compromising safety?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we have had discussions on all such matters with Railtrack and all the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
bodies involved, as my hon. Friend would expect. I agree that the wait for safety case approval is frustrating, and we must be mindful of the possibility that the directives may slow down or inhibit the approval of safety cases. Under the new regime, however, the HSE will have to approve each safety case, and we want to ensure that it has the resources and facilities to do so expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the longer term, an advantage of the policy is that rolling stock will be common and standard throughout Europe. That is for the long term, but it may ease some of the technical problems of approval to which my hon. Friend alluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the answers he gave to questions from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and the hon. Member for Ludlow? The Railway Forum estimated the cost of the directives at £3 billion. Is that the cost that he objects to imposing on the railway companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the costs that has been mentioned. The overall cost will depend on the level at which the system is implemented across the network, and the cost to which the hon. Gentleman alludes is simply one of the estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to consider the costs carefully, and weigh them against the benefits. The Transport Sub-Committee made that point. As I said to the hon. Member for Ludlow, the potential cost of fitting a safety system throughout the whole network is substantially more than £3 billion. Someone said that it might cost the Government's entire budget for a whole year, and indeed, the cost could be ludicrous if we chose that approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the question asked by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), may I ask where the money will come from to cover the cost of implementing the measures? Does the Minister expect the private sector and the train operating companies to bear the brunt? How much Government assistance will be given as a proportion of the whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the cost of the purchase of the rolling stock will be borne by the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will doubtless recognise the problems caused by skill shortages in the UK railway industry. The phenomenon exists across Europe, too. With the enlargement of the European Union, there will be a tendency for new contractors and people to come across from the new entrant countries. What is being done with new entrant countries, bearing in mind the fact that their railways have different standards and a different culture of safety?. I am particularly mindful of contractors involved in infrastructure improvements and civil engineering projects on our railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises two important points, the first of which is the skills shortage, which we are addressing but which is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
problem across the transport industry and perhaps many other industries in this country. As our economy has picked up—it is the most successful in Europe— skills shortages have developed in some industries. We are addressing that, but it would be as well for the industry to do so as well. The Government are playing their part but the industry should do something about its image.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I recently attended the commercial vehicle motor show with the Road Haulage Association, which is putting on workshops for children in schools to raise awareness of the transport industry. We had discussions about children going into professions on the railways as well as on the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised an important point about European Union accession states. We are mindful that a number of countries are now moving into a position from which they may be able to join the EU. We have several twinning projects under way between this country and the accession states that address some of his concerns. Other twinning projects that may address some of those important matters are in the pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the interoperability directive is to raise standards to the best possible level. It is my ambition to raise standards of rolling stock, the running of the trains and the personnel on them to the highest levels. Where safety cases are made, we want to ensure that we do not reduce existing UK standards or allow new standards to be set that are below existing standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission talks about giving precedence to the most cost-effective investment according to the principle of interoperability. How will that be implemented? Will investment have to be cost-effective for the Commission, the Government or the railway companies? It might be helpful if the Minister were to illustrate his response by telling the Committee at what point a regional railway line would meet the standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Investment would have to be cost-effective in achieving the ambitions set out in the communication—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cost-effective for whom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the industry, the countries and the economy. Those issues would have to be considered. The investment would be considered cost-effective to the extent that it reached the objectives set out in the communication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know of the different track gauges at the frontiers of Europe. There is a difference in track gauge between Spain and France, to which the European transport White Paper referred. Work is under way to build a standard-gauge route through to Barcelona. Will the spending required to implement such projects come from the national Governments or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
operators? Will taxpayers across Europe have to cough up so that, for example, people from Scarborough and Whitby are supporting railways in Seville?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that the good constituents of Scarborough and Whitby, whom my hon. Friend represents assiduously, would not have to pay the bill for co-ordinating the gauges between France and Spain. Countries such as Spain, Portugal and France will have to address such issues nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I await correction on this point, and if there is some other information I will ensure that my hon. Friend gets it, but I think it probable that only if such a project were part of the trans-European networks, or TENs, for which the funding comes from the European Union, would it be possible for it to be underwritten. I will ensure that that matter is teased out, because I would not want the good constituents of Scarborough and Whitby to be in any way disadvantaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his response to my question about the time scale for implementing the Cullen recommendation on an independent investigation body? I entirely understood why he said that it was important that whatever we do ties in with the overall European picture, but I am concerned that the time scale of the package of proposals from Europe will slow down the implementation of some vital recommendations in the Cullen report in this country. What are the Government doing to speed up the process of reaching a conclusion on the proposals? The way things normally work with European institutions it could be a long time before anything concrete emerges, and that could slow down the process of achieving safety improvements in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's question. He rightly implies that some urgency is necessary in addressing the matter. To set up the body to which he refers would require primary legislation, and the Queen's Speech announced that in this Session the Government would publish proposals for implementing the Cullen recommendations that would require primary legislation. We will publish a consultation paper in the next few months, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, the timing of the legislation will depend on the availability of parliamentary time. It is our ambition to seek to allocate some of that time at an early opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister update the Committee on the ongoing negotiations under the Vilnius protocol, which concerns international carriage by rail? Is he in a position to update the Committee on the progress of those important discussions, and tell us when they will be concluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to give my hon. Friend information about that, but I do not have at my fingertips the detailed information that he would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
require. If he would like me to jot him a line, I should be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoban</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the extent to which the interoperability provisions apply to trains that will not run on trans-European routes? I suspect that there are trains used on the lines in Scarborough and Whitby that will not be used on the Scarborough to Seville route, the prospect of which was held out to us earlier. Will there be derogations from the interoperability criteria for equipment, as there are from the applicability of the Berne gauge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. I was not thinking so much of Scarborough and Whitby, but of that nice little line that goes from St. Erth to St. Ives in Cornwall. I do not think that that will ever form part of the trans-European networks. I do not think that a rail link between Madrid and St. Ives will go ahead. The point is important, and it would be absurd if the interoperability rules operated across the whole network. Who knows? They may have resonance in some areas. I know the rail lines around Scarborough and Whitby well. I spent my childhood years in places such as Grosmont and Egton Bridge, which the rail line runs through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the proposals as they stand would arise if some of the lines were upgraded and interoperability had to be considered. At that point we would seek derogation when there was no economic case for interoperability. Where no cost-benefit analysis showed economic benefits, we would want the ability for derogation within the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to make Scarborough and Whitby the theme of the morning, but the Minister will know that my constituency is famous not only for its fish and chips, but for exporting them. Many of the exports from the McCain chip factory in Scarborough go to Europe—in heavy goods vehicles, unfortunately. Equally, fish caught off the coast in Whitby, especially shellfish, are exported to the main fish markets in places such as Barcelona and Paris. The people involved in such activities would benefit greatly from improved railway links, especially when stock is refrigerated. Those industries are important to my constituents, and there are other similar industries around the country. How will they benefit from interoperability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That very important question goes to the nub of the issue. The ability to move freight from one place in the EU to a distant part of it without having to unload and reload trains is what the debate is all about. There could be huge benefits for Scarborough and Whitby and many other parts of the country. My hon. Friend will see that the benefits will come in the long term rather than the short or medium term, because many issues and costs need to be tackled. As he pointed out, some expensive changes would probably have to be made to the gauge—I use that word in its broadest sense—of the system in this country. In terms of the technical standards and the rolling stock, refrigerated wagons
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
are expensive. Some advantages could be derived from economies of scale, and a more efficient system might be created in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister and other hon. Members on their discipline, as there have been 21 questions and 21 answers. That seems to have exhausted the questions, and if no hon. Members want to ask any more, we can proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union documents No. 5721/02, Commission Communication 'Towards an integrated European railway area', No. 5744/02, draft Directive on the safety of the Community's railways, No. 5723/02, Draft Directive amending Council Directive 96/48/ BC and Directive 2001/16/BC on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, No. 5724/02, draft Regulation establishing a European Railway Agency, No. 5726/02, Recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate the conditions for Community accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), and No. 5727/02, draft Directive amending Council Directive 91/440/BBC on the development of the Community's railways; and endorses the Government's approach to negotiations on these proposals in the Council.</p></blockquote>
In essence, the Government's stance is to support the proposed further liberalisation of the freight market, and to seek to ensure that it is progressed at the same time as further technical harmonisation. The further harmonisation proposals should be shaped to deliver benefits to rail passengers and freight customers rather than to impose additional costs on the industry, which would largely be borne by Europe's taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.14 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The liberalisation of freight is extremely welcome, and we support it, so there is no need for me to say anything more on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, whether someone is a purveyor of fish and chips in Scarborough or is sitting on the 8.20 from Shenfield, in my constituency, to Waterloo, he has a right to ask, "What's in it for me? What will I get out of interoperability?" I can think of no better answer than to quote paragraph 9·72 of the Cullen report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposals appear not to have been framed with specific reference to the position in Britain. It is not clear whether they are based on any comprehension of the nature, range and application of Railway Group Standards in regard to safety or non-safety matters, and it may be that they are intended to address matters in other counties which have no counterpart in Britain."</p></blockquote>
The debate so far has been noticeable for several reasons. First, I am indebted to the Minister for introducing an entirely new concept into the costing of interoperability by suggesting that the changes involved would require the Government's budget for an entire year. Previously, the highest estimate was £45 million, which is the size of a district council's budget. The highest estimate, from the Railway Forum, was £3 billion, but that has been resisted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
until now. No doubt the Minr will now be asked lots of parliamentary questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marvellous fish and chips in Scarborough and Whitby, of which I had far too much in my youth, bring to mind another question: who will pay for the changes and for work on interoperability in Iberia and on crossing the Pyrenees? My understanding is that the trans-European network—TEN—was largely based on the Essen list, and the Commission has now added six more schemes, one of which relates to Iberian interoperability. The taxpayers of Europe will pick up the tab, which might have been reasonable had the original TEN been implemented. The best estimate that I have, however—perhaps the Minister can comment on this—is that only about 20 per cent. of the original infrastructure has been tackled. I also understand that when the Commission first considered the issue, it said that it should tackle problems on existing routes, not create new ones such as routes through the Pyrenees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several concerns. I said that we welcomed the treatment of freight in the directives, but there seems to be an emphasis on working towards introducing a designated freight network alongside dedicated high-speed passenger services and the trans-European network. The problem is that 50 per cent. of passenger miles in this country are travelled on the commuter network in the south-east. The Railway Forum says that such networks are at saturation point, and the creation of freight-only corridors or lines is impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the problems of rail freight in Britain cannot be tackled. The Minister was right to say that there has been a considerable increase in traffic, and that that is a good thing, which is largely due to liberalisation. In tackling problems here, however, we should remember that more practical solutions could achieve considerable savings. We should think more sensibly about passing loops for freight trains, and consider expanding freight yard development and reopening certain lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for high speed, a lot of member states, and particularly Britain, seem to be missing the point. We have problems with interoperability around local bottlenecks, particularly the London terminals, most of which must be reached over viaducts, which is a problem. Another good example of the bottleneck problem is Leeds. I was interested to see that on the lines planned for the trans-European network, the east coast line to Edinburgh specifically excludes Leeds. It would make a significant difference to the line if something were done about the approaches to Leeds. It is an irony that the city has a beautiful spanking new station, and the line is terrifically fast, but, as hon. Members who have used it know, one often travels in enormous comfort and at enormous speed, only to spend 20 minutes outside Leeds station waiting to go in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to give the hon. Gentleman information of which he is unaware. Under the current project, £140 million is being spent on Leeds, a substantial part of which is being used to treat the problems of the bottleneck to which he refers. Some 10 years ago, under a Conservative Government, I did some work on the approach viaducts to bring about those changes. By the beginning of the next timetable the bottleneck problems will have been dealt with. I am sure that Railtrack will be only too pleased to show the hon. Gentleman what it has achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that, but I have talked on that subject with Richard Bowker, who takes a less sanguine view of it than the hon. Gentleman does. Anyway, I was using Leeds as an illustration of a larger problem—although if Leeds' problems are sorted out in the medium term, so much the better. My substantive point is not about Leeds, however, or King's Cross or Paddington for that matter; it is about the effect of local bottlenecks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reinforce what my hon. Friend says? I am sure that he knows from his personal experience of coming in from Shenfield that Liverpool Street station has a similar bottleneck problem. One can have a reasonably good journey until one gets close to Liverpool Street, and then spend several minutes crawling in or sitting static. Leeds is not by any means a one-off in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a common problem with all London termini—they all face the problem of viaduct approaches. A good network often comes down to a narrow point at which trains are backed up. If the White Paper showed greater understanding of the need to eliminate bottlenecks, it would have a greater effect in creating interoperability. That is why I am so worried about moving on to the six new projects, and the reference to the problems in Iberia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of safety. I hope that the Minister will forgive me—the problem with railways is that there are so many acronyms and we end up falling over ourselves—but I think that he was mistaken in suggesting that the TPS, or train protection system, would reduce capacity. It is true that the ERTMS, certainly at level 1, would reduce capacity; there is no doubt about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop the point before giving way to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding about level 1 is that train drivers will tend to ride the brakes, thinking along the lines of, "You're as good as the last signal you got." That would have an effect on capacity—or at least, that was how it was explained to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big debate is about whether to make the change to level 2, which offers digital radio and real-time planning for railway safety. Given that we shall not get a penny of European money unless we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
some form of ERTMS, the question is whether we will go for level 1, as was suggested by Cullen, or for level 2, as suggested by the Strategic Rail Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could, perhaps, have spared the hon. Gentleman the last two minutes of his speech if he had given way to me earlier. May I now tell him that it was not me who made the point about TPWS reducing capacity? I think that it was the hon. Member for Ludlow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I forgive the hon. Gentleman. That is, of course, the case. However, the record will show that he agreed, because he went on to say that that was connected with the point that I made about the shift from rail to road. I am certain about that, because it caused consternation on this Bench and eye rolling in other parts of the Room by those who are experts on the matter. I am sure that the record will show that the Minister agreed with the hon. Member for Ludlow about TPS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on to further questions of safety. Our railways have a good safety record. Improvements are planned and put together where practical. I approve of what the Minister said about ensuring that such things are cost-effective and that there is a proper balance. However, worries and warnings have been expressed with regard to the creation of the European body, in particular by the Railway Forum, which says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Creation of a European-level safety agency will require the industry to adapt to its existence and interface with it and any layers of management that are subsequently introduced,"</p></blockquote>
and comments that that is likely to be costly. It goes on to give a stark and worrying warning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The industry is now in the process of implementing a number of the latter's recommendations"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the proposals in the Cullen report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any EU legislation must take account of the current domestic situation."</p></blockquote>
It continues, starkly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a limit to the amount of capacity in the UK industry to accommodate and assimilate change."</p></blockquote>
Those views are shared by the Select Committee. The European Rail Agency sees it as a first step towards complete integration of the European railways. We have heard the views of the Cullen report about how relevant that is. Now that the Minister has had time to consider the matter, we need to hear from him what will happen with ERTMS, because ERTMS is central to interoperability and to the various reports. Apart from a couple of small pilots, there is nothing about it in the 10-year strategic plan, so any support that the Government give to this will be meaningless without a definitive answer as to whether they intend to go for level 2 of ERTMS. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reinforce some of the points that I made in questions, and thank the Minister for his answers regarding the situation at
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Sangatte. I know that the British Government are engaged in discussions with the French Government, but it strikes me that the proposals that we are considering will come to nothing unless the French Government can be seen to deliver. For the record, it is worth noting the fact that EWS has lost 2,500 freight train journeys and its losses are approaching £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of businesses around the country that are close to going to the wall, or have already gone to the wall, because of the lack of interoperability between the UK and the continent and because of illegals jumping on to freight trains. Indeed, only this morning the "Today" programme told us of another great transgression, but the French authorities do not seem to be paying even Gallic lip service to the problem. I support my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues in their attempts to move the situation forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is a matter of lack of policing—and the fact that people are not charged with offences—does the hon. Gentleman feel that it would be sensible for companies that are close to bankruptcy to embark on a lengthy legal process with the Commission against the French Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for that reason that I urge the Government not only to keep up with their work but to take every opportunity to explain to the new French Administration the damage that is being done to the wider European project in terms of logistics and the free movement of goods and people. That is the key point that I want to reinforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on to my seaside contribution, and my question about fish and chips—getting Whitby fish to Barcelona and Paris, and getting the frozen chips made at the excellent McCain chip factory in my constituency to the continent. The Strategic Rail Authority is already looking seriously at the missing link of the railway line between Pickering in north Yorkshire and Rillington junction. I know that the Minister is aware of it, because I have bent his ear on that subject on many occasions—although I have not yet got round to hitting him over the head with a damp fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will take a closer interest of the work being done by the SRA on the possibility of filling in the links in the nation's railway network, because the possibilities for freight transport for the future viability—and, indeed, the renaissance—of the port of Whitby suggest that an effective land link of the sort that I suggest, particularly the renewal of its links to the east coast main line via the York to Scarborough route, would pay considerable dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The considerable resources of Forest Enterprise will soon be put to harvesting the timber from Dalby forest, and I am sure that the Minister would want to see that timber being moved around by train rather than on heavy goods vehicles. Indeed, we Government Back Benchers want to see more

freight go by rail. We want to see those changes made to our national and European transport policies, and I wish the Minister well in his discussions with his colleagues in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit nervous about making this speech, Mr. O'Hara, because I have left my anorak behind. I was beginning to wonder whether the debate would degenerate into a discussion about all the charming little railway lines that can be found around the country in places such as in Scarborough and Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome any move towards interoperability across the European rail network and the liberalisation of rail freight. The more freight that can be carried by rail the better, especially for the environment. However, I have a number of concerns about the Government's approach. The Minister has said nothing to suggest that the Government will be doing anything to push the time scale, but it will probably take a minimum of 15 years to implement the changes. I would have thought that if the Government were leading the way on an environmental agenda for Europe, they would be trying to push the European Union to speed up the process. The Minister has said nothing today to suggest that that is the case. In fact, I am worried that the opposite might be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my earlier questions caused some interesting confusion over TPWS and ERTMS and the effects on capacity. The history of rail in this country shows that once something is introduced, there is great reluctance to change it or invest in something new. TPWS will be introduced by the end of next year and there is some movement towards ERTMS level 1, but if there is to be interoperability with Europe, we need ERTMS level 2, which would entail no capacity problems. I am concerned that there is still some ambivalence on the part of the Government about whether those steps will be taken. They seem to want to leave decisions to other bodies, although I would have thought that Government Ministers should be leading the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned that there is a lack of clarity about where the money will come from. The Minister has spoken about some staggering cost implications, which I am sure will be mentioned many more times in future. He said that that would be a matter for the train operating companies, but I fail to see how the train operating companies could bear such costs, even over a long time scale, and remain even remotely profitable. The only solution is for the Government to find some extra investment, yet there is no indication that they have even begun to think about where the money might come from. We seek clarification on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot be particularly proud of our approach to the rail system over the past few decades. I was stunned to hear the hon. Member for Brentwood and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Ongar say that he would like us to open more lines. I very much welcome that, but were not the Beeching cuts made under a Conservative Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inquiry into the Clapham accident in 1985 suggested the implementation of the TPWS system, but nothing significant was done about it at the time. I am concerned that this Government are following the previous Government in dither and delay over modernising our rail system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's approach to negotiations"—</p></blockquote>
but we want to be confident that the Government actually have an approach to the negotiations. From the Minister's remarks, it seems that there are so many grey areas on which the Government have not established a firm position that it is difficult to see how they can adopt any successful approach in their negotiations with Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.39 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly. I apologise to the Minister and other colleagues for missing the opening of the debate, but I was participating in a debate in Westminster Hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise specifically the issue of Sangatte and of people attempting to board the trains, particularly the freight trains, that come through the tunnel. We have heard again and again that, for all sorts of sustainable development reasons, everyone is in favour of encouraging companies to transfer freight from road to rail. If we are to do that, however, much more needs to be done about the problem at Sangatte, because those who take commercial decisions at the margins will be deterred from using rail if they believe that the freight service is not reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was raised some weeks ago when the Committee debated the European White Paper. Ministers were pressed to put further pressure on the French Government to do something about the problem at Sangatte, not least because of its serious effect on companies such as EWS. They gave a commitment to redouble their efforts and to see what could be done, but the problem is still with us several weeks later. EWS is virtually bankrupt; it was told that efforts would be redoubled, but they clearly have not been. There is a new, albeit temporary, Administration in France, and I appeal to Ministers—as, I am sure, do my colleagues—to do everything they can to take advantage of that window of opportunity. If they leave the issue much longer, there will not be much of a company left to save.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, we have had a useful and helpful debate. We have taken an extensive tour of the European Union, and stopped off at the seaside in

The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked what was in all this for the ordinary person, and that is always a good question to ask when examining legislation or directives. It is sometimes difficult to interpret such measures in terms of the benefits for the ordinary person in the street, but the directives will open up rail freight markets, stimulate competition and innovation, and perhaps provide many new market opportunities for this country. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby rightly mentioned the export and import situation in his constituency, and the directives will ease the situation there. They could also take large amounts of traffic off the roads. Those are just some of the benefits that could flow from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned several improvements that should be made in the United Kingdom, and many of his points made good sense. As he said, many improvements are already under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned bottlenecks in the system, which are important. Under the first rail package, in directive 2001/14/EC, infrastructure managers are required to introduce investment plans to identify and tackle bottlenecks on the network. The separate proposal on the trans-European network dealt with those issues in a European context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got a bit bogged down on train protection systems. I hope that the record is clear, but I shall attempt to clarify it further. I did not say—or if I did, I did not mean to—that the proposed train protection systems would reduce capacity on the rail system, but the hon. Member for Ludlow suggested that they might. I was saying that if we went for the very highest level of train protection for all lines and all rolling stock across the country, the cost would be huge, which must be self-evident to anyone in the Committee. I hope that that clarifies the issue. I assure the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that we have no intention of spending the whole Government budget in that way—even if we put a penny on tax, as the Liberal Democrats often want us to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, railways in the United Kingdom have a good safety record; that point needs to be made. We do have a good safety record, and rail is one of the safest ways to travel; it is certainly safer than using the road, and I am pleased to endorse that comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I gave the Minister the benefit of the doubt in my original contribution. I am sure that it was an unintentional slip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has now clarified that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby and the hon. Member for Rayleigh
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
(Mr. Francois) raised the issue of the situation at the other end of the channel tunnel. They were right to do so, and I think that I expressed my view forcefully in my answer. I can assure them that the Minister for Transport has actively pursued the matter, and that when the new Transport Ministers are in place in France we shall make solid representations to them. In the case of the latest incursion that has been reported, I believe—although I stand to be corrected if necessary—that the people involved boarded the train at a considerable distance from the tunnel and may have travelled a long way across Europe. That is a separate issue that must be addressed, but it is not the same as the problem at the other end of the tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby also made his point about the line from Pickering to Rillington junction; he never misses an opportunity to make that point on behalf of his constituents. I do not know whether he has shares in McCain, but he must have constituents who work there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend points to his midriff and says that he has a vested interest. I am not sure what he means by that. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar seems to be saying that he has a vested interest too.

We have heard about fish being transported directly from Whitby to Madrid. To make a lighter point, some of the fishermen who work off my constituency, as well as those who work off that of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, probably regret that some of the fish is transported directly from the sea to Madrid, in Spanish ships.

The hon. Member for Ludlow donned his anorak. I knew that I had seen him somewhere before; his face looked familiar. He is the guy whom I have seen standing at the end of railway platforms with his little camera and his little notebook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can safely confirm to the Committee that I have never worn an anorak on the end of a railway platform.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has disappointed me. He looked like a railway buff, but he has completely rejected that idea and rebutted what I said. However, we are always pleased to have clarity. He asked about speeding up the process, and we are anxious to do that. However, he will appreciate that these are matters of considerable complexity and we would not want to progress them with undue haste. We have a capacity to get things

wrong, and we must move at a pace that is compatible with making sure that we reap the benefits of interoperability and co-operation across the European Union.

I reject what the hon. Gentleman said about dither and delay in modernising the rail system. In recent years we have made a huge leap forward in investing in the rail system, after years of—	<i>[Interruption].</i> The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar chuckles away to himself, but we witnessed a lack of investment year after year when his party was in Government. That brought us to the situation that we are in now. For the first time for a long time, we have one of the highest levels of investment in rail in the European Union. An enormous amount of money is being spent on the system and we are very mindful that we need to improve it, for the sake both of the movement of freight and passengers and for the success of our economy.
