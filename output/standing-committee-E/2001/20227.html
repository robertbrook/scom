<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind all members of the Committee that pagers and mobile phones should function silently or not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My opening statement will be brief. As hon. Members will know, we had an annual fisheries debate in December, and I was pleased that business managers managed to secure a full day for that. Last year, the Scrutiny Committee considered the relevant matter, in addition to its being dealt with in debate, and hon. Members said then that it was useful for them to have a second opportunity in the new year to talk through fisheries issues, including total allowable catches and quotas.<br><br>
I understand that hon. Members will have a surfeit of opportunity this year. The Scrutiny Committee recommended this debate on the common fisheries policy review and a range of attached documents, which have been circulated to the Committee. Those are all important issues, on which I am sure hon. Members will have a view. The common fisheries policy review in particular is important, but there are others, such as the Court of Auditors report and third-country agreements, about which some hon. Members have expressed legitimate concern; issues arise for serious consideration by the Commission. I understand that a further Scrutiny Committee debate will take place on this year's TACs and quotas.<br><br>
I am happy to take questions and appreciate the opportunity for more detailed debate. It will be a busy year for fisheries issues. The cod fisheries review is due this year and we expect a paper from the Commission.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
I believe that it aims to produce that by April— perhaps the end of April. It may miss the April Fisheries Council, but hon. Members will have an opportunity to see it. Also, we must finalise the cod recovery programmes. The debate about that matter will be very important. We have made great progress with respect to cod and hake, two species that are under particular threat, and I pay tribute to the fishing industry for its active involvement in that progress. The Government try to encourage involvement by the fishing industry at all levels in conservation and technical discussions, and in negotiations—the negotiations with the Commission as well as the European Union-Norway talks. We appreciate the industry's constructive engagement with that process.<br><br>
A great deal remains to be done. A range of commercial stocks is still in difficulty and we cannot be complacent. We shall need to do an awful lot of work, and we shall engage in on-going debate about technical conservation measures, effort management, and the issue of structural funds and fleet structures in the European Union, which is dealt with in one of the documents before the Committee today. A problem of overcapacity in the total European Union fleet remains, and we shall have to turn our minds to that in the Council this year, particularly in dealing with such issues as how public funds should be used, and their use in construction and modernisation. That aspect of the use of public funds has not had a good history, given the increase of capacity and the use of more and more effort in relation to fish stocks.<br><br>
I know that the Scrutiny Committee wanted an opportunity for debate on a range of issues, and I am happy to be here to answer questions today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have until about 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that those questions should be brief and asked one at a time. That will leave ample opportunity for hon. Members to raise several questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Ann Winterton<span class='memberconstituency'> (Congleton) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the cod and hake recovery programme. Will he confirm that vessels that have used their allocation of kilowatt days when fishing for cod or hake will be permitted to continue to fish for other species?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear on the hon. Lady's point about kilowatt days. I assume that she is referring to the beam trawl segment, where there is effort control in relation to days at sea. If my assumption is correct, I can tell her that producer organisations manage their days at sea with reference to the effort and quota available to them. I hope that I have understood her point. If not, I am happy to come back to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn <span class='memberconstituency'> (Scarborough and Whitby) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the cod recovery plan in the North sea. Can he advise the Committee of the state of play in terms of the Norwegians and their net sizes? I have received representations from fishermen in communities in Whitby and Scarborough who are very concerned that the Norwegians do not seem to be sticking to their end of the bargain. What is the EU's position on that?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned if my hon. Friend's constituents feel that the Norwegians are not sticking to their side of the bargain. They are generally very good at enforcing their agreements. The position is that anybody fishing for cod in the Norwegian zone must use a 120 mm net size. I met some of my hon. Friend's constituents yesterday. They came to talk about the interpretation of the agreement in relation to the EU-Norway talks on the North sea, and about the practice of carrying both 80 mm and 120 mm nets in relation to a directed cod fishery. It is quite legal for vessels to carry those two net sizes, but they are subject to limitations in relation to catch composition. That was the point that my hon. Friend's constituents wanted to clarify.<br><br>
We have taken into account both our own and the Commission's legal interpretations. Our interpretation of the rules is exactly the same as that of SEERAD—the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department—in the Scottish sector and that of other member states. I know that it is not the interpretation that the industry would like, and I have expressed concern that the industry felt that the matter had been misunderstood in its negotiations on the regulations. I hope that we can rectify that in the future, so that the industry is aware of what is intended by these rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George<span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, there was broad cross-party support for the bulk of the Commission's common fisheries policy reform Green Paper. Much of it was relatively uncontentious, concerning the maintenance of relative stability and—we hope—the six and 12-mile limits.<br><br>
The paper also contained some welcome indicators—although they were rather generalised—that the Commission may be moving towards the establishment of regional management committees to deliver some of the enforcement and management of policy. Many people who are concerned about the future of the industry believe that to be a good idea. In the Minister's discussions with his counterparts in Europe and within his own Department, what progress has been made in putting flesh on the bones of that concept?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are making some good progress on that matter. We believe that it would be in the interests of the fishing industry and of our fishermen to establish such committees. Incidentally, we also believe that it would be in the interests of other member states and their fishing industries. It would allow some flexibility within the operation of the CFP and engage the industry more closely, which is the right way forward. We welcome the Commission's inclusion of the matter in the Green Paper.<br><br>
To be frank, some member states have been suspicious about exactly what it all means. They suspect that somehow it is an opportunity to exclude or restrict their rights. However, that is not the case; that is not what the Commission means, and nor is it what we mean on regional management. The common fisheries policy in its present form is an inflexible and monolithic structure. It needs a little more movement within it to reflect the differing nature of fisheries throughout the European Union and, indeed, around our own coast. The nature of fishing differs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
tremendously between the north of Scotland and the south of Cornwall, and the regional nature of fisheries should be reflected. We welcome the Commission's actions, and we intend to make progress with them. We have also made efforts to reassure member states that were uncertain about them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question is about the enlargement of the European Union. What discussions have there been on the subject under debate with nations that are likely to join?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Discussions are under way. Fisheries agreements have been made with some of the accession states, in the normal way in which countries agree annually. The accession of the candidate countries should not pose a great problem in relation to the common fisheries policy. We are bound by the principle of relative stability. Countries such as Poland and the Baltic states have fishing interests, although not in the North sea. The principle of relative stability does not give them the right to the quota in the North sea that has been distributed as it stands in the common fisheries policy.<br><br>
All those issues will have to be negotiated as part of accession. If the principle of relative stability holds, there should be no difficulties in relation to the accession states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will obviously be hard negotiations with the Commission on the establishment of sensible effort measures. I want to rephrase the question that I asked earlier, to make it clearer. If a vessel has had its days limited because of its cod catch, will it be able to fish against other stocks when it has used up its quota effort?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The days allocated under the scheme would be the total of days permitted for the vessel in the year, so the answer is as I thought. Discussion on the subject is at an early stage in Brussels, and I am sure that we can deal with any problems. It is not unusual to have restrictions on a species. That happens now in relation to quota. Vessels can run out of quota for a species and can still fish, but cannot retain that species. That is not an ideal solution but, in the management of quota, vessels take care to ensure that they have some quota to cover an accidental by-catch, so that they can keep it commercially. These days, vessels can also trade and lease quota. We may want to consider the kilowatt day in terms of flexibility. That is still for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The documents recognise the importance of the processing industry in this country compared with other parts of the EU. That is quite right from the perspective of Members of Parliament who represent fishing communities. Is the Minister in a position to anticipate whether the Commission is more likely to be favourable to marketing and restructuring initiatives? What type of application of structural funds for such an important part of the industry does he expect the Commission to go for in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to have that discussion but, in relation to the talks that the Council of Ministers has had, the thinking of the Commission and some other member states appears similar to our own. The use of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
public funds to expand fishing capacity by new build, even with an aggregation penalty, is not sustainable and not a good use of such funds. We do not say that we should not support our fishing industry—we do, through structural funds; we say that the funds should go to areas where fishermen can maximise the value of their catch. In our country, that includes giving support for refrigeration equipment on vessels, and for marketing and processing and some onshore facilities connected with that. It is appropriate to give such support to maximise returns to the industry, but we do not want public subsidies to increase the amount of fishing capacity in European Union waters. I strongly believe that, and it is a matter that we shall have to argue about at the Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When do the Government intend to introduce shellfish licensing? Clearly, there is support for it and worry has been expressed about when it will happen. I should be grateful if the Minister would say when such licensing will be in place and what steps the Government will take to enforce the licensing system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very committed to the shellfish licensing scheme. It is the right way forward. Some delicate negotiations have taken place with the industry. We have been trying to take into account its views, which, as the hon. Gentleman may appreciate, are not always unanimous on such issues. Sometimes, conflicts arise about pot limits among the shellfish sector, the more mobile sector and people who do not fish shellfish, but who may want to do so at some stage. Last December, the negotiations were quite difficult and my Department has been stretched with common fisheries policy reviews. I accept that there has been some slippage, but I want to see the matter progress quickly and I am working towards that end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban<span class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Green Paper shows that the amount of money that is spent on the common fisheries policy from the pockets of European Union taxpayers is 1.1 billion euros compared with a value of about 9 billion euros. What does the Minister believe is an appropriate level of public subsidy for the fishing sector?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. It is not easy to answer because, overall, the fishing industry is a small part of our national gross domestic product. We must also accept that, in some parts of the country, the fishing industry is of particular regional importance, and the level of support depends on the different regions where the industry is active. I have not given a precise answer, because I cannot give an exact figure. However, the approach that we must take is to recognise that fisheries are of regional importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The documents before us this afternoon recognise the number of women throughout the Community who are involved in fish processing. Has the Commission or the Minister considered the tremendous socio-economic impact of that on some of the poorest communities throughout the European Union and how that could be affected by the changes in patterns of fishing and the amount of fish that would be available as a raw material? Is there any possibility of giving further socio-economic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
assistance to those fishing communities that could be hard hit, particularly the women, who often have to keep a large family together on the income from their employment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The processing sector of the industry employs a lot of workers, many of whom are women. Many processing factories are in areas that currently qualify for regional assistance. Like any food industry, the factories qualify for selective assistance, depending on what it is, whether they are expanding and where they are. In some cases, they can also qualify under the marketing and processing grant. There is facility for the industry. We recognise that its processing side is a big employer and an important part of our food industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with effort control—capacity reduction—as set out in Council document 12475/01. It reports that the United Kingdom has met its global objectives for multi-annual guidance programme reductions, but not for tonnage. That raises the question of whether we are better off employing effort control or capacity reduction. There is keenly-felt debate in the industry about whether fishermen are more likely to accept decommissioning schemes or different methods of effort control, which, in the main, they tend to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. There is debate within the industry about effort control versus other methods of fisheries management, in particular quotas and total allowable catches. In my view, there has to be a combination of the two. There is no doubt that there is overcapacity in the European Union fleet, so some fleets have to make reductions. Some countries need to make more progress on their MAGP targets. We are not too far off our target and generally fall within it, although some segments do not. There is also the issue of overall tonnage, but generally our progress has been very good.<br><br>
We have recently had a decommissioning round, the results of which will affect our MAGP, which is also linked with a "days at sea" effort management regime. There are arguments for and against effort management. I think that it has some benefits for the industry, but it will not solve overcapacity problems, because fishermen would have to restrict their days at sea to a level at which it would be hard to make a living. We have to make sure that the availability of fish is in line with the capacity of the fleet. A bit of both approaches is therefore probably needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We talk about quotas and volumes. Is there talk at a European level about the health of fish? We are concerned about the health of food, including meat and other products that come under the Minister's responsibility. What is the nature of discussions about the health of fish?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many discussions on the subject. We must recognise that the health of the seas is an important part of the health of the fishing industries. There are biodiversity, conservation and sustainability issues that we realise are compatible with a commercial fishing industry. In fact, in our submission to the CFP review, we emphasised that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
there must be awareness of the environmental impact of the commercial fleet.<br><br>
Quality control of the product is also an issue. Many fishermen realise that it is in their interest to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. A top-quality product commands a premium price, and many of our south-coast fleets export their fish and shellfish to continental markets. Some 90 per cent. of the catch from the south coast goes to the continent. To command the top prices, the catch has to be top quality. The fleets know that and deliver on it. We focus finance, training and health on quality control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Referring back to the Minister's answer to the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George), is not it the Commission's intention that vessels that have caught cod will be limited to kilowatt days and will have no other effort allocation to catch other quotas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. Discussions on that subject have started, because we need clarification of what that means, but no decision has yet been taken by the Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I turn to the issues surrounding salmon fisheries, particularly that in the North sea? The Minister is well informed about the problems of buying out current licences that are available in some of the very old ports that have a tradition of salmon fishing, such as Whitby. Will the Minister advise the Committee whether there is a consistent approach throughout the EU to inshore fishery, which is labour intensive, often seasonal, and sometimes linked to agricultural enterprises, or is there change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are similar concerns and arguments about inshore fishery mainly in the Republic of Ireland. As my hon. Friend rightly says, there are voluntary negotiations between parties with salmon rod fishing interests and the salmon netsmen on the coast about the possibility of buying out some of the licences. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs offered a contribution to the fund, which both sides welcomed. The discussions are well advanced. The Republic of Ireland has expressed concern about the effect of salmon netting and is discussing the issue. That, quite properly, is a matter for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one of its objectives for a future fishing policy, the Commission recognises the importance of promoting
<br><blockquote><p>"responsible and rational exploitation of fishery resources in international waters"</p></blockquote>
and the importance of ensuring coherence with the EC's development policy. That has often been sadly lacking in fishery and agriculture. Last year, the Minister stressed the importance of developing coherence. Will he say what progress is being made, and how confident he is that any changes will ensure that there is coherence to give developing countries a proper chance to develop their own industries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have raised that issue in discussions with the Council, and expressed our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
concerns about several aspects of third country agreements. One concern is that there needs to be a more coherent approach between the development budgets and the development programmes that the EU commissions, as the hon. Gentleman said. The countries involved undoubtedly appreciate that although it is hard currency for them, coastal communities have little involvement in those fisheries. More consideration should be given to that. There are also questions about whether some of the agreements represent value for money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recognise the tensions that have sometimes arisen between the marine scientists and fishermen. There is a suspicion in Scarborough and Whitby that the marine scientists are not spending enough time with the people who are doing the fishing. Is there a consistent approach throughout the EU to research and scientific advice? The key figures that emerge from gathering such information define the targets and the future of the industry. Are other EU countries putting the same considerable resources into research and advice as we are? Are they communicating the importance of that to fishing communities and ensuring that they are involved in the research?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is yes. The commitment to scientific research varies in relation to the fishing industry's involvement. However, there should be no disagreement between the industry and scientists, because they are working towards the same aim: the sustainable management of fish stocks.<br><br>
My Department has gone to great lengths to involve the industry more and to give it more opportunities to talk to scientists and become involved in decisions on matters such as recommendations to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea on the annual surveys of fish stocks. We take the views of people in the industry into account and give them opportunities to travel on our research ships, so that scientists and fishermen can work together and try to reach a common understanding.<br><br>
The situation has improved a great deal in recent years, and I am keen to make more progress. In some countries, fishermen see scientists as their allies, not their enemies, which I am afraid was not always the case here. Fishermen sometimes do not understand why scientists follow certain patterns and do certain things in the course of their research, but because of their increased involvement, they have a better understanding these days. Similarly, scientists have a better understanding of the industry's views. That process is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed that we have undeclared engine power of some 30,600 kW outstanding. Will the United Kingdom be penalised in the number of days that it is allocated, because of that discrepancy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. As I said, the negotiations and proposals are at an early stage; we have yet to reach a conclusion. On the undeclared horsepower, I assume that the hon. Lady is referring to those vessels that have been given a deadline to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
themselves legal. They have a couple of years to do so. Some of the vessels and quite a large chunk of the excess horsepower are not in the cod fishery, so logically it should not count, but those issues will be covered in the negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Janet Dean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burton) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister referred to the need for more discussion with stakeholders in the industry. Does he have an estimate of the percentage of people in the industry who have been involved in one way or another in the discussions? It is important that as many as possible be involved with the ongoing discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. The industry is comparatively small, and I sometimes feel that I have spoken to most of its members at one time or another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, several times in many cases. The industry is well represented by its organisations, which are very active and professional. We ensure that we work through those organisations and, as I said, give fishermen the opportunity to talk to our scientists. They also have that opportunity through their own organisations and one to one. I am always looking for ways of improving and extending the process and of allowing people to make their views known and to talk to scientists about the programmes on which they are working.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What position will the Minister take in negotiations with his European counterparts on the concern about cetacean by-catch in parts of the industry? The Department's own funded research identified that most dolphins and porpoises washed up on beaches on the coastline, mainly in the south-west, were most likely to have been killed as a result of fishing, and there is much speculation that the cause is either pair trawling or industrial trawling. That points to the need for urgent discussions between the Minister and his counterparts in Denmark and France where those activities are mainly based. As the Minister knows bass and mackerel are caught entirely from line in Cornwall and that poses no threat to cetaceans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely accept that hand-liners are very selective and pose no threat to cetaceans. The research programme that we have funded through DEFRA has identified that the main problem is the winter bass fishery. Our observer programmes have not identified cetacean by-catch in other fisheries. We do not close our mind to that. We still carry out the research. We like to have information from other member states' fleets because it is the responsibility of the flag state to collect the information and the science. It needs to be done. We recognise that there is a problem. We are determined to do something about it. Given that it is an international fishery, action must be taken through the European Union to protect dolphins. I have written to Franz Fischler and to my opposite number in France about this. I have also spoken to both of them. This will have to be an ongoing issue.<br><br>
We are considerably more advanced in terms of data collection, research and commitment than other member states; some still need convincing that there is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
a problem. There is still a need for good science to identify where the problem is and to suggest potential solutions. We are financing trials of adapted gear this March, which is designed to keep dolphins out of the nets. It will have a separator grid with an escape hatch on the top of the net. It has been used in New Zealand where it has had a 95 per cent. success rate in reducing sea lion by-catch. It has been used by other countries to reduce the accidental catch of turtles. There is some potential in this. I do not say that in itself it is a solution, but it is worth testing it in the sea and that is what we intend to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The labelling of meat as regards its origin and production has become an important issue for British farmers. Will the same importance be given to those two issues in aquaculture?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is an interesting question. At the present time it is a consumer-driven part of the industry. There has been the development of eco-labels, such as by the Marine Stewardship Council. The supermarkets are beginning to show an interest in organic farmed salmon. Consumers should have information and I welcome labelling schemes. The various industry sectors can join such schemes voluntarily, as can retailers. Some caterers are joining them too, so they will develop. As long as they are properly managed and validated they offer potential benefits to the industry. We are watching this development with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When was the Minister first informed by his civil servants that the European Commission had requested information about the Shetland and Orkney fish purchasing schemes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have seen the date, but I cannot remember exactly when it was. There is no sign of movement from my officials either on this. The hon. Lady will appreciate that the matter falls within the Scottish Executive's area of interest. I am sure that we have those dates and I can let her have them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from my earlier question and the Minister's answer on scientific research, I agree with him about the need to share that research and get the fishing communities more involved in understanding its consequences. The Minister will know that there is a great concern in many North sea ports about the take of fish from seals—grey seals in particular. He will also know that many fishermen are asking for research to be done on that problem, which they encounter every day. In a European context, and leading from the acceptance of these documents and the importance of such scientific research, can the Minister tell the Committee whether substantial and comprehensive research will take place across Europe on the issue? The take is causing a lot of distress to skippers and their families. It particularly affects netsmen involved in inshore work, who leave their nets overnight for 18 hours only to find that much of their harvest has been taken by seals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having seen the result of a disagreement between my neighbours from Grimsby and Cleethorpes, I am reluctant to get involved in issues of seals. More seriously, we recognise that seals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
can cause commercial damage, so we fund research into seal populations, dynamics and predation. The most recent work—it is a little out of date so we are funding some more—suggested that the interaction of seals in the marine food web is complex, and there was no clear evidence that seals had a major impact on commercial fish stocks. I am not saying that they have no impact, but it is difficult to ascertain its level. We shall continue to do that research.<br><br>
We have the majority of seal colonies in Europe. The seals in the Mediterranean—mostly the Mediterranean monk seal—are scarce and endangered, and therefore rightly protected. When stocks are down, there is a tendency to look around to find something to blame. Seals often fit into that category, but it is worth remembering that the seal populations have not yet regained their numbers of before the crash caused by the distemper outbreak in the North sea. It is not as if there has been a huge and historic increase in the seal population. It has increased, but only back to its level before the disease outbreak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to overcapacity in fishing fleets and the importance of the fishing industry to certain regions of the European Union. The Green Paper refers hesitantly to the need to reduce subsidies for construction, which indicates a potential lack of political will in the Commission to push it through. Will the Minister elaborate on what discussions he has had with ministerial colleagues in the EU on the reduction of fishing fleets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a majority view that there is overcapacity in member states. Some member states do not agree entirely and say that, although they have a lot of capacity, it does not matter if the boats go out only Monday to Friday and tie up at the weekend. There are issues of enforcement and the killing power of fleets, which we must take seriously. I must be honest with the Committee and admit that there have been disagreements on the use of public funds for new build. Some member states are keen on subsidies for new build and modernisation, and there is a split in the Council. It is a disagreement of principle. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany—we are backed by the Commissioner—believe that it is not a sustainable use of public funds. It is not good for the fishing industry for capacity to be artificially increased when the earning power in relation to fish stocks is not there. The danger is that it will encourage illegal fishing to keep up with capacity and, in some cases, with the borrowings that are part of the investment. The Commissioner is firmly committed to this principle, as are the UK and other member states. However, strong disagreement exists within the Council. We had a taste of it in December when wrangling about the structural funds broke out. That is why the wording in the Green Paper is careful. The fact that it is there at all demonstrates the Commission's commitment, which is welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister's answer to my last question, he is about to commission further work on seals. If so, would he write to members of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Committee—particularly those in contact with fishing communities—and set out the details? We could then share the information with the industry, which would understand that the work was carrying on. The Minister accepted that current available evidence was somewhat dated and it is important to debunk some of the mischief making at the quayside, notwithstanding the interaction between my hon. Friends the Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, our hon. Friends are represented in the local newspaper as "clubber versus cuddler", which is why I am reluctant to become embroiled in these arguments.<br><br>
I can confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) that research is under way and I will be only too pleased to update him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be a pain, but I should like to return to shellfish licensing. I do not doubt the Minister's personal commitment to introduce it and I recognise the competing priorities within the Department. I know that the Government are enthusiastic about setting targets and wonder whether the Minister could be tempted into offering a target date by which he hopes to introduce a scheme. Would next year be possible? I understand that the sea fisheries committees will be responsible for enforcing a licensing scheme, but they have limited budgets. What work is under way to ensure that they have the capacity to organise and operate a licensing system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I cannot provide the hon. Gentleman with an exact date. I will write and update him on what progress is being made with the negotiations. We have not quite resolved the role of the sea fisheries committees, but I believe that they are the appropriate body to administer shellfish licences within inshore waters. Resource issues are also important: they are complex, which explains why we need enough time to deal with them. I repeat my commitment to making progress on this front.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Commission finds against the Shetland and Orkney fish purchasing scheme, who will be responsible for repaying the moneys already invested, plus interest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The case would probably end up in the European Court. I am sure that the Shetland Islands council, which administers the scheme, would want to challenge any decision of that sort. The Commission has not yet taken the decision. I inquired about the scheme when it was introduced and was assured by the council—and, indeed, by fishermen's organisations—that it was operated as a commercial scheme. The council bought in the quota and the fishing industry leased it at a commercial rate. On that basis, it is difficult to object. It is in the interest of the fishing industry to have some sort of collective ownership of quota. I strongly support the producer organisations.<br><br>
It is right for the industry to organise itself, so I can see the logic of what the Shetland Islands council did. It has some advantages with resources that other parts of the country may not have. However, if it is running the scheme on a commercial basis with a commercial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
lease to the industry—I am assured that that is so and that the Commission is looking into it—it is comparable with arrangements in other parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Turning to the role of key stakeholders in the industry across the Union, Council document 7262/01 of 23 March 2001 refers to their greater involvement, but it seems extremely timid. Can the Minister confirm whether the British Government would be more vigorous in supporting a larger role for key stakeholders in the management of the industry? Will he also tell us which EU members are dragging their heels in that respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is the role of this Committee to name and shame member states. I can assure my hon. Friend that the UK Government would go further than what is set out in the particular document. Progress has been made: joint committees have been set up in relation to the North sea—on flatfish, for example. My hon. Friend is right that the measures are modest, but they are confidence building—step by step. We shall argue for greater involvement, but we are moving in the right direction and building on the gains. We shall pitch our objectives beyond what the Commission is proposing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister more about his support for low-impact fishing? He made it clear earlier that he supports mackerel hand-lining. Towards the end of last year—albeit for a short but profitable period—mackerel hand-liners were unable to go to sea because the quota had been filled. Does the Minister realise that low-impact fishing methods have a genuinely low impact on stocks compared with the trawlers with which they compete for quotas. Does he agree that it is essential for Britain to engage in dialogue with its European partners to establish a pan-European policy in support of low-impact fishing? In the past, the Minister has made his support clear and has acknowledged that it cannot be achieved unilaterally, so what progress is being made in achieving it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in our submission. In our response to the Commission Green Paper, we flagged up the issue of low-impact fisheries and the need for special recognition within the CFP. It will be one of the main negotiating issues ahead. We have underpinned and supported mackerel fisheries and guaranteed the stocks. My officials bent over backwards to achieve a quota for mackerel fisheries and to keep the process open as long as possible—in fact, until just before Christmas, which is not bad going. It meant some juggling around with the mackerel quota, which will have to be resolved in the coming year. The work of my officials demonstrates our commitment to that particular fishery and our recognition of its low-impact status. Some recognition of the Department's work in securing the quota would not be amiss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not many trawlers leave my constituency; indeed, I am not sure what I am doing on the Committee.<br><br>
We are talking about quotas. In the Minister's previous reply, he advanced the interesting notion of good-quality fish being exported. My local chippie tells
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
me that it is expensive because we cannot fish enough. Part and parcel of that problem and of having general quotas, is associated with how we may, or may not, have any regulation on our imports and exports of fish, and whether from that we can extrapolate anything about the quotas for our own trawlers. Will the Minister please comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. This country is not self-sufficient in fish; we rely on third-country imports— traditionally, white fish from Russia, Norway and Iceland—much of which goes into the processing sector. A lot of home-caught fish, especially haddock, goes to fish and chip shops. As I said, much of our premium-quality fish is exported to the continent and to other countries.<br><br>
There is a growing market for the restaurant trade, which will buy only top-quality fish, at top prices, which is good for the industry. I am pleased that many supermarkets have reintroduced fresh fish counters. They, too, want top-quality produce and, encouraged by television cookery programmes, people are becoming more adventurous about the species that they buy. That is good news for the fishing industry and for the consumer, and it has our support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that the Minister's officials bent over backwards to assist mackerel hand-liners late last year, but that was after 300 tonnes had been taken away in November.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment on the Shetland box and the fact that in one week, purse-seiners catch the equivalent of what the mackerel hand-liners in Cornwall catch in one year? In spite of that, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), to whom the issue is of great importance, I encourage the Minister to do all that he can to retain the Shetland box. Many other European nations consider that it sets an unwelcome precedent and will contest it. May I have the Minister's assurance that he will continue to argue strongly for its retention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. The Shetland box is one of our priorities; it was in the Commission's Green Paper that it should remain and we strongly believe that there are sound conservation arguments to retain it, although it is not uncontroversial in our industry. However, it works in a reasonable way and does not inconvenience the industry. It has a sound rationale and we will support it.<br><br>
A mackerel fishery in the hon. Gentleman's constituency takes about 1,000 tonnes of high-value, selective mackerel a year, which fetches a good price, while in Shetland enormous trawlers take huge catches. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland is a member of the hon. Gentleman's party, he may like to negotiate some kind of shift in respect of the large quantity of mackerel in Shetland to increase his quota, which I would support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to safety requirements on products from developing countries, it is thought that more finance will be needed to help them to reach safety standards. Is that in the pipeline?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend mean developing countries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Union is not directly involved in safety standards in the fishing industry of developing countries. There are a growing number of joint ventures between EU vessels and third country vessels, and we expect them to have proper health and safety standards in line with those in the EU. Responsibilities for safety standards in fishing in respect of third, developing countries lie with their Governments. We have an aid programme and it is not impossible that some of that aid could be directed towards such measures. However, I am not aware that that is the case at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now at the end of the time that is allotted to questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 7262/01, the Commission Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), 7263/01, the Commission Report on the state of the resources and their expected development, 7377/01, the Commission Report on the economic and social situation of coastal regions, and 7378/01, the Commission Report on the implementation of the Community system for fisheries and aquaculture over the period 1993-2000; recognises that the review of the CFP offers an important opportunity with considerable implications for the future of fisheries management; supports the Government's view that current positive aspects, notably the access regime, relative stability (including Hague Preference) and the Shetland Box, must continue to operate; agrees that current weaknesses, including the continued use by some Member States of counter-productive subsidies, uneven enforcement, a lack of environmental integration, unsustainable agreements with third countries and the mismatch between fleet capacity and available resources, must be addressed; anticipates with the Government the forthcoming publication by the Commission of its legislative proposals for the review; and supports the Government's efforts to secure the best outcome for the whole of the UK fisheries sector throughout the negotiations.—<i>[Mr. Morley]</i></p></blockquote>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a confession to make, Miss Widdecombe. This is the first time that I have served on European Standing Committee A. I was therefore unsure at what stage to extend the usual courtesies and to welcome you to the Chair. I am slightly fearful of your reputation and I shall do my level best to behave myself. It is a great pleasure that you are chairing our proceedings this afternoon.<br><br>
Some Committee members will want to debate why we have such an environmental disaster on our hands and what practical, technical solutions are on offer. However, I want to concentrate on the legal aspect of fisheries policy because we need to establish that in our minds when considering the future. No doubt the Minister is aware that the future is somewhat prescribed. The Liberal Democrats imagine that we can renegotiate the common fisheries policy, which is not possible for the simple reason that renegotiation must involve all interested parties—all those that signed up to join the European Union—and that unanimity is the order of the day. There is no reason why any other member state would be willing to give up advantages to its own country to benefit the United Kingdom, so renegotiation of the common fisheries policy is a non-starter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
To have a vision for the future, we must understand the past. Many politicians from all political parties find it difficult to acknowledge decisions that were made in the past—so much so that they have ignored them. In the process of so doing, they have deliberately set out to deceive our fishermen and to prevent them at all costs from acquiring knowledge of the facts. I hope to demonstrate the circumstances that presently prevail in the fishing industry and the possibilities for the future are essentially determined by what has been done in the past. The future of the common fisheries policy lies in the contents of past treaties, the guardian of which is the European Commission. It puts forward proposals and it requires unanimous agreement of all member states for the Council of Ministers to change them.<br><br>
Having read the speech of the Spanish Minister to the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament on 22 January, it is obvious that we shall be hard pressed to achieve unanimity. If the Council of Ministers does not put a new management system in place by the end of this year, the acquis communautaire of equal access to a common resource will automatically kick in, as it did for the first 26 days of 1983. The Commission must abide by the treaties. It is bound by the treaties. Under the treaty of the European Community, the common fisheries policy is a direct result of the common organisation of the market in fisheries products.<br><br>
The treaty specifically excludes any form of discrimination between Community producers or consumers. There are presently three separate areas of operation: structural measures, conservation of resources and market organisation. The basic structural measures regulation, 101/76, contains the
<br><blockquote><p>"equal access to a Common Resource without discrimination"</p></blockquote>
principle. It is extraordinary how many member states promote discriminatory proposals.<br><br>
It has also been fascinating to learn that the Scottish nationalists, if they could gain independence for Scotland, would not join the European Union. They are not represented in Committee today, so perhaps the debate does not apply to them. Given that the structural arrangements are part of the acquis communautaire, we should not forget that this so-called future common fisheries policy will be based not on 15 members but on 27, as 10 out of the 12 who are lining up to join have already accepted the acquis communautaire. The two remaining countries—Malta and Poland—are discussing transitional derogations.<br><br>
The acquis communautaire that the new members are accepting, and which all existing Members have accepted, is based on the original article 6 of the treaty of Rome with regard to non-discrimination. Article 6 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Within the scope of application of this Treaty, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on the grounds of nationality shall be prohibited."</p></blockquote>
It must be remembered that the structural measures are the driving force of the multi-annual guidance programmes, and are geared to ensuring that the Community fleet is reduced to the required level to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
allow for the equal access principle to be adopted without discrimination.<br><br>
As we discussed during questions, the Commission is making moves to introduce a days-at-sea regime—effort limitation—as opposed to the past removal of fishing capacity through decommissioning. The basic conservation of resources regulation, 3760/92, continues the discriminatory system of sharing certain stocks under threat and will end at the end of the year. The Council of Ministers can decide to continue it with a further temporary derogation by a qualified majority.<br><br>
Some hon. Members believe that the principle of relative stability will bring benefits. However, the current relative stability arrangements are discriminatory, while the future arrangements will be based on the treaty obligation of non-discrimination. Article 4 of the regulation allows the Council to
<ol>
<li>establish zones in which fishing activities are prohibited or restricted;</li>
<li>limit exploitation rates;</li>
<li>set quantitative limits on catches;</li>
<li>limit time spent at sea taking account, where appropriate, of the remoteness of the fishing waters;</li>
<li>fix the number and type of fishing vessels authorized to fish,</li>
<li>lay down technical measures regarding fishing gear and its method of use;</li>
<li>set a minimum size or weight of individuals that may be caught;</li>
<li>establish incentives, including those of an economic nature, to promote more selective fishing."</li></ol>
Those provisions are contained within Council regulation 1627/94, which lays down general provisions on special fishing permits. They have been cleverly interwoven into the treaty of Corfu—the treaty of accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. The UK Parliament accepted the treaty and passed the European Communities (Accession) Act 1994, which amended the European Communities Act 1972. All hon. Members had the opportunity to disagree with, and defeat, that legislation. However, they did not.<br><br>
Market organisation is often overlooked. The current basic regulation is 104/2000. It places considerable responsibility on producer organisations to ensure that their members adhere to strict, predetermined regimes to match the production or catching of fish to the supply to the market. Under regulation 2508/2000, producer organisations must draw up detailed operational programmes for species such as plaice, cod, haddock, mackerel, hake, monkfish, sole, turbot, sea bass and edible crabs. Where a species is a significant share of the production by value or volume of a producer organisation—some 5 per cent. for species subject to quotas according to the regulation—the catch plan must include an indicative supply schedule for the fishing year that is based on seasonal trends in price, production and demand in the market. The plan must be submitted to the Ministry within seven weeks from 1 January and the Ministry must approve the plan within 12 weeks from 1 January. The Commission must carry out checks to ensure that those conditions are complied with and may, in the light of such checks, request that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
a member state withdraw recognition of a producer organisation. Again, emphasis is placed on where to fish, what to catch and how to supply the market.<br><br>
The situation in Shetland and Orkney regarding notices Aid C 87/2001 and Aid C 88/2001 will affect the marketing strategy and catch plan for the Shetland producer organisation. Quota seems to be held in a pool within that producer organisation until it is leased to fishermen. How is it to be accommodated in the catch plans? How do producer organisations that allow their members an annual individual allocation include those in their plans? Do they provide the members concerned with a detailed plan to which to keep over the fishing year? Do they carry out physical checks to ensure that the plans are adhered to? Perhaps the Minister would answer those questions, now or in writing.<br><br>
Will the Minister also explain how closely the Ministry works with producer organisations to ensure that the regulations are adhered to? Interestingly, some organisations may not understand the full extent of their responsibility. The sad situation in Plymouth last week when the Ministry chose to prosecute a number of fishermen, vessel owners and an auction agent is a good illustration of that. The chief executive of a producer organisation appeared as a character witness for the managing director of one of the companies that was being prosecuted, giving evidence against the Ministry; that surely demonstrates that producer organisations in this country are unaware of their enforcement responsibilities. Had producer organisations been adequately informed by the Minister's Department, that person would never have appeared as a witness against the Ministry with which he should, under the legislation, be working.<br><br>
All three areas of the common fisheries policy are connected to Council regulation 1627/94 of 27 June 1994, which lays down general provisions concerning special fishing permits. By making that system a treaty obligation, the Commission has ensured that the Community fishing permit will be the future management system used after the end of 2002. That will finalise the link between the common fisheries policy and the common organisation of the market in fisheries products. However, like the European army— call it what one will—I have no doubt that the proposed cod and hake recovery programme is designed to ensure that the future management regime will introduce the Community fishing permit system into all sea areas.<br><br>
The permits presently apply to the Baltic and the western waters. The agreement is linked to the guaranteed share of the quotas contained in regulation 3760/92. The cod and hake recovery programme contains no such guarantees. Furthermore, the proposal allows for the introduction of that system for every species considered under threat and is applicable in all member states. While individual nations and organisations throw their hands up in horror and say no to the proposals, we must not forget that each member state signed the treaty of Corfu. Whatever the permit system is called, it will be based on kilowatt days—days at sea—and the proposal suggests a figure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0034">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
of 0.5 of the average number of kilowatt days used in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The system will result in the same conservation disasters that we have seen evolve over the past 20 years, as fishermen will still have to discard good fish back into the sea and pollute the seabed with dead fish. What would happen if the public could see the rotting mess that the system has caused? If a farmer had to kill the vast majority of his animals and leave them to rot in his field, there would be a public outcry, as there was during the recent foot and mouth epidemic. However, that is what is happening at sea, and the only reason there is no outcry is because the public cannot see it happening.<br><br>
It is no good the Minister talking about technical conservation measures when, after 15 Ministers have had their input into the details, the measures are weakened to such a degree as to become ineffective. At best, the Minister could introduce unilateral measures for British fishermen, as he did when minimum landing sizes for lemon sole and other species—which were of considerable economic importance to the industry in the south-west—were abolished.<br><br>
I hope that, in debating the future of fisheries policy, hon. Members will base their statements on the legal situation, because if there is one thing we must do, it is strip away the pretence that Parliament can achieve something that is not on offer while working within the EU system. I hope that having sketched the process for which we are bound, the Committee will see that we must not be just full of wishful thinking and believe that we can change things for our own benefit, because we have signed up to a legal system that will, in all probability, prevent that.</span></p>
<p>5.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few brief remarks, because I am pleased that the Minister has said that we will have further opportunities to debate the issue as the Commission's proposals firm up.<br><br>
Having examined the documents, I was struck by the European Scrutiny Committee's comment in paragraph 17.8 of its 13th report. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Like many similar communications, this document tends to be repetitive and couched in somewhat general and unfocussed terms, making it difficult in places to identify precisely what action is envisaged."</p></blockquote>
One problem about debating the future of the common fisheries policy, especially having heard the speech by the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton), is that the papers are immensely unfocused. Despite the welcome terminology, which talks about regional structures for the delivery of the management of a fishing policy, and other welcome statements in the Green Paper and other associated papers, a great deal more is needed to add flesh to the bones of what is broadly a pleasing document.<br><br>
In our previous sitting, we were able to question the Minister on the record about specific aspects of the Government's approach to the next stages of the negotiations. That was a welcome opportunity, but the debate that we need to have will largely have to be deferred until we receive the detail that we all want.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
The hon. Member for Congleton suggested that there was much speculation as to what we can and cannot do. I should like to see evidence of the way in which that will be developed. The primary issue is that the industry would welcome the continuation of relative stability for Britain. There is a settled will at least to retain the six and 12-mile limits and, if possible, to extend them and the role and responsibilities of sea fisheries committees to manage inshore.<br><br>
As the Minister knows, the Liberal Democrats were the first party to make a clear proposal for—[<i>Interruption.</i>] It was not for renegotiation. I do not know where the hon. Member for Congleton found her quote, but she will have dug it up from somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dug the quote out of a debate on 6 December. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not remember saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that the Minister will ensure not only that we get strong and effective renegotiation of the CFP, but that we have a clear UK strategy on where the industry is going and how it will get there."— <i>[Official Report,</i> 6 December 2001; Vol. 376, c. 527.]</p></blockquote>
From the hon. Gentleman's own lips did the good words fall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that I am guilty of using slack language, but the hon. Lady well knows that I did not intend my speech to be interpreted as it has been. I would never, of course, question the accuracy of the <i>Hansard</i> reporters, but whether or not my speech was recorded accurately, my intention at that stage in talking about common fisheries policy reform was to discover how we were taking the policy forward beyond 2002. If the hon. Lady wants to interpret my words in a certain way to satisfy a particular end, that is up to her.</span></p>
<p>5.52 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>6.07 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned I was raising the issue of regional management and addressing the misinterpretation of some words that I used. There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm to see regional management methods delivered in a future common fisheries policy. There are many opportunities where it would make a great deal of sense to engage the fishing industry in a shared approach to managing the stock. The principle of giving the industry some say in the way that stocks are managed must surely help us to get across the message that those stocks must be managed for the benefit of the industry as well as of the country as a whole. The industry will begin to recognise that with power comes responsibility: if it messes up the way that those stocks are managed, it will have to take some responsibility for it too. The industry rightly says that fishing suffers from too much politics. Perhaps we should establish a political system that enables fishermen to take greater control. We should work towards a devolved system of management, if we can achieve that with the support of other European countries. I am pleased that the Minister broadly agrees.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I clarify what the hon. Gentleman considers to be regional? I get the impression that he considers Cornwall as a region that could be used for this management. Yet the Green Paper refers to regions in a slightly difference context. It refers to the North sea as a region. That would require the involvement of a number of different countries. Paragraph 5.1 talks about regional councils being open to the participation of interested representatives and officials from other member states. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the accountability of the management of those blocks will be weakened by the involvement of representatives from other member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that question. It is clear in the Liberal Democrat party's policy papers and in statements in which we have been able to expand on the issue of regional management that that is not about regions. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that Cornwall is a region and should be seen as one. I consider it as one, although many people in Cornwall consider it to be a nation. For the purposes of fishing and the management of fish stocks, however, we cannot create artificial bureaucratic boundaries. Fish do not necessarily recognise the same boundaries as human beings do. They do not have the same sense of identity and nationality.<br><br>
Clearly, if fishing regions are being established, they must be based broadly on natural regions such as the North sea, the western approaches and the Irish sea. The important point is that the areas can be managed internationally. The hon. Gentleman is right to identify that many of the regional boards or regional management committees that I would like to be set up would inevitably have representation from all member states with a stakeholder interest in the proper and effective successful management of fish stocks in that fishing region.<br><br>
The Minister, in reply to an earlier question, clearly said that in most regions, including my region—the western approaches, or area 7 to give the larger area— that approach would inevitably result in interests from several other member states having to be represented. I want that to be explored. I hope that the Minister feels that he is going from Parliament and this country into the negotiations backed by a great deal of enthusiasm from the industry and from interested politicians, all seeking a successful outcome on the establishment of a devolved structure.<br><br>
I had no original intention of speaking for a long time on that matter and shall now simply highlight the other issues that I believe are important in future negotiations, including, as I mentioned in the questions, seeking a satisfactory outcome for the future of low-impact fishing methods. As the Minister well knows, mackerel hand liners have recently been accredited by the Marine Stewardship Council. That may be a good basis on which to define low-impact fishing methods, and to seek the agreement of other fishing nations that in some circumstances low-impact fishing methods could be taken out of the quota system altogether.<br><br>
I know that the Minister does not favour that, but it is worth exploring. It may encourage fishermen to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
decommission or to reduce capacity in other sectors, if they can see a means to withdraw from those sectors, but continue to be engaged in the fishing industry by pursuing an activity on which there are no or few restrictions, because we know that the method, so long as it is pursued properly, is low-impact. I earlier gave the example that a week from a purse seiner is the equivalent of a year from the whole fleet of mackerel hand liners in Cornwall. That underscores the significance of low-impact fishing methods.<br><br>
The Minister has not always been enthusiastic about multi-annual quotas or thought it appropriate to introduce them. He knows that I have pressed that issue because the industry continually complains about the problems of eleventh-hour brinkmanship and the way in which annual total allowable catches and quotas are decided. I hope that he will go into future negotiations seeking a clear indication of the direction in which quotas will be going not only over the next 12 months, but over 24 and 36-month periods. That would allow fishermen to inform their bank managers and others such as investors and owners of the exact direction in which the sector will be going over a long period of time on the basis of indicative quotas, rather than, as is often the case, informing them a month before the commencement of the next fishing year.<br><br>
I have made my points about the Shetland box, and I am pleased that the Minister will be pursuing the issue, which will be retained in the Green Paper.<br><br>
On enforcement, there are still major issues to be resolved, but I encourage the Minister to seek agreement between Britain and other member states to avoid a situation contained in one of the papers, which suggested a European-based inspectorate for the purposes of enforcement and the management of, for example, the multi-annual guidance programme. He knows that I have always felt that those issues should be resolved by member states through bilateral agreements. British inspectors could go and spot check other member states' inspectorates at their ports on an agreed number of occasions. That would provide the appropriate sanctions and methods of scrutiny to establish the kind of confidence that the industry in this country wants in the way in which fishing industries are monitored and legislation is enforced in those countries. I hope that that can be pursued.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) rightly pointed out that many of the papers, and much of the justification for European involvement in third-country agreements, are based on the economic self-interest either of Europe or its individual member states. It is important that we establish a basis by which that approach is compliant with Europe's development and international development objectives. That is not clear from the way in which the papers are written or the direction in which policy is going.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister is keen that more selective catch methods should be explored in the Green Paper, especially where technical measures can be introduced to avoid either other methods of effort control or capacity reduction that decreases or eliminates by-catches. The few months ahead will be challenging, and I hope that we shall have further opportunities to

debate the issues, particularly as we get further details from the Commission about what will be contained in the Green Paper.</span></p>
<p>6.18 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few comments about the economics of the fishing industry. Although my constituency includes coastline, Fareham has no fishing industry. There is, however, a small fishing fleet based in Portsmouth. Fareham employs its coastline for leisure users.<br><br>
The ironic aspect of the debate on fisheries is that in most industries in which the supply of goods is limited by law, those who exploit them tend to make profits, which is why they need to be regulated. It seems odd that fishermen do not make profits and the industry is relatively unprofitable.<br><br>
The snappily titled Council document, "7378/01" of 23 March sets out a table showing the ratio of net profits over invested capital in 1999. It shows 28 categories of return, and it is interesting to note that eight categories make returns of less than 0 per cent. In other words, they are loss making. Thirteen categories make returns of between 0 per cent. and 10 per cent. and the seven remaining categories make returns of more than 10 per cent. There is profitability in the sector, but the several categories in which losses are made or in which there are very low rates of return because of investment made in fishing boats, indicate, as the Minister said, that there is overcapacity in the sector. The Green Paper explicitly highlights that, and refers to itself as "a critique" of the current state of the common fisheries policy. It suggests ways in which we can move forward, but those suggestions are its weakness. Issues must be principally tackled among member states, and between them and the Commission.<br><br>
Overcapacity in the fishing sector reflects two issues. First, the Government have been reluctant to take fishing boats out of commission; the Minister referred to the decommissioning round that happened here, and there must be greater pressure on member states to decommission boats. The second is the issue of investment subsidy—the subsidy of construction for new boats. Such construction causes continuing overcapacity in the industry. People look for methods to get out to sea and they want to make a return on the money that they have borrowed, so they over-fish and begin fishing illegally. One can observe the chain of events from construction subsidies to the enforcement issues with which we must grapple at individual country level.<br><br>
There are other subsidies such as tax-free fuel. As costs are reduced and competition is encouraged between boats, boats that are not subsidised will seek subsidies from their national Governments, which creates disequilibrium in the relationship between subsidies, and the cycle is repeated. That is dangerous for business because it requires more taxpayer's money to keep the business afloat—an unintended pun. I referred to the 1.1 billion euros of taxpayers' money that is used to subsidise a fishing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
industry that generates a net income of about 9 billion euros. The Green Paper makes progress in identifying why that problem should be tackled, but, given the regional importance of the fishing industry, the question of how is more difficult. I got exceptionally wet one day last summer when I visited the two towns in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn). There one can see the dependence on the fishing industry and the seasonal tourist trade, particularly on a wet August afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very rare.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a native of the north-east, who has been on many summer holidays to Whitby and Scarborough, I would not use the words very rare to describe the climactic conditions of either seaside resort.<br><br>
We must identify a way in which we can reduce dependence on the fishing sector. There is a conflict within European Union rules because, although we have a common fisheries policy—the Green Paper makes that clear—the economic and industrial strategy that relates to the fishing sector is dealt with at the level of nation states. That conflict runs through many aspects discussed today such as enforcement, to which the hon. Member for St. Ives referred. A suggestion in the Green Paper is that we should move to more Community-enforceable sanctions, but I disagree because nation states should decide on appropriate sanctions for illegal fishing. Furthermore, there is the conflict of economics.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Congleton referred to the legal position of the common fisheries policy and the fact that it applies to national Governments. I am not sure that a Community-wide strategy is best. A regional system, such as that to which the hon. Member for St. Ives referred, could work with bilateral or multi-lateral arrangements between Governments. It is important to recognise that the regional bodies referred to in the Green Paper would be purely advisory and would not have the power to bind. If we are to make the process of setting fishing quotas more transparent, we must move decision-making closer to local level so that the fishermen off the north-east coast, Cornwall and so on can have a genuine say in what is happening and sit alongside the scientists so that they understand the environmental issues that must be taken into account when determining the level of quota. If decision-making is moved closer to those directly affected by the decisions many more people—crucially, those whose livelihoods are most affected—would better understand the reason for the quotas.<br><br>
I did not intend to say much when I came into the Room and I hope that I have not trespassed too much on the Committee's time. We cannot allow the common fisheries policy with its current impact at member state level to continue unchanged. I hope that the Government will use the Green Paper as a vehicle to push through radical changes to the policy in the interests of a viable fishing industry in the United Kingdom.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p>6.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate and some interesting and thoughtful comments have been made. We are considering the documents before us and much of the Committee's attention has, understandably and rightly, focused on the common fisheries policy and the forthcoming review. It is not often that we have a chance to address what we all agree are failings in the system. The Commission pulled no punches in the Green Paper and stated those failings. The challenge is to try to obtain agreement with other member states on the changes that we want post 2002. We want to retain much of the present policy because it is in our national interest. Relative stability and coastal limits are important. As I said to the hon. Member for Congleton, relative stability is an accepted and recognised part of the policy. Quota shares are also an established part of the policy and, as I said when answering questions on enlargement, they protect members of the European Union.<br><br>
There is an argument that we have not done as well in some aspects of our national quota as in others. We have done well with haddock with about 80 per cent. of the EU quota and with cod, but we have not done as well with Channel cod for which we have a small quota. However, overall, it is not in our national interest to disturb relative stability, nor is it in any other country's national interest. That is one of the issues that we shall discuss.<br><br>
There is much agreement among member states about important aspects of the common fisheries policy. If there is no agreement, matters such as relative stability will automatically roll over post 2002. The only issue on which there must be a decision is coastal limits, but that decision is made by a qualified majority voting and need not be unanimous. I am confident that a qualified majority will vote for us to retain our coastal limits, ideally for good. We shall argue that the United Kingdom's coastal limits should not be a derogation for the future but should be permanently classified as national coastal limits and there is support for that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Congleton referred to producer organisations and their responsibilities. They are responsible for managing quotas legally and properly. They know that, and my Department is in touch with them directly and through our sea fish inspectorate. If members of producer organisations break the rules, they face prosecution. We shall prosecute if they break the rules and they know that. It is important to give the industry an opportunity to manage its own affairs in a responsible way, and we expect it do that. However, it is not exempt from the law. We expect the producer organisations to operate in a proper manner: we check their returns and landing figures, and there is also an external check.<br><br>
The hon. Lady made a point about EU law. With regard to that subject, disagreements are often about differences of interpretation, and, on this matter, her interpretation is different from mine. I acknowledge that there are people in the fishing community who hold sincere views about the interpretation of EU law, and they are entitled to do so. I am not criticising them. However, with regard, for example, to the Corfu
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
permit system, as the hon. Lady rightly stated, the permit system is in operation in western waters, and that is not controversial within the fishing industry, as people understand the reasons for it.<br><br>
Moreover, a permit system can only be extended if the member states agree to that. It is not within the Commission's power to simply impose policies such as EU fishing permits on member states. That provides a safeguard for individual member states. We believe that national licensing is the best way forward—that it is right to devolve the management of such matters. I am not aware that the Commission is challenging that.<br><br>
I have heard many doom and gloom stories from people who have a different interpretation of EU law, about what will happen post 2002. However, although I do not claim to be infallible, my interpretation— which I have frequently defended—is shared by my officials, the Commission and its legal services, and member states. Therefore, on balance, I am on the safer side, with regard to interpretation of EU law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to that, time will tell: the Minister has only a few more months to sleep through before we discover which side is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot disagree with that. Time will tell, and I am reasonably confident that we will be able to ensure that we keep the main aspects of the common fisheries policy that are important to us. We also want to see some changes. It is inevitable that we will have to argue hard, particularly on the regional management issue, because there are different interpretations with regard to that. However, I believe that we can make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister recollects that, three or four years ago, the same doom and gloom merchants were anticipating that, by the time we got to the Green Paper, it would be impossible to retain relative stability and the coastal limits, and we were assured that there was no chance of them being retained beyond 2002?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. I read a report about a candidate for the European Parliament—in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, I think—who represented the UK Independence Party, and who was going around saying, "The Spanish are coming up to your doorsteps; they will be fishing right up to the beaches, and they will be in your fridge to steal your fish fingers as soon as 2002 is over." I do not believe that that will happen. It is not our intention that it should happen, and I do not believe that it is the intention of the majority of member states.<br><br>
The hon. Member for St. Ives broadly welcomed the Green Paper—as did the Government. We thought that it reflected many of the arguments that were proposed by the United Kingdom Government—and by the UK fishing industry, which was proactive. It did not sit back and wait for the end of the world as we know it; it produced a well-argued document that explained the kind of things that they wanted to see, with regard to reform of the common fisheries policy. It has influenced the Commission, and it is one of our challenges to effectively support some of its proposals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
I recognise that many producer organisations are trying to develop that element of regionalisation. The Cornish PO is one of them, and has had discussions with the Spanish fishing industry, as they have joint interests in hake fishery among other things. The Cornish PO is being proactive and deserves to be congratulated.<br><br>
I repeat my support for low-impact fisheries. I have always been a strong supporter of mackerel hand lines and, indeed, of our inshore sector. I am keen for us to bring the shellfish licence forward. The bulk of the UK fishing fleet is coastal and operates at under 10 m. Much of it works in shellfish fisheries and is doing well; returns have been quite good in the shellfish sector, which is fairly stable. I want to ensure that that stability remains. One way to do that is through a shellfish licensing scheme, because that way we can manage the present effort. If the present effort can be maintained against the present catch—they are roughly in line, but there is always a little movement—we will have a nice steady sustainable fishery with good economic returns. I am keen for that to happen, and recognise that those fisheries have a low impact on the environment.<br><br>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for St. Ives thought that I did not support multi-annual quotas. I am very keen on them. Perhaps he is referring to the fact that there are problems implementing them when stocks are low. Stocks need to be fairly robust as the idea behind the multi-annual quota is that we even out natural fluctuations in the stock over, say, three years. If stock is at rock bottom, it is difficult to apply a three-year quota. That is my reservation, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, as an objective, we want multi-annual quotas. The sooner we can implement them, the better. The Commission support that view.<br><br>
There are issues that we must tackle to ensure that there is a more uniform standard of enforcement and control. Like the hon. Gentleman, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to have an EU inspectorate. Enforcement is a member-state responsibility. However, I believe that the EU has a role in inspecting member states and making sure that they are meeting their enforcement and control obligations. I do not object to that. The Commission has a role to play in that respect, and does so.<br><br>
I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about third-country agreements. They have a role to play in the fishing industry. I do not want to be hypocritical; we have an interest in some third-country agreements. The Greenland agreement, for example, is of particular interest to our distant-water fleets. Nevertheless, there are legitimate concerns about the impact such agreements have on developing countries, their value for money and sustainability, and whether they are being managed properly. Those are perfectly reasonable concerns, and we shall raise them in the Council. We expect to have a discussion on third-country agreements this year, and will raise some of those points then.<br><br>
I welcome the comments made by the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) about the economics of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
fishing and the destructive effect that subsidies for capacity can have. The history of the subsidies is even worse. In the 1980s, grants were given to the fishing industry for modernisation, and for building and lengthening vessels. That had the effect identified by the hon. Gentleman. It caused unsustainable fishing, increasing capacity and reducing profits. Having spent much public money on modernisation in the 1980s, in the 1990s we spent public money on decommissioning those vessels. That is not rational and does not make sense. There are more meaningful ways to use our limited public funds to assist the fishing industry than through modernisation and new build. I am not alone in that view in the Council of Ministers, although it is not universally shared.<br><br>
Having made such an excellent speech, the hon. Member for Fareham spoiled it a bit by criticising the EU approach in fisheries management. There must be an overall EU approach, because, as the hon. Member for St. Ives says, fish do not recognise national boundaries. If one member state carries out unsustainable activities in one half of the North sea or of the English channel, that will inevitably impact on us, too. We must, therefore, have a pan-European management system for fish stocks. Even if we acknowledge, as I freely do, the failings and weaknesses of the CFP, we must have some kind of European fisheries management scheme. We must recognise the weaknesses of the CFP and, in the 2002 review, support the principles in the Green Paper, which we believe are right, and implement a new, revised CFP—although that is in itself unlikely to deliver in one go all the changes that we might want.<br><br>
The other challenge is to create a dynamic management regime that changes over time and reflects, for example, the need for input from the fishing industry, a more regional dimension and flexibility. I believe that that is possible and that we can progress. We are not without supporters of the UK view in the Council of Ministers, and we are not far from the Commission's view—not an uncomfortable position in which to be in relation to having its support.<br><br>
I do not underestimate the difficulties involved in the changes, and I do not believe that each member state will take the same view. That is the nature of democracy and national priorities, and we shall have to argue our corner. I appreciate the Committee's views, which help me as a Minister in dealing with the House's views, and I appreciate that generally speaking there is a broad consensus about the direction in which we want to go. That helps me in negotiating and progressing our national objectives through the Council of Ministers.</span></p>
