	<div class='legislation'>Sixth Environmental Action Programme</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>[Relevant Document: European Union Document No. 5771/01, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme of the European Community (2001–2010).]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Committee's view that the sixth community environmental action programme deals with a subject of major importance. I welcome the opportunity to discuss a document that will set out the framework for European Union policy on the environment for the next 10 years. It deals with some of the most pressing environmental issues facing this country at the beginning of the 21st century, such as climate change and the need for greater resource efficiency. Those wide problems equally face our European partners, and co-ordinated action will increase our effectiveness in dealing with them. Through the sixth environmental action programme, we are drawing up the shape that that action will take over the coming decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We supported the political agreement reached in Council on 7 June last year. That came before the Committee was able to convene for a second time to discuss the supplementary information that I provided in May. The political agreement that we reached reflected to a considerable extent the Government's negotiating objectives and was fully worthy of our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of reasons why the EU needs an environmental programme. Environmental problems do not respect national boundaries. Action at community level is best placed to deal with trans-boundary problems such as air and water pollution. Environmental problems are inter-linked, so a strategic, integrated approach is essential. Actions to deal with one issue will affect other areas. For example, improvements in resource efficiency will save resources, while reducing the waste that we produce and the energy that we consume. That, in turn, will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The programme gives us the overarching perspective that we need to deal collectively with those interconnected issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is a general action programme, not a technical document. Accordingly, a feature of the programme is the flexibility that it allows for future policy making. The programme establishes concrete targets for action where current analysis is sufficient to enable action. The current text does what a general action programme should: it presents a strategic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
document with a sense of prioritisation, focuses on a key set of objectives, and allows appropriate flexibility for future policies to achieve the objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme sets out its objectives under the four central themes identified in the global assessment of the fifth environment action programme. That gives the sixth programme a high degree of strategic focus. The four central areas are climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment and health and quality of life, and sustainable use of natural resources and the management of waste. Climate change is emphasised as
	<br><q><p>"an outstanding challenge of the next 10 years and beyond."</p></q>
The overall aim includes decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth. Those are priorities for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As highlighted in the explanatory memorandums and the regulatory impact assessment, the programme will not have a direct regulatory impact. It will provide a basis for future proposals from the Commission to meet its objectives. Let me emphasise that, although the sixth environmental action programme is about taking action at Community level, it should not simply lead to a flood of new proposals for legislation from the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, a number of commitments and targets. Some are quantitative, where sufficient analysis has already been carried out. In other cases, targets are more qualitative. There is a commitment to set numerical targets later, when appropriate analysis has been completed—for example, on waste minimisation and in the thematic strategies. The means to achieve those targets will be developed against the programme's commitment to an improved approach to policy making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that environmental policy is better made in future, there is a clear commitment to focus on the environmental outcomes to be achieved by employing the most effective and appropriate means available. That may entail a combination of instruments. Some of the programme's more complex ambitions—for example, promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns—clearly require a blend of measures, which may include market-based instruments and voluntary commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission will develop policy in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, considering the full range of available options. It will emphasise benefits and costs and evaluate any measure's likely impact on the environment. Environmental policies will be reviewed and updated in the light of experience, and the programme will ensure a better link between EU environmental policy and the Community research programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the measures that will flow from the programme will be seven thematic strategies, which will deal with particularly complex issues such as waste recycling and resource management, where much further analysis is needed, as well as a co-ordinated approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key problem facing the environment in Europe is insufficient attention to implementation and enforcement across the Community once measures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
have been agreed. The programme will seek to address that. Overall, the common position amounts to a stretching but realistic programme that represents a substantial improvement on the original Commission proposal. I look forward to hearing Committee members' comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite hon. Members to put questions to the Minister until 11.30 am or until questions are exhausted. We will then move on to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend inform me about some general issues? Matters such as carbon dioxide emission are European and worldwide problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will my right hon. Friend comment not only on wind and solar energy, but on wave and tidal energy? Is that in the equation? Secondly, will he say something about genetically modified organisms? As he knows, there is a wide diversity of views on that issue. Will the framework address it? Thirdly, will he explain the approach that will be taken to major health problems? Will some, such as cancer, mental health and heart disease, be prioritised, as in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made three wide-ranging points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On wave and tidal energy, I repeat that this is a framework document, not a technical document, and it does not specifically deal with that subject. It covers the key overarching objectives, perhaps the biggest of which is climate change. At Kyoto, the EU committed itself to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, as measured in 1990, by 8 per cent, by 2010. A burden-sharing agreement was reached under the UK presidency in 1998, and we have made a commitment to reduce emissions by 12.5 per cent. The means by which those objectives are achieved are left to individual countries. They include wave and tidal energy and I am the first to accept that the potential in the United Kingdom is greater than we have yet tapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
GMOs are probably the most contentious issue in my portfolio. The health issue and alleged environmental impact are covered by the framework document. A common position has been agreed with the European Parliament for revision of directive 92/20 with a new directive 2010/18, which comes into force on 17 October. It contains a range of new measures to tighten the regulation of GMOs. We shall pursue issues such as the experience of member states in implementing that directive, the question of political accountability, reduction of the polarisation of views in all member states, and, in particular, the vexed issue of the so-called—I choose my words delicately—informal moratorium on approvals, which came into force in 1998 following the action of six member states. The United Kingdom does not support that moratorium on the grounds that that is not the way to approach the issue and that approvals should be given when they are justified. However, the labelling and traceability provisions should be in place when we consider those approvals and should be one of the conditions for giving approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The relationship between environment and health is close. Many health issues are affected by environmental issues—for example, landfill, hazardous waste and air pollution. One of the most alarming discoveries of recent research is that some air pollution is much more drastic for health—for example, particulates and to some extent nitrous oxide—than we had believed. The causes, which include transport emissions and some industrial emissions, must be addressed. All are covered, but there will undoubtedly be further technical proposals from the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statistics on page 50 of the communication are helpful. World population between 1950 and 1997 increased from 2.5 billion to 5.8 billion, and the number of mega-cities—cities with a population of more than 8 million—increased from two in 1950 to a staggering 25 in 1997. The number is probably greater now. Does the Minister agree that the greatest single problem facing the world is overpopulation and the growth of population? What do the documents say about population control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the rapid rise in population is serious. The carrying capacity of the earth and its resources became an issue only during the last century, and it is an issue not just for the state of human civilisation, but possibly for human survival. The exponential increase in the population during the last century cannot continue indefinitely. The population at the beginning of the last century was 3 or 4 billion, but it has increased to 6 billion and is expected to rise to 9 billion by 2050. The human race has been present on earth for around quarter of a million years and the population in the course of recorded history was stable until the last century, so the change is dramatic. The document does not directly address overpopulation but seeks to deal with its consequences. It is not for a framework document for environmental action to deal with population, but I agree that we should deal not only with the symptoms, but the causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue extends beyond the European Union. The greatest increases in population are in developing countries; the population in developed countries is largely stable. Population is increasing rapidly in Africa in particular, and in south-east Asia and Latin America. I agree that we need international discussion to assist in dealing with that. Powerful religious scruples and inhibitions exist, especially on contraception, but there is increasing worldwide recognition that population increase cannot continue at the present rate and that family planning must be considered in some developing countries. Of course, that cannot be enforced and can be done only by voluntary agreement. The pressure on environmental resources and public services is so great that we cannot indefinitely ignore the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend extend his comments on waste management to landfill sites? During the foot and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
mouth outbreak, there were problems and worries about pollution of water and grazing land. Will that be part of the Environment Agency's concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is part of the Environment Agency's concerns. There was a requirement to move the carcasses of the 3 to 4 million animals that were killed in the course of the foot and mouth outbreak. They were disposed of by a variety of methods that included incineration, and disposal on site and in large registered landfill sites. The issue is covered generally by the framework document, and waste control and management is one of the biggest unresolved environmental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not succeeded in this country, or in any other country, in decoupling growth, which we all want, from its environmental consequences. In this country, the increase in waste is roughly in proportion with the rise in growth, roughly 3 per cent., and possibly more. Our objective must be to ensure that we retain growth, which is not a politically contentious issue, while reducing waste arising to zero, and then to a negative rate, which would mean less waste in the next year than in the present year. The Commission will return to that area in future documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to my hon. Friend's specific question, I know that many concerns were expressed in his constituency because mine adjoins his. There was worry that landfilling carcases could have an impact on those sites, particularly through leaching into the water supply. To my knowledge, the Environment Agency has investigated all those cases and ensured that that did not happen. Unless he has specific evidence to the contrary, which I would be glad to know about, that has not led to any adverse long-term environmental consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of his introductory remarks, the Minister touched on implementation and enforcement. How will the EU ensure that all member states meet the targets in the document? If they do not, what penalties might apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document places much more emphasis on the fact that we do not want an endless train of new provisions, and the UK was at the forefront in pressing for the requirement that provisions be fully justified and properly costed. We do, however, want better implementation and enforcement of measures that are already in place. The UK is rightly scrupulous in implementing measures from Brussels, but it is alleged—not by me, as I am not familiar with the evidence—that that is not always true of other member states. I repeat that that is an allegation. It is therefore right that the Commission should place greater emphasis on implementation and enforcement, which is a central requirement under the framework directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how the process will be carried through, and it is clear that the Commission will seek more direct evidence on enforcement. Of course, enforcement within their own boundaries is a matter for national Governments, but the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Commission has a right to demand information showing that rigorously assessed inventories of action have been taken. The Commission will ask for more of those, not because it wants to be more bureaucratic, but simply to ensure that EU decisions are being implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On sanctions, such matters are written into each of the technical documents that require action to be taken on a particular aspect of environmental policy. Each measure should contain a sanction, which it is the Commission's responsibility to exact. If there is evidence of a failure to implement, or prima facie evidence that another state is failing to implement, which might have competitive consequences for industry, it must be provided by the complainant body or country. The Commission is expected fully to investigate, and to publish its conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend comment on nuclear waste and, in particular, on disagreements between the Republic of Ireland and our country over the issues on which he has touched?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over radioactive waste?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The level of radioactive discharges in the Irish sea remains a serious bone of contention between the UK and Irish Governments. Compared with levels in the 1960s and 1970s, the discharge has unquestionably been substantially reduced, particularly through the manufacture and operation of the enhanced actinide removal plant. Although I am no technician, I know that EARP removes radio nuclides from the process and disposes of them on site, so that their discharge in the Irish sea is not required. The one exception is technetium 99, which remains a source of complaint for the Irish Government and for each of the Scandinavian Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technetium 99 is a radio nuclide that persists in the environment for about 213,000 years. That is just about the length of time that hominids and homo sapiens have been roaming the planet; it is a long time. It is not radiologically highly significant, and none of the parties claims it to be, but it has been discovered off the Irish coast and off the coast of Scandinavia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is to reduce those technetium 99 discharges. The levels have been reduced from the levels reached in the 1990s. In 1994,I think that the discharge level was 10 becquerels. I always get mixed up about the units, and it might be terabecquerels. But whatever the appropriate unit, the discharge level was increased from 1994, in order to remove the level in the five tanks that store it at Sellafield, to 200 of whatever the units are. It has now been reduced again—I am not sure whether by the present or by the previous Government—to 90. We are committed to reducing it to 10 again as quickly as we can. The problem is the technology that will deliver that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Environment Agency has been in extensive discussions with Sellafield and British Nuclear Fuels about the matter. I have put in place an examination of the level of radionuclides at Sellafield and other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
nuclear plants in this country. I have asked the Environment Agency to carry out a thorough investigation of each, but to give priority to technetium 99 because of the international concerns. It has presented its decision, and that is now in the public domain and being examined closely by the Irish Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the technology that would deliver a rapid reduction to a discharge level of 10 units is simply not available. I am keen that any technology that will deliver that, which the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive will support, should be put in place as fast as possible. The agency has proposed that, at the very latest, discharge levels will reduce to 10 by 2006. If that could happen earlier, I would be the first to support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other problem that arises is that, until 2006, the material continues to be stored in the five tanks. The HSE is constantly examining the integrity of those tanks and, of course, we would have to take action if it should find any risk to their integrity. That is not the case at the moment, nor is it believed likely before 2006. If the discharge continues at 90 units a year, all those tanks will be discharged by 2006. However, I repeat that if we could find the technology to do that earlier, and without discharge to the Irish sea, the British Government would strongly support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised at the Minister's answer to the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) regarding leachate in watercourses and pipes. May I suggest that he asks his Department to contact Northumbrian Water? It actually had to move a main water pipe because there was a danger of leachate coming from piles of carcases into a main drinking water pipe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question asked by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) was very important. The implementation of directives has, to put it at its most generous, been patchy. We believe that this country has a good record, and are pretty clear that other countries have not always had the same record, especially when they have thought implementation to be against their commercial interests or where strong political interests have delayed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often, the implementation of directives is self-regulating. The document clearly states that the legal process has been slow and cumbersome in enforcing directives. It proposes a name, shame and fame system, which we welcome. However, it does not propose an auditing process for the implementation of directives. Are the Government minded to press the EU for an effective auditing of the implementation of directives, so that we can ensure that everyone in the EU has to face up to the same responsibilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first question, I was not suggesting that there have not been problems with regard to leachate. I simply said that, to my knowledge, the Environment Agency took the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
necessary action to ensure that water supplies were not threatened. I accept the example that the hon. Gentleman cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his main question about implementation and delays, the hon. Gentleman raised the interesting issue of an auditing process. The Commission can carry out an auditing process only by asking for information from national Governments about the state of progress according to target dates on the implementation of directives. That is what the framework document commits the Commission to do. Whatever phrase one uses, closer attention to implementation is now in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Mandelkern—not Mandelson—group of high-level experts published a report last November in which it suggested that a new comprehensive impact assessment covering all Commission regulatory proposals should be in place by June. That will help with the manner in which implications, costs and delivery mechanisms are assessed. In the light of that, I expect the Commission to give much closer attention to demanding more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be one of those who, if we go too far in that direction, will complain that the Commission and the EU are being buried under bureaucracy. We must make a trade-off between getting the necessary extra information to check on the speed and adequacy of implementation—the hon. Gentleman made a valid point about that—without going so far that officials are increasingly simply filling in pieces of paper. A closer auditing process is certainly one of the fruits of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Janet Dean 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the document propose a greater emphasis on the re-use, rather than recycling, of materials? Obviously recycling is important, but if we try to create less waste—glass bottles, for example—there would be less need for it. We need to change our approach to that issue in this country and throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The EU position on waste management has largely focused on two areas. First, we must reduce landfill. In the UK in recent years, household and municipal waste has been about 85 per cent, landfill. We have to reduce that to no more than 35 per cent, of 1995 levels, which is huge reduction given that we have the highest landfilling rate of any of the member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect is incineration. I am the first, but probably not the last, person to mention that this morning. The standards that must be met on discharge levels of incinerators were substantially tightened through a directive that came into operation on 1 October 1996, which was extremely welcome. There has been relatively little on recycling, reuse and recovery as such. As more information becomes available about waste practices and the loop is closed to ensure that the waste products of one process are put into another process, I have no doubt that the Commission will return to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
My hon. Friend was right to say that recycling was not the only relevant issue. The ultimate aim is to avoid the creation of waste in the first place, or to reduce the amount of waste as far as possible. Below waste minimisation, the next requirement in the waste hierarchy is recycling, reuse and recovery, as opposed to just recycling. She rightly referred to glassware. It amazed me that one use of cullet—broken glass—is as a base for road construction, obviously with layers of different quality above it. In small, gritty chunks, cullet can provide something of the suspension requirement for roads. As we improve our capacity for waste management, there must be myriad ways to use waste products of one process for another process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is tyres. A directive requires that there be no landfilling of tyres from 2003 or of shredded tyres from 2006. The question is what happens to those tyres. They must not be landfilled, and we all agree that they should not be fly-tipped, so we must find out the best environmental use for tyres. That issue relates to reuse and recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom Government have tried to deal with the problem by setting up WRAP, a lovely Whitehall acronym that stands for Waste Resources Action Programme. It is designed to establish markets for used products, and to advise local authorities about the markets that they will be able to use if they can increase recycling, reuse and recovery. The subject is large, and there is no question but that it will substantially expand in terms of recycling, reuse and recovery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three points, one of which is about the issue of redundant tyres to which the Minister referred. I have an illegal tyre dump in my constituency, and I want to ask him how much progress is being made towards ensuring that we achieve the landfill target dates of 2003 for whole tyre disposal and 2006 for shredded tyre disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what is the Minister's view of the different approaches taken by member states to nuclear power? Our approach is extremely different from that of France. Is that too hot a political potato for the European Union to juggle with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point returns to improvements in implementation. The Minister was diplomatic and referred only to allegations of failure to implement EU environmental legislation. However, I suspect from what he subsequently said that he accepts that that approach needs to change. The name, shame and fame approach will clearly involve the exposure of member states for failure to implement. What is the current situation? Is it true that neither the Commission nor anyone else publishes information that would tell EU citizens which member states are failing to implement environmental legislation? Must we rely instead on allegations of non-compliance, as the Minister suggests? That is wholly unsatisfactory. Although the new document will address that problem, can it not be addressed now? Existing legislation still needs to be implemented; what is the Commission doing to ensure that that happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's first question was about tyres. We are dealing with a directive, and it is a statutory requirement that those target dates of 2003 and 2006 should be met. It is not optional. All member states will be subject to sanctions if they fail. The UK will certainly meet those targets, as we have in all other cases. However, I appreciate that it is not an easy problem. If tyres are not to be used as landfill, what else can be done with them? Shredded tyres can be used as a base in certain forms of construction, and they can be used in cement kilns or incinerator plants as a form of fuel, along with other unusual materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the technical experience to make a judgment, but I know that strong views have been expressed about the environmental impact of the burning of tyres and other such fuels, particularly on local communities. The Environment Agency is acutely aware of that, and I am seeking more detailed information about that impact. It remains a problem, but we shall certainly meet our targets. I am sure that the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) will be keeping an eye on whether other member states do as well as we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On nuclear power, there is a difference between Britain and France. We remain the only two states in the EU with nuclear military hardware. However, there is a difference in our use of nuclear energy as a source for electricity. France obtains something like 70 per cent, of its electricity from nuclear plants. The figure for the UK is about 27 per cent., but that percentage will reduce over the next 11 years to 2012 as a result of the gradual closure of the Magnox plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is now being debated in the press, in light of the performance and innovation unit report, which has, over the past few months, carried out a review of our energy policies. I am one of the members of the ministerial advisory board. If the Prime Minister is so minded, the report will be published in the near future. The nuclear question is one of the matters addressed in that report. For instance, it asks whether there should be new nuclear build, and whether there should be a greater or lesser shift from conventional sources of energy, including nuclear, towards sustainable sources, particularly wind, solar, biomass, tidal and wave power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of sustainable sources is inevitable, and all member states will make such a shift. The question is how far and how fast. Companies such as BP and Shell, who are motivated by the need to make a return in the market, believe that as much as 50 per cent, of their production will be concerned with sustainable sources of energy by 2050. That is the way that the market is going worldwide, and it is important that we should be in the forefront, and not lagging behind. However, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) should wait for the report to be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire made an interesting point about naming and shaming. I shall tell him a secret: I have been keen to name and shame in several areas in the environment portfolio, but my officials are always cautious because such a process may seem unfair. There are often mitigating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
circumstances, or attempts to comply may have been made but blocked by factors beyond a company's control. There are always extenuating circumstances, and it is difficult to consider damaging the reputation of a company or a country unless one has taken full account of all the circumstances. One must make whatever qualifying statement is necessary so as not gratuitously to damage brand image, which is an important aspect in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I believe that there is justification in going further in this direction. We must ensure that accurate and comprehensive information is available—that is the only constraint. "Naming and shaming" is a colourful phrase, which only means that citizens in the United Kingdom and European Union are entitled to know about the performance of a company or country in meeting a target. It is a matter of public entitlement to know, which is perfectly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the Commission should be prepared to publish that information. It will be cautious about doing so, for the reasons that I have given, but we should consider the possibility further. Subject to any necessary qualifications, extending that information to all EU citizens would be partly a matter of citizens' entitlement and partly a powerful incentive for companies and countries to comply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to the regulatory impact assessment in the pack of data that I received before Christmas, which relates to a couple of points that hon. Members have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that costs are imposed on business without our fully thinking through measures suggested by the European Union. The deadlines required to be met for whole tyres and shredded tyres have been mentioned. We do not know how those tyres will be disposed of or how much those measures will cost business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire has spoken in the House many times about the disposal of fridges, and he will have another opportunity this afternoon to question the Prime Minister on that subject. That provides us with a clear example of a directive that has been implemented without our knowing exactly how it will be dealt with in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 9 of the regulatory impact assessment refers to recycling measures, which are
	<br><q><p>"likely to create extra costs for local authorities."</p></q>
It adds:
	<br><q><p>"The extension of producer responsibility measures is likely to involve additional costs."</p></q>
Will the Minister assure us that the Government will push the EU to ensure that any new directives on recycling are properly costed before they are put in place? Will he also assure us that we will be told what measures will be introduced to eliminate the issue of what will be done with tyres after 2003?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, which should be answered by the process currently employed. By the time the Commission makes a proposal, extensive lobbying has already
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
taken place in Brussels both by UKREP, the United Kingdom representation, and by companies. All major companies have liaison representatives in Brussels, because they know the importance of the legislation that comes from there. Therefore, such measures are not produced out of the blue. I would expect any alert company—and a non-alert company will not survive long in the market—to seek details and put its views strongly to the Commission about the viability of a proposal, and to suggest alternatives to meet particular problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when a measure has been introduced, it must go through the working groups in Brussels, which is an exhaustive and rigorous exercise. Key officials, who are of high rank and take instructions from the Governments of member states, will exhaustively press their points. The process will depend on liaison with industry. All Governments regard the purpose of making representations in Brussels as being the protection of their industries. Perhaps they do so more than they should, but that is how they see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the matter comes to the Council of Ministers. Most of the problems have been cleared away. There will be some outstanding issues and the role of Ministers—a role that I have taken many times—is to resolve them. Where one's own industry is threatened unreasonably, where the time scales are too short and the requirements will lead to closures or severe impacts that are considered unreasonable or unfair, it is for Ministers to negotiate, because in the end matters have to be settled by all member states, although qualified majority voting does operate on environmental matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, other countries are suffering from similar problems. If the pressures are too great, one can in nearly all cases find enough countries to block a measure if need be. There is a good atmosphere in the Council of Ministers, of which I have been a member for nearly five years. There is an understanding that in reaching the environmental acquis, we should have genuine regard for real problems. If a Minister can make a case convincingly, other member states will provide either a derogation or some reconsideration to assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impacts on business should be taken into account in all those ways when matters such as the target dates for tyres are considered. The hon. Gentleman made the point that one should not pass a directive—which, after all, is a law—until everyone is aware of how it will be implemented. I accept that to a degree. However, the concept of technology forcing is important. One gives industry a time scale within which it is believed that a certain technology can be developed to meet a certain requirement. It is a matter of judgment as to whether the time scale will be long enough and whether the development is practicable. I believe that it often is. A classic example comes from California, where only cars with no emissions or low emissions are to be allowed to use the roads after a certain point. Manufacturers must produce at least 10
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
per cent, of their cars to meet those targets by 2005, otherwise, their cars will not be allowed to use the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a compelling example, and the United States, or at least the state of California, was prepared to put it into operation. There is a real argument for technology forcing. The period for development should not be so tight as to be impractical—the time scale should be long enough for industry to meet the requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned fridges, and I am sure that the Prime Minister will be glad to know that he will be asked a question on that topic this afternoon. The fridge issue is slightly different. There is a requirement to remove ozone-depleting substances from all equipment, including fridges. That was agreed in 1999. There was no mandatory requirement to remove ozone-depleting substances from the foam. It remained a matter of doubt as to whether that was the case. The UK was convinced that the terminology did not require it, but in order to be certain we asked the Commission about the matter at the end of 1999 or in early 2000. We repeatedly pressed for an answer, but did not receive a final answer until July 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to all our expectations and beliefs, the answer was that ozone-depleting substances had to be removed from the foam. We have, therefore, put in place measures to deal with the matter as rapidly as possible in compliance with the EU regulation. The Commission let us down over the time that it took to deliver an effective answer. I shall not comment on its final conclusion, although we have our own views. However, it would have been easier for us to comply had we known the Commission's views a great deal earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technology is available in some member states, and we expect the first plant in this country to be operational this month. We know that several businesses are looking to supply plant in the spring, and we have clarified the technical standards that it must meet. We have told local authorities of their duties on matters such as storage at amenity sites. We have also provided funding until at least the end of the current financial year, and we are urgently considering what future requirements they may have. We are also studying how to put in place conditions to restore retailer take-back. We are, therefore, trying to deal with the matter as rapidly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's final point was on producer responsibility, which could apply to fridges. There is no question but that producer responsibility must be carefully costed. That is not simply a matter for the Government; it is for the industry to say what it can and cannot do. Some industries and companies are not as fast in that regard as they should be, and the best example of that is end-of-life vehicles. Much to my surprise, car companies in the UK and across Europe did not alert themselves quickly enough to the implications of that issue. That lesson has now been well learned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said that we had made a significant contribution to the programme.

In many cases, we change the form of decisions that are issued in directions and regulations, but once something is agreed, we will comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same painstaking and thorough process is not used in other cases, and the Commission has said that it will pay more attention to that overarching issue. We want a similar process to be implemented across the whole Community. Clearly, new acceding states—they will take us from 15 to 25 member states—will need some time to reach the required standards of implementation, and there may be a transitional period. The same standards must, however, apply across the whole Community. One cannot simply rely on the culture that exists in one member state, and the framework document will assist that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the comparative rates of duty on aviation fuel and vehicle fuel? Does the Minister agree that if aviation fuel is less heavily taxed, it is being subsidised by the more sophisticated nations at the cost of environmental pollution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks a question to which he already knows the answer, but I shall repeat for him and the Committee that there is a high rate of tax on petrol and diesel for cars—so high that it can, as we have seen, produce political responses— but a decision was made in the 1950s to assist the civil aviation industry by imposing no tax on aviation fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aviation has considerable environmental consequences with respect to climate change—we believe that carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft probably account for 5 or 6 per cent, of the world's greenhouse gas emission production, and that is growing fast. We accept that some means of limiting that is necessary. Such a means could be a tax on aviation fuel or an emission permit trading scheme, but it is illogical—and if this is the hon. Gentleman's point he is right—to impose high taxation on cars and a nil rate on aviation. That must change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the proper forum for investigating the question is the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which has been examining it for several years. It is deadlocked because the Americans and others are simply unwilling to agree to a tax on aviation fuel. It is proposed that if no decision should be reached by the end of 2002, action should be taken in another forum. The Government support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the European Union's sixth environmental action programme and the proposals included in it. Here, the lack of major environmental improvement is a clear example of what happens when there is a failure of coherent political will. I absolve the Minister from that criticism, because I have no doubt about his green credentials, though at the risk of embarrassing him yet again, I note with regret that others are not listening to him as avidly as we have been this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are ever ready with green words and the parroting of good intentions, but when it comes to action they demonstrate incoherence, as they did with domestic waste; incompetence, as they did with fridges; or indolence, as they did with flooding. Sometimes they have shown all three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth environmental action programme highlights the need to align economic growth and environmental progress. It focuses on
	<br><q><p>"areas where more action is needed and new European initiatives will make a difference".</p></q>
It goes on to state:
	<br><q><p>"We particularly need to encourage business to go further, on a voluntary basis and through legislation. Increased attention to environmental measures will improve efficiency and productivity. The expanding market for green goods will lead to increased innovation and expanded job opportunities. European businesses will prosper in this expanding market."</p></q>
The recognition that people need jobs and that private businesses provide them is one that more people here should heed, because companies have been consistently penalised by the Government in their interpretation of environmental targets. The willingness of the Government to interpret directives damagingly and embellish them needlessly has increasingly put this country at a competitive disadvantage. The action programme proposes management by results and we welcome that, because Governments cannot run businesses. It is far better that, rather than meddling in the detail, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Government determine the direction and let companies get on with the implementation in the way that best suits them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservatives believe that caring for the environment must be approached by educating people and instilling collective responsibility. Governments must work with all people: those who manage our countryside, business people who produce our wealth and every householder whom we serve. We should align people's best interests with their self-interest. That view is mirrored in this programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plans to encourage more businesses to assess their environmental performance and to help them to understand European Union rules are to be welcomed, because that meets with the Conservative belief that, first, businesses should be aware of their own performance, and then they should be allowed to evaluate how they might improve that performance, rather than being stifled with unnecessary bureaucracy and crippling costs, often imposed without consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservatism and conservation go together. My party is passionate about preserving the UK's natural heritage and the future of our planet. The four priorities of the action programme are the obvious starting points: tackling climate change; protecting nature and wildlife; addressing environment and health issues; and finally, preserving natural resources and managing waste. However, to do it effectively in a way that encourages corporate involvement and individual support will require politicians to deny themselves the luxury of micro-management and damaging taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time for politicians throughout Europe to lift their horizons. If we fail to act now on issues such as climate change and appropriate waste management, we risk bequeathing a poisoned legacy to our children. One way to conserve our resources is to harness new technology. Renewable energy will play a greater role in all our lives in the years to come. With the right incentives, more households will transform the way in which they power their homes by embracing this new technology. With the right approach from Government, energy companies will seize these opportunities, and in doing so they will be tapping into a major growth market for British enterprise and British jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain has the capacity to generate 30 per cent, of all the renewable energy needs of the European Union. It is a matter of regret and, I believe, shame that at present only 3 per cent, of our energy consumption comes from renewables. Promoting renewable energy should be a key component of the UK's overall strategy for combating climate change. It also happens to be a policy area in which disappointment with the Government is at its most intense. The Science and Technology Committee report on wind and tidal energy finds that
	<br><q><p>"for many years, the DTI has stated its belief that wave and tidal energy technologies are ten years away from viability."</p></q>
One witness described that statement as a "negative self-fulfilling prophecy". In the past, the Conservative party has been supportive of the Government's target
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
that 10 per cent, of our electricity should be generated from renewable sources by 2010. With recent dramatic improvements in the technology surrounding renewable energies, Conservatives believe that the current target is now overly modest and would like to see an appropriate increase. What are the Government's expectations beyond 2010? Will they consider extending the target to ensure that 30 per cent, of all electricity should be generated from renewable sources? When will the PIU report be completed and will its findings be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action programme proposes a strategy for Europe as a whole and Conservatives recognise that our responsibilities do not stop at home. We believe that we must be supportive of those countries that are candidates to join the EU in meeting their environmental obligations. The action programme report notes that those countries have environmental problems and that the key will be the effective and swift implementation of European environmental laws. We agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting legislation into practice effectively is one of the problems addressed by the action programme, a matter that was subject to close questioning this morning. The report admits that the legal process is still slow and cumbersome and years may pass before it brings results. Other methods can effectively speed up the process. It states that transparency, by making information widely available, helps to create public pressure for a rapid response and embarrasses laggards by highlighting how they are not delivering their commitments to our future. I welcome that admission wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union proposes first to monitor how European laws are applied and compile a regularly updated scoreboard, and secondly to implement a name, shame and fame exercise that will publicise the success and failure of different national Governments, which I welcome. I also hope that it will discourage the gold-plating of EU regulations, a trait so commonly displayed by successive UK Governments, and yet simultaneously ensure that the UK follows a coherent and effective environmental strategy that will ensure that targets are met. I especially agree that success rates should be regularly monitored throughout the European Union, but I want to know how swiftly penalties for non-compliance would be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The action programme focuses on another key issue: waste management. England and Wales alone produce about 400 million tonnes of waste every year. Conservatives have long called for a focus on waste minimisation, as landfill cannot be the principal answer to disposal, and incineration is no easy substitute. The only answer is far less waste, much more recovery and recycling and a Government who talk less and act faster—a view echoed by the action programme. Its approach to waste management is to prioritise waste prevention, followed by recycling, waste recovery and incineration, with landfill as a last
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
resort. The target is to reduce the quantity of waste going to final disposal by around 20 per cent, on 2000 levels by 2010 and by about 50 per cent, by 2050.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "sustainable development" has limited appeal. However, when it is put in the context of everyday experience, and people can do something close to home, sustainability will meet with success. That is why the Conservatives' recycling policy is significantly greener and more radical than any other party's. For some time, we have proposed a target of 50 per cent, of household waste being recycled or composted by 2020, which is significantly higher than the Government's target. That is why we said we would introduce doorstep recycling for all households; I wish that the Government would match that, as the alternative is a dirtier Britain and fines of up to £500,000 a day if EU rules on landfill sites are not met by 2010.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Belatedly, the Secretary of State announced a consultation paper on how to spend the £140 million that the Government allocated to local authorities to promote recycling, but I want the Minister to tell me whether that money will be available in time for us to meet our recycling obligations and avoid harsh EU-imposed penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the implementation of the EU action programme, which aims to ensure that the polluter pays, that people are able to make environmentally friendly choices, that waste is kept to a minimum and that all countries are aware of and meet their environmental obligations. The action programme clearly demonstrates, probably for the first time, that there is an intention to listen to business. With the accession of so many more countries, perhaps this represents a view of the new Europe. It certainly demonstrates a new realism, and the old Conservative party supports it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the paper, but only as far as it goes. It is a missed opportunity. It includes few targets, and the Minister was at pains to say that it was not a technical document. He claimed some of the credit for the UK Government for pushing for some of the targets that were included. Will he confirm, in relation to article 3, paragraph 4 on encouraging reforms of subsidies that have considerable negative effects on the environment, that there was a move to establish targets of an inventory of environmentally negative subsidies by 2002, and elimination by 2005? The Government resisted that, and I would welcome an explanation of why that was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the issue of implementation and enforcement, which was raised frequently in questions. The Minister said regularly that the Commission would be able to ask for information from member states, and pointed out that the document was not a technical one in relation to which sanctions might apply. However, the document does contain targets, so what sanctions will apply to ensure that the targets contained in the document are met? What sanctions will apply if member states do not provide the information? He has always said that the Commission
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
will ask for the information, but how can the Commission ensure that that information is available and made accessible to the public? After all, the impact on individual states' electorates in terms of knowing information that their Governments might not want to be in the public domain is the most potent weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents also demonstrate welcome moves by Europe to accept parts of the Kyoto agreement. Clearly, the United States has moved away from adopting Kyoto. What moves will the UK Government and the European Union take to ensure that the United States comes on board? Kyoto becomes just an aspiration in terms of the long-term impact on climate change if the United States is not part of it. We have great concerns that, although it sounds very good and welcome, it is only a small step if the United States is not helping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by the Conservatives' conversion to the cause of the environment, and delighted that they want to push targets even higher. I welcome the fact that they seem to be moving towards strengthening EU enforcement procedures, which is not what I would have expected to hear. It is welcome, and it probably means that all three of the major parties are united on the principle. We wait to see the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the document, there is a great danger that the action programme will be heralded as a major step forward. Without proper enforcement, without as many targets as there should have been, and without clear audited steps towards achieving those targets, however, the reality is that the programme will end up as fine words and, sadly, it will fail on delivery. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that that is not the case, and that it will lead to a considerable change in Europe on tackling environmental issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave a warm welcome to the Commission's programme. The Commission takes credit for progress but then says that more must be done. As the programme admits, rather than a coherent policy, it has a thematic strategy, which is significantly less positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should re-examine some of the statistics on page 50 of the communication. Water use has increased from 1.3 billion tonnes to 4.2 billion tonnes, and the document says:
	<br><q><p>"Demand for freshwater is now often above the rate of replenishment in many parts of the world. Similarly, many areas are suffering desertification, deforestation, and the degradation of soils of alarming proportions."</p></q>
Rainforest cover has gone from the equivalent of 100 in 1950 to 70 in 1997. Intriguingly, the number of elephants has reduced from 6 million in 1950 to 600,000 in 1997, which the Minister with his experience of education will know is nine times worse than decimation. Those are serious and panic figures, which should result in a level of alert far greater than I perceive in the document. It worries me that the Government are prepared to accept the document at face value without expressing more concern about its lack of urgency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
If one is fortunate enough to travel around the world, one sees appalling pollution in unexpected places. I grew up thinking that the biggest cities in the world were London, New York and Paris and being unsure which was largest of the three. Now we have 25 mega-cities with populations of more than 8 million, and the largest cities in the world are ones that one had scarcely heard of many years ago—Jakarta, Mexico City, Alexandria. Those are the areas in which there has been massive pollution. The pollution in Mexico City, and unexpected places such as Kathmandu, is horrendous, and Europe must give a lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked a greater emphasis in the document on controlling population, which I regard as a mainspring of our problems, and then pollution. We need a policy towards finite resources, which will increasingly include water. Indeed, water may be the cause of several wars in the future. Although this does not necessarily fit into environmental policy, I would have liked a reference to the promotion of democracy, because the greatest environmental hazards are happening in undemocratic countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the statesmanlike speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. It was a speech of which Conservatives could feel proud, and I am sure that it will be quoted much in the future, because it demonstrates that our party, at least, has grasped the problems that we face in the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to deal with each point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. I welcome the general support that he gave to the document and the Government's commitment to it, although it was given in a rather gratuitously churlish manner, with several sideswipes at the Government. None the less, his points deserve a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary to claim a lack of environmental action. I will not get into silly political games by saying "In your 18 years, what did you do?", but I will concentrate on some of the key areas of Government performance in the past four or five years. Climate change is unquestionably the most important. The EU is, in effect, leading the world on climate change, realising its significance, making stronger, more vigorous proposals on how to deal with it, and being prepared to accept more stringent action than any other part of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is right and necessary, but it happens through action by individual member states, and I would lay claim that the UK Government have been as influential as, and possibly more influential than any other over the past few years. It is well understood that the Deputy Prime Minister had a decisive influence at Kyoto. More recently, there was the entrenching of the mechanisms to enforce climate change at Bonn and Marrakesh, in which he played a very significant role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, our actions are not confined to climate change. There are issues of energy efficiency or conservation. We have made a commitment to end fuel poverty in all vulnerable households by 2010. We are tightening regulations in respect of the water companies. We now have a quality investment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
programme—the asset maintenance programme, AMP 3—worth between £7 billion and £8 billion, dealing with better sewage treatment, with combined sewer overflows, improved river water quality, and coastal water management. At the same time, consumer bills across the country are being reduced by an average of 12.5 per cent. That is a remarkable achievement for the next five years in the water industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that we not only have cleaner water, both in our rivers and on our coast, but have achieved a 97 per cent, pass rate—or was it 94 per cent.? I had better get my facts right, but the figure was certainly very high—for the 458 coastal bathing places. Air quality is also markedly improving in this country. The level of air pollution has improved for all the eight air pollutants, although problems still remain with particulates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have noticed that I did not mention climate change when criticising the Government. Indeed, I am very glad that they have built on what an earlier Conservative Government were doing. They have entrenched that, and that is excellent. With regard to energy conservation in homes, I hope that he will recognise that that was started by a Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister regrets, as I do, the fact that the national house-building targets for energy conservation within homes are still so low. I would like to know whether they will be improved, and whether the Government intend to push that. I am glad that he has recognised the benefits of water privatisation, which have helped to clean up water, brought in private money in and reduced bills. When it comes to air pollution, I hope that he will recognise that this builds on what Conservative Governments have done in the past, such as—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will finish it, then, by saying that I hope the Minister will recognise that this builds on what happened under a Conservative Government to ensure that cleaner fuels are used in cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you say, Mr. O'Brien, that was not a brief intervention. I do not think that it helped the Committee to have a game of ping pong about what the previous Government and the present Government have done. I shall just correct one important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that water privatisation had reduced water prices: prior to AMP 3 last year, the cost of water bills had increased by 35 per cent, in real terms since 1989. That is faster than any other single item in the retail prices index. We have now reversed that by a reduction of 12.5 per cent. I shall make no further points. The record stands for those who look it. There is no comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
The hon. Gentleman referred to waste, fridges and flooding. I will come to waste later. I have referred to fridges exhaustively. We have not been incompetent. I have already explained that the main fault lies with a surprising decision by the Commission at the last moment. We are trying to deal with that as rapidly as we can. Flooding is a serious issue. We are well aware of it. It is also unpredictable. No one expected the severity of the flooding in 1998 in the east midlands. It was greater than any in the previous century. We have been spending large sums to try to improve flood defences. We have certainly not been indolent and I resent that implication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister realises the size of the refrigerator problem. Hampshire county council plans to set aside four acres of paved land to store refrigerators. Fly tipping has been found across the country. That was predictable and predicted. Was it not possible for the Government to seek a derogation from the EU regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt about the size of the problem. It did not arise through any failing on the part of the UK Government, but as the result of the late notice of a rather surprising application of the regulation. The regulation applies directly in the UK, so any failure to comply can be taken to court. As it passed through Brussels in 1998 with the agreement of all member states, there is no precedent for seeking a subsequent derogation unless factors have arisen beyond anyone's control. That is not the case here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it have been possible to ask for a delay in the implementation of the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we considered that. We do not believe that there is a precedent for that when the matter has already gone through Brussels. It went through Brussels in 1998–99. It became operative at the beginning of this year. That is normally a sufficient lead time for action to be taken. We were let down by the late timing of the information about a particular aspect. Other member states are faced with exactly the same situation. All have to comply. We believe that there is no option. We believe that we can comply and that we have taken the necessary action to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are providing local authorities with the money for both storage and treatment, where that takes place, until the end of the financial year. Where more money will be required beyond then, as it certainly will, we are carefully considering what the sum should be, for what period, and what we expect local authorities to do. All local authorities run civic amenity sites. It is not as if the storage of white electronic equipment does not already take place across the country on a considerable scale. The problem is that the rate of shift from those amenity sites into treatment plants is slowed down because of the current lack of such plants. We are taking urgent measures to deal with that. I have already said that we expect several—half a dozen or a dozen—companies to construct new plants in the near future in order to reduce the pressure on local authority storage.

The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire made a lengthy speech about the requirements of business. Business is an extremely important stakeholder—no one would deny that for a moment and we would assert it strongly—but he did not say a word about citizens or the work force. He made it clear that the Conservative party stands for business—that was the implication— but many people in business today might find that rather presumptuous. It is significant that he said nothing about the people who work for companies as opposed to those who manage them, or about citizens, who are important when considering environmental impacts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about companies being penalised, but we work closely with business and we have an Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment. On the critical issue of climate change, we are the first country in the world to set up an emissions trading scheme so that businesses can secure commercial advantage from being first into the market for reducing emissions. We have the avid support of business in launching that initiative in April this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that business should be aware of its own performance. I entirely agree. Does he therefore support requiring businesses to report their environmental performance so that management itself—as well as the rest of us—is aware of environmental impacts? I hope that I can number him in that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that the Conservative party was passionate about preserving the natural heritage. That took my breath away when I recalled that the largest road-building programme since the Romans, as we were told at the time, was initiated under Mrs. Thatcher. That involved the destruction of Twyford down. I could list many more factors, but waste is a major issue, and the Opposition have very little to crow about that. In 1992, after 13 years of Tory rule, the waste recycling level was just 2 per cent. It is now 10 or 11 per cent., which is nowhere near good enough, but a considerable advance on 2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman claimed to be raising targets on renewables—always convenient when in opposition. I agree that the current level is far too low, but it is slowly going up. It was 1 or 2 per cent, in the 1990s and is now about 3 per cent. As he knows, we are committed to 10 per cent, by 2010. I accept that that must be raised after 2010 and I suggest that he reads the PIU report for our conclusions on that score. Will it be published? I said that it is a report for the Prime Minister, and it is a matter for him to decide whether and when to publish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed naming, shaming and fame exercises. I am in favour, provided that accurate and comprehensive information is available and that the real constraints on companies and countries are properly understood. It was interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman say that we should avoid gold-plating, but I believe that a balance must be drawn here. He asked how swiftly sanctions would be levied, which picks up a point raised by the hon. Member for Ludlow. It is of course a matter for the Commission.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
The sanction is that if a country fails to provide information that the Commission is entitled to have—I am not sure if there are any precedents; I believe that all member states comply—it has the power to fine that country, just as it has the power to fine companies. Countries take responsibility for companies operating within their boundaries for failure to meet the targets of individual directives. That applies to all member states, including the UK. The sanctions are there and they will be levied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is treading on thin ice when he says that little action is being taken regarding waste. Whether the action is sufficient is a matter of judgment, but it is a great deal more than was previously taken. We have implemented statutory recycling targets for the first time, as I am sure he knows. Every local authority in the country will have to double its recycling level within three years, by 2003–04 and to treble it within five years, by 2005–06. That is a fairly tough target. Maybe it is not enough, but let whoever says so speak to local authorities that say that it is impossible or extremely difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Matthew Green</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger that the UK Government are attempting to meet those recycling targets in a way that puts the onus on councils. Those councils that started early in building up their recycling percentage have been rewarded, shall we say, by the Government with significantly higher targets to reach than those that were less diligent earlier. In my constituency, a rural area, South Shropshire district council did well earlier on but, being rural, perhaps faces more difficulties. The other district councils in Shropshire now have lower targets and it is easier for them to achieve them, owing to both their geography and the fact that they were less diligent earlier. Perhaps the Minister would comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am glad to. We have taken account of that point. I was referring to the averages across the country. We accept that some local authorities already have recycling rates of 15 per cent or more—25 per cent in some cases, and in a few cases even above that. They cannot be expected to double and treble their rates in the same way. Let me be honest: Oldham has 5 per cent recycling, which is very low. We have accepted that the figures we have published for all local authorities will be lower for the high-performing local authorities for exactly the reason given by the hon. Gentleman. The low-performing authorities have to do rather better than doubling and trebling their rates. We have compressed both the bottom and the top to take account of his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding waste management, first, there are statutory recycling targets. Secondly, we have put in place the institution WRAP—Waste Resources Action Programme—as a body to assist in providing markets for recyclers. Thirdly, we have put in place the funding. Those are the three requirements: the targets, the markets and the funding. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire referred to the £140 million recycling fund for local authorities on which we are now consulting. He ignored the fact that the main
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
component is in the rate support grant. There is an item for environmental protection and cultural services—a rather odd combination, it seems to me, but that is traditionally how it has been included and categorised—at £1.172 billion over the next three years. That is a substantial sum. It will go to cultural services, which is a rather panjandrum title. I believe that about half of it will go to improving waste management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also ignored the £220 million provision for private finance initiative contracts for providing waste infrastructure and £50 million under the new opportunities fund for community recycling. The funding is on a substantial scale. It is not fair to say that the Government have not moved on all the key areas.

I accept that the title "sustainable development" does not send people into a frisson of excitement in the Dog and Duck in Oldham. The hon. Gentleman said that he favours 50 per cent, household waste recycling and composting within a time scale, and kerbside collection for all local authorities. I repeat that when in opposition it is easy to give high-sounding and ambitious targets. I am in favour of pressing targets as far as they are practicable to achieve. We believe that kerbside collection will be a necessary component in every local authority because of the targets of doubling or trebling. Those targets will not be achieved without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the hon. Gentleman's question about targets, the truth is that other member states had greater difficulty than the United Kingdom in meeting the deadline for phasing out subsidies. Perhaps the most significant issue is coal subsidies, which are used at a high level in Germany. That is well understood and has been much discussed. As regards the renegotiation of EU coal state aid regulations, the Government have no plans for further subsidies. However, we have accepted that continuing state aid for the coal industry should be permitted, because of the exceptional circumstances in places that are over-dependent on coal, providing that appropriate limiting conditions exist, including subsidised coal not undercutting international prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have responded to the question of targets and sanctions in the document. The hon. Gentleman asked what can happen if member states do not supply the information; the answer is that they can be fined. I do not think that that has yet happened, nor that such defiance would occur. However, if there is a failure within the time scale, the Commission has an effective mechanism that all other member states support.

The failure of the United States to comply with Kyoto was also raised. The hon. Gentleman said that without the United States, Kyoto is just an aspiration, but I do not agree. The United States is an important country, and not only in terms of its economics and power. However, it is only one of around 179 countries in the world. Every one, without exception, signed up to Kyoto and all, with the United States as the only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
exception, agreed at Bonn and Marrakesh to the measures to embed and implement what was agreed to in Kyoto in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States is important because it has 4.5 or 5 per cent, of the world population and produces 25 per cent, of total greenhouse gas emissions. However, we should not neglect the other 75 per cent. I hope that the hon. Gentleman was not suggesting that, because the US is not complying, none of the rest of us should. That would be a nonsense policy and would mean that the concentration of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> in the atmosphere, which is slowly but steadily rising, would go up faster. All of us, without exception, would suffer from the floods, hurricanes, rising sea levels and many other consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right policy is to try to bring the United States back on side, and all of us have made it clear, publicly and privately, that that is what should happen. President Bush has said that in his view the Kyoto protocol is flawed, and he gave two reasons for that: the impact on the US economy and the fact that developing countries—read China—have not yet accepted targets. We dispute both those arguments for non-compliance. He has also said that the United States does recognise the problem of global warming and will come up with its own proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the right way forward is to press the United States, as 11 September gradually fades—in the sense that time has now moved on, normal politics resumes and the State Department and other United States Departments can give this issue their full attention—to make its proposals at the earliest possible moment. We will examine those proposals with great care to see how far they go towards meeting the targets, and if we consider that they are inadequate, we shall tell them. That is a far better way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the delivery of goals. We remain committed to delivering them. It is helpful to have a more focused, strategic and integrative framework. The Environment Council cannot achieve environmental goals itself. It depends on the other directorates—transport, industry, energy and agriculture—and on ECOFIN: the financial side is extremely important. They all need to be integrated in a framework with a commitment to sustainable development.

This is a useful document. I am grateful for all the comments made in the Committee in general support of it. We must now ensure that it is properly and fully implemented. The United Kingdom Government will play a full part in doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
