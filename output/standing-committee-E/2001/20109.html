As this is the first Treasury debate since the recess, I hope that you will agree that it is in order for me and my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Opposition Front-Bench Treasury team to express our sincere sympathy for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mrs. Brown on the tragic death of their baby daughter. I know that words are pitifully inadequate in such circumstances, but I hope that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will accept that our condolences are felt widely throughout the House and that people of all political persuasions will want to keep the Chancellor and his wife in their thoughts and prayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the broad economic policy guidelines is to help ensure that the economic policies of member states are consistent with the goals of the treaty. Those goals include non-inflationary economic growth, respect for the environment, a high level of employment and social protection, and rising standards of living and quality of life. The guidelines form a central part of the process of multilateral surveillance in the European Union, and build on the other processes of EU multilateral surveillance, including the stability and growth pact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formal basis for the European Union's broad economic policy guidelines is set out in article 99 of the EC treaty, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission, formulate a draft for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and of the Community, and shall report its findings to the European Council."</p></blockquote>
In accordance with article 99 of the treaty, ECOFIN adopted the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines for member states and the European Union at the Gothenburg European Council on 16 June 2001. Article 249 of the treaty makes it clear that the recommendations included in the broad economic policy guidelines are non-binding on member states. It provides that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force".</p></blockquote>
The guidelines that we are debating today set out the Council's views on economic priorities for 2001 and provide the reference text for the Council and the Commission to review economic developments within the EU and member states. Although the 2001 guidelines were agreed by ECOFIN in June 2001, I am more than happy to participate in this debate, which was requested by the European Scrutiny Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear in my original explanatory memorandum, the United Kingdom has been keen to develop the role of the broad economic policy guidelines. The Government believe that the 2001 guidelines reflect our main priorities—in particular, promotion of the wider economic reform agenda. Indeed, it is essential that the broad economic policy guidelines fully reflect the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, promoting employment and social inclusion, and improving the performance of the European economies. We have also emphasised the importance of making those objectives sharper; of setting milestones for the implementation of reforms; of benchmarking good practice, and of developing structural reform indicators as a priority; and of putting those objectives into practice through policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The year 2000 saw high growth and falling unemployment in Europe. However, the period in 2001 that preceded the latest guidelines saw a markedly less favourable economic environment, with high oil prices, slowing global demand and an unexpected slowdown in economic activity in the United States, although growth in member states held up well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many significant developments in the economic situation since the guidelines were agreed in June, as the European Scrutiny Committee rightly recognised in its report of its discussions on my explanatory memorandum and the guidelines. I am sure that hon. Members are fully aware of those developments, so I will not dwell on them. Instead, I will focus on the strategy that underpins the guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 2001 broad economic policy guidelines focus on the medium and long-term implications of structural policies, and on reforms aimed at promotion of economic growth potential, employment and social cohesion. They also focus on the transition towards a knowledge-based economy and policies for sustainable development. Against that, they concentrate on four key challenges for European policy, which are to preserve expansion in growth and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
jobs, to improve the basis for future growth and employment, to prepare for the impact of ageing populations and to ensure close policy co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve those aims, the guidelines make specific recommendations. They suggest ensuring growth-and-stability-oriented macro-economic policies, to position the economy on a sustained, higher non-inflationary growth and employment path. They recommend improving the quality and sustainability of public finances, maintaining sound budgetary positions and finding an appropriate balance between reducing public debt, cutting taxes and financing public investment. Labour markets should be invigorated, the guidelines say, to tackle problems of unemployment by addressing skills shortages, making structural improvements and increasing participation in the labour market, especially among women and older workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further recommendations are: to ensure efficient product markets by increasing liberalisation of markets and reinforcing competition; to promote the efficiency and integration of the European Union financial services market, to allow an improved allocation and lower cost of capital in the EU; to encourage entrepreneurship, creating a more favourable environment for business needs in Europe; to foster a knowledge-based economy by establishing competitive and well functioning product and capital markets, increasing the use of ICT and strengthening education and training; and to enhance environmental sustainability to ensure the responsible use of scarce resources, by increasing the use of market-based instruments as a means to promote sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines for 2001 have drawn significantly on the findings of the so-called implementation report that the Commission produced as a follow-up to the 2000 guidelines. The Government feel that that method of monitoring is an important step in consolidating the progress made to date, and it should help embed the notion of economic reform in Europe in the minds of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific, albeit non-binding, recommendations that apply to the United Kingdom are also consistent with the Government's approach to economic policy. They especially emphasise the needs to maintain sound public finances, to reinforce measures targeted at those prone to the risk of long-term unemployment and inactivity, to address the relatively low level of productivity in the UK, to improve transport infrastructure and to encourage the role of pension funds in the development of the risk capital market. The general direction of the recommendations is in line with the Government's stated policy objectives, and measures taken since we came into office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK Government made it clear that the Commission, in its recommendation for the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines, had exceeded its remit by proposing a UK-specific guideline stating that the expected ratio of UK public-sector current expenditure to gross domestic product should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
exceed 37.3 per cent. The Government ensured that that reference was removed from the final broad economic guidelines; in its report on the 2001 guidelines, the European Scrutiny Committee welcomed that change. Decisions on the level of public spending in each member state and each Government's fiscal rules are for member states. The UK Government's fiscal rules ensure sound and sustainable public finances while enabling increased investment in priority public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next round of multilateral surveillance is about to get under way, and will culminate in the formulation of the 2002 broad economic policy guidelines around the middle of the year. The UK is keen to play a constructive role in encouraging economic reform and participating fully in the important process of economic policy co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that such questions should be brief and one at a time. Hon. Members will have ample opportunity to ask several questions if they want to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 6 of the Council's recommendations contains a growth forecast for the eurozone countries of 2.75 per cent. for 2001–02. In view of what has happened since the guidelines were drawn up, does the Minister think that that forecast is still valid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, when the broad economic guidelines were drawn up it could not have been perceived that the economic climate would deteriorate considerably not only in the EU, but throughout the world and particularly in the United States. The guidelines recognise that the economic outlook may change, and they will be interpreted in that context. It would not be appropriate for me to give my personal forecast for growth in the EU, but I am pleased to say that our assessment of the UK's performance is that growth will be in the range of 2 to 2.5 per cent, so the outlook is cautiously optimistic. In the current uncertain climate, it is difficult to say with precision what the outcome will be, but the measures that we have taken to entrench sound public finances and to lower interest rates should give us a certain stability in this uncertain period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate European Union economic policy, but I am slightly concerned that it took six months for the guidelines to come before the Scrutiny Committee. I understand that we had the recess and the general election, but the procedure still took rather a long time. Will my hon. Friend comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I am happy to take part in this scrutiny debate, which is an important part of Parliament's involvement in the process. The procedure over the past year has been slightly unusual, but events conspired against us. In the usual course of events, the guidelines would have been debated before the summer. This time, however, Parliament was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
dissolved for the election before the European Scrutiny Committee had the opportunity to debate the guidelines for 2001. It was not reconstituted until 17 July and did not, unfortunately, have a chance to consider the explanatory memorandum until later that month. As far as I am aware, it requested a debate only when it reported on the explanatory memorandum in the middle of October. Obviously, the terrible events of 11 September have put enormous pressure on parliamentary time, and I am afraid to say that this was the first opportunity that we could find in the parliamentary calendar to debate the guidelines. However, I am pleased to be here today to answer hon. Members' questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow up the Minister's answer to my earlier question. Given that the growth forecasts for Europe in the Government's pre-Budget report are significantly lower than the 2.75 per cent. forecast in the guidelines, to what extent do the conclusions and policy recommendations in the documents need to be modified in light of events in the past six months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the economic environment has changed substantially since the guidelines were published. They state that the assessment that will be made in 2002 of whether they have been met
	<br><blockquote><p>"will take also into account major changes in the general economic environment."</p></blockquote>
It would, therefore, be premature for me to say how growth outcomes might be judged in 2002.I reiterate that it is difficult in this uncertain climate to say precisely what the outcome for the EU economy will be. We made our best possible forecasts for many areas at the time of the pre-Budget report; they will next be updated in the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We see before us a number of recommendations specific to member states. That for Italy clearly recognises the economic divide between northern and southern Italy. A similar economic divide exists in this country, although not to the same extent, but that does not appear to have been taken into account in the recommendations for the United Kingdom. Has attention or thought been given to that, and how might we address the north-south economic divide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for her point. The question of how regional divides can be addressed and bridged is interesting. It would be inappropriate for me, as a UK Minister, to comment on economic developments in Italy, which has commissioned and engaged in its own discussions on the recommendations in the broad economic policy guidelines that apply to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, regional growth and productivity is an issue that UK Treasury Ministers have uppermost in their minds. Alongside the pre-Budget report, we published a separate document that addressed regional performance and how productivity in each region could be improved and increased to match the best in the country. We take the matter very seriously and are determined to address it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to page 20 of the Council recommendations and the commitment that is given, inter alia, to "accelerate the liberalisation" of the railway industry. Can the Minister say what the Government are doing to accelerate the liberalisation of the railway industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that we are doing is making up for the chronic underinvestment in our public infrastructure, particularly our transport infrastructure, over the past 20 or even 30 years. Investment in our transport infrastructure is set to increase by £180 billion over 10 years. That will increase the level of infrastructure spending by 75 per cent. in real terms, which will go a long way to improve transport infrastructure. It is a bit rich of the Opposition to talk about the liberalisation of the rail industry when the current crisis in the transport industry is a result of the Conservative party's policies, its failed privatisation and its lack of public investment in transport. We are attempting to take action on both fronts—to design a model that will put safety and passengers first, and to invest both public and private money—in order to ensure that in 10 years' time we have a transport infrastructure that is among the best in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a technical question? There is always a tension in independent reports between the need for completely autonomous assessment and the need for constructive dialogue. Can the Minister advise at what stage during the development of these reports the British Government were involved and consulted? How far does she feel that we are co-authors of the final document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not go so far as to say that we are co-authors. Clearly, our views on the economic environment in the United Kingdom were taken into account when the broad economic policy guidelines were drawn up. They were debated at ECOFIN among all Finance Ministers, and we had an opportunity to look at the draft and to make comments on the guidelines. As I pointed out in my opening speech, we removed from the draft broad economic guidelines a reference that we thought was wholly inappropriate and exceeded the Commission's remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independence of the process is demonstrated by the fact that the Commission was willing to state what it first thought but was prepared to be swayed by our argument that it had gone beyond its remit. Of course, the UK and other member countries are closely involved. There is dialogue with the Commission, at ministerial and official levels, concerning the state of our economy and the measures that we are taking to boost productivity, raise the level of growth and increase the number of jobs in our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) has already referred to regional inequalities. I want to refer to national inequalities in labour market conditions. I note from the documents that the Commission recommends active measures targeted at those communities most prone to the risk of concentrated and long-term
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
unemployment. I want to impress on the Minister the importance of targeting and ask what the Government are doing about it. In case she is tempted to refer to the objective 1 funding for west Wales and the valleys, one of the measures introduced to target unemployment, I should inform her that those measures have been greeted with widespread disappointment in Wales in the past 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The United Kingdom's success in job creation and the flexibility of its labour markets was recognised explicitly by the Commission and, whereas most member states received two or three recommendations on their labour markets, the UK received only one, which was, more or less, to continue the strategy that we are already undertaking to target measures on those who most need to be reintegrated into the work force. For example, we are helping disabled people to find work through the new deal for disabled people. I was pleased to see that the pilot was set up in my constituency, so I have first-hand experience of the measures that we are taking on that front. We have introduced measures on tax credits to help people to move from long-term unemployment into the job market. We also agreed that we should continue the process of targeting help on lone parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is probably well aware of the measures that we are taking, through the new deal for lone parents, the working families tax credit and the child care tax credit, to help lone parents move from long-term inactivity into work. We are also continuing the process of reaching out to ethnic minorities. The Government will invest £15 million in the next three years to help people in those communities to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to achieving balanced economic growth throughout the UK. We certainly aim to promote productivity and to increase employment in all regions, especially those that suffer from the worst problems of long-term unemployment. As one of the tools to achieve that aim in England, we are using regional development agencies to co-ordinate the economic strategies for each region alongside regional venture capital funds, which will promote entrepreneurship and encourage job creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also investing in communities through the neighbourhood renewal fund and new deal for communities, so it is not only objective 1 status that the Government are trying to obtain for disadvantaged regions. We are using a vast array of tools to ensure that people are best equipped to move from unemployment or long-term inactivity back into the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guidance focuses on economic stability. I am sure that the Minister would agree that there are two types of instability—boom and bust. I am concerned in particular that the effect of the growth and stability pact, but also the general thrust of European policy, is to constrain excessive spending and, therefore, to deal with the tendency towards boom, when in fact we are tending towards bust, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
which a more relaxed policy, which might go beyond the restrictions of the growth and stability pact, might be more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that we need to interpret the growth and stability pact in a prudent and sensible way. We need to examine the matter in an intelligent fashion and the pact needs to be flexible enough to deal with different economic climates. As has been recommended in the broad economic policy guidelines, the UK is using the automatic stabilisers as much as it can, which injects an element of flexibility and allows fiscal policy to support monetary policy in these testing times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is an external shock such as that which occurred after 11 September or as might happen to the UK as a result of a downturn in its export markets, it is important to have a degree of flexibility. It is also important to allow countries to ensure that they prudently maintain overall general Government debt levels at around 60 per cent., as laid down in the stability and growth pact, while allowing sufficient room for countries such as the UK to tackle chronic, long-term underinvestment in our public services. We agree that an element of flexibility is necessary and we are committed to a prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact. As I have said, our approach has been recognised in the broad economic policy guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the deceptive question asked by the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), may I press the Minister on her endorsement of the need, stated clearly in the Council document, to maintain sound public finances in accordance with the stability pact? Is she satisfied that general Government lending as a percentage of the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom is set to grow from -0.1 in 2002 to -0.9 in 2003, -1 in 2004 and probably up to -1.1 in the financial year 2005–06? That is a steady worsening of the public finances, an adverse trend that is replicated in no other European Union country during that period. Are the Government proud of that projected record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that our record on the public finances is very impressive indeed. When this Government came to power, the public debt had doubled under the previous Administration. We took swift action to put that right and that has stood us in good stead to meet this time of new uncertainty. It has enabled us to reduce interest rates to their lowest level in 40 years and has enabled us to use fiscal policy now, just when it is needed to support monetary policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are committed to using the automatic stabilisers; it would be madness not to. The Government have introduced measures such as the golden rule on current finances and the sound investment rule for debt over the medium term, which have put us in a position of strength in relation to the public finances. Operating that fiscal framework alongside a clear monetary framework that has operational independence within the Bank of England, and which is no longer prone to political interference,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
enables us to steer a course through these uncertain times. We can be proud of our record on the public finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also point out that we are set to meet the Maastricht criteria very comfortably for 2001–02. The International Monetary Fund said in its recent report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current nine-year expansion marks the longest period of sustained non-inflationary growth of the UK economy in more than 30 years. Output has increased by an average of 3 per cent. per year during 1993–2000, inflation has remained subdued, and unemployment is now at its lowest level in a quarter century. While activity has decelerated with the slowdown in world demand, this year the UK will grow faster than any other G-7 country."</p></blockquote>
One reason why we can do so is that we use fiscal policy sensibly. We have a record of which we can be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the previous question, does the Minister agree that there seems to be a slight tendency towards a deflationary bias in some of the Commission's recommendations? We are familiar with the difference between the Bank of England's guidelines, which contain balanced and symmetrical targets for inflation not to exceed or fall below a certain level, and those of the European central bank, which has only the upper guideline—not to exceed a certain level. These recommendations have a similar tone: they advise in restraining Government spending and limiting economic policy on what could be called the upside. Does the Minister feel concerned about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but I point out to him that the Commission accepted that it exceeded its remit by commenting on our level of public spending. That is an issue that should clearly be left to national Government to determine. The only interest in that matter for the members of ECOFIN is in our having sustainable debt levels. It is important for that approach to be recognised, as it has been in the Council of Ministers. Therefore, I would not go as far as my hon. Friend in suggesting that there is any bias.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend, however, that the symmetrical inflation target for the UK has served us well in recent years, in allowing the Bank of England to take a more balanced approach to monetary policy in this country. It has moved us away from the policy introduced by the last Conservative Government, which kept inflation under 2.5 per cent. and did not view excesses on the downside as equally counterproductive as excesses on the upside. That development has been an important part of the improvement of the general macro-economic framework in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government support the commitment in the guidelines to reinforce competition by accelerating the liberalisation of the network industries, including railways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, we have been at the forefront of liberalising many of the network industries. For example, in 1998 we introduced the Competition Act to enhance productivity and to consider aspects in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
which competition could be improved. With British Telecom and the telecommunications industry, the Government have taken measures to unbundle the network and allow access where it was previously restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman again makes specific reference to our transport infrastructure. I thought that I had answered that point at some length. It was the Conservative Administration's failed policies that led to the current debacle in the railway system. A coherent approach is needed that recognises that, alongside a sensible structure for overseeing passenger safety and putting passengers first, investment must be made in the public infrastructure. We are committed to doing those things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted by my hon. Friend's restatement of the Government's commitment to increase public investment in public services. That is long overdue, and we still have a long way to go before we can repair the damage done to public services by previous Conservative Governments. I would like to go further than my own Government on that matter, and I hope to encourage them in that direction over the next few months and years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend comment on the Council's extraordinary request that Britain should reduce its already low public spending to even less than 37.3 per cent. as a proportion of GDP, while suggesting that Denmark, with 49 per cent. of its GDP committed to public spending, should spend no more than that? I am happy with Denmark's level of public spending, but is it not extraordinary that there is one rule for Britain and another for Denmark?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question, but I should point out that the guidelines are debated in Council. It is Ministers who accept or reject the Commission's recommendations, the broad economic policy guidelines and the country-specific guidelines. The Council recognised that it had exceeded its remit in commenting on our level of public expenditure. It is clearly outside its legitimate authority to make remarks on those matters. ECOFIN does not have an interest in member states' fiscal decisions on spending in particular areas of priority, or on the taxes that they raise to finance them. We made our case well about that, and others agreed with us. It is now established that such comments should not be made again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I redirect the Minister's attention to her earlier answer to me? I was talking not about the record, but about the document, and asking why the trend projected for the UK in the Council document is towards budgetary deficit in the period to 2004 whereas for the other member states it is even towards surplus. Can the Minister comment on the reliability of the figures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, the true figure is about 2.7 per cent. up against the relevant Maastricht stability pact upper limit. In the case of Italy, it will be noted from page 47 that with respect to one aspect of the stability pact—overall debt to GDP—Italy is twice outside the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
guidelines. Are not the figures to be taken with a large pinch of salt? They are out of date and the projections are unreliable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's line of argument, except to admit that by definition the figures are of course out of date. Events have moved on since they were prepared and when the matter returns to the Council in spring, the significant deterioration in the external environment will be taken into account in interpreting the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not become involved in a debate about other member states' broad economic policy guidelines, but the hon. Gentleman has restated his point about our fiscal projections. I assure him that our fiscal projections are in line with a prudent, sensible interpretation of the stability and growth pact—one that takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the importance of public investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must recognise that, unlike other member states, we use cautious assumptions to make our fiscal projections. I do not see any inconsistency between our approach and the broad economic policy guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 23 of the Council recommendation document there are fairly general recommendations to promote the access to and use of information and communications technology, including the implementation of the electronic signature directive, adoption of the proposals on copyright, distance marketing, VAT and electronic invoicing, and the development and implementation of a strategy on ICT security. The Minister will not yet have seen a draft document from EURIM, the industry group that specialises in the subject. It suggests that there would be technical and public-acceptance difficulties in progressing electronic identification and authentication as fast as we would like. The subject should be a high priority. Does the Minister agree that that is the case? Will she press European partners to work with us to try to move the agenda forward? It is extremely important to our industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is obviously an expert on such matters, and I shall pass his comments on to the e-commerce Minister. I shall bear them in mind myself. We are firmly committed to the use of ICT. It is at the forefront of our initiatives to increase productivity and boost the knowledge-based economy. We want to ensure that people have access to the internet. We are committed to ensuring that everyone who wants access to the internet has it by 2005, and that 100 per cent. of schools have access to it as well. Alongside school access, we are putting in place a system of on-line centres based in communities, so that there is much broader access than in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My reading of the Council recommendations is that all member states are committed to presenting comprehensive strategies to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
address the economic and budgetary challenges posed by ageing populations in future, and that those documents will be presented with the annual stability and convergence programmes. They will also be examined in the context of multilateral surveillance, which presumably means something comparable to the ECOFIN consideration of the broad economic policy guidelines. What are the Government doing to implement that commitment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the UK is better placed than most other EU countries to meet its pension liabilities in future. The recent report on ageing populations by the economic policy committee of ECOFIN projects that public pension spending will fall as a percentage of GDP from its present figure of 5.5 per cent. to 4.4 per cent. by 2050. The difference between our pension structure and those in the rest of the Europe is well known. We rely much more on the funded pension system, and face less severe demographic pressures than other European countries do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to ensuring that we tackle pensioner poverty as part of our agenda to help people in their old age. That is why we introduced reforms such as the minimum income guarantee, the winter fuel allowance, free eye tests and help with concessionary fares for pensioners. It is why we have introduced the pension credit—the relevant Bill recently passed through Parliament—to help pensioners who also have modest savings to gain the benefit of those savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might help my hon. Friend in relation to the apparent contrast between our public spending figures and those of other European nations. On 2 December, 	<i>The Observer</i> suggested that some of the eurozone countries indulged in
	<br><blockquote><p>"fiscal acrobatics that saw billions of euros of future spending parked off member countries' balance sheets".</p></blockquote>
They disguise their public spending, to an extent, by removing some inconvenient items. The article suggested that that was
	<br><blockquote><p>"the slimming equivalent of weighing yourself with one foot resting on the bathroom carpet".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we do not do that in Britain while some of the eurozone countries do. If so, that is why we are more honest and why there might be a contrast between them and us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed my hon. Friend's remarks, but it would not be wise to debate specific policies and confront the liabilities that other EU countries may face. Our country is fortunate to have a system that relies more heavily than those of others on the funded pension scheme. We shall face strong demographic pressures in future, but they will not be as intense as those faced in other countries. The European Union system also has no bail-out for countries that do not adequately tackle such issues, which clearly intensifies the pressure on them to prevent demographic pressures from overwhelming them. We watch that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The United Kingdom approved the present proposals at the ministerial Council in June. First, will the Economic Secretary explain why the UK endorsed the pursuit of further tax co-ordination to avoid harmful tax competition? The UK's low-tax regime has given us a higher growth rate and more jobs than elsewhere in the European Union. Secondly, how will a more uniform application of VAT systems in the European Union help entrepreneurship? How will VAT on children's clothes and shoes, food or transport improve our competitiveness and our ability to create jobs and prosperity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how many times the Government have said that they are not in favour of forced tax harmonisation. Clearly, we are not in favour of imposing VAT on items such as domestic fuel, as the Conservative Government did—a move that we were forced to reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They doubled it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. My hon. Friend tells us by exactly how much VAT on fuel went up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I voted against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman voted against it; that shows, at least, that he is a man of integrity. However, he well knows that the Government are not in favour of tax harmonisation. We favour a sensible policy of tax competition, which is why we have argued for cooperation and competition, where they make economic sense. We shall never be forced into a situation where Brussels asks us to adopt a particular tax regime, because that would be far beyond its competence and would require unanimity. The hon. Gentleman reads far too much into the documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a slight gloss to the Minister's alternative view of the issue, I should say that there has traditionally been a variety of opinions in the Committee on such subjects. Does she agree that the harmonisation of excise rates would be helpful? As regards tobacco smuggling, we can hardly sustain different rates from those across the channel, and there are similar problems with alcohol and other products. The distinction seems to be between goods, which can be moved easily around the European Union and which are easy to smuggle, and services, individual taxation and corporate taxation, which cannot be so easily transferred and for which harmonisation would be inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments but, as he is probably aware, I disagree. Taxation matters are properly left to democratically chosen national Governments with competence in such matters. Tax competition is a natural and good thing, but I would not want to follow the line that my hon. Friend suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that answer, why have the Government signed up, on page 25, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an appropriate framework for energy taxation at the European level"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, some energy matters have a wider application than to the United Kingdom alone. The initiatives that we are considering include emissions trading, which would allow energy-intensive firms that pollute the environment to trade with one another. That would help reduce the level of emissions at as low a cost as possible, which is why we are piloting such measures. Some initiatives can be examined in the European context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse my hon. Friend's reference to the right of member states to set their own excise duties. I think particularly of alcohol duties; if they were reduced to European levels, there would be a surge in drinking in this country that would be even more damaging than at present. I should declare an interest, in that I chair the all-party alcohol group, but my question is on a different subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the employment of older workers in the European Union. On page 19 of the document, a table shows the percentage of older workers employed in the member states. It lists Britain in fourth place. Denmark is second and Sweden is first. Economic performance and employment levels generally are better in those countries at the top of the table. Is it significant, or is it a happy coincidence, that those three countries are outside the eurozone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend would agree, but one of the factors that has promoted job creation here—it has been an important force behind the rise in our employment rates, which are now among the best in the world—is the flexibility of the labour market, and the fact that it is now much easier for firms to employ workers without risk. The flexibility of our labour market has been widely recognised, and it is endorsed in the broad economic policy guidelines. It does not depend on whether member states are participating in the eurozone. It is about measures that promote structural reform. We are committed to economic and structural reform, and the labour market is an important element of that framework. I am pleased to say that Spain, which has just assumed the EU presidency, has made labour market reform one of its five key objectives, and I hope to see that strategy gain momentum over the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a good employment record for older workers, although I would be encouraged if the rate were to increase. We still have a significant degree of inactivity among older workers, but the Government take it seriously and want to help through our initiatives on active ageing and other forums such as the new deal for the over-50s. We must continue to take those issues seriously. We certainly should not congratulate ourselves too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Economic Secretary back to the question of the ageing population? My previous question was not about pensions policy but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
about the process to be implemented at European level that is documented in the papers before us. The commitment in the guidelines that each country should submit a report on its pensions, welfare and other policies affecting the elderly in the same way as it now submits a plan on its economic policies, implies that those welfare and pensions documents will be considered at Council level. If so, that is a major shift in the scrutiny—and, to use a mild word, coordination—of welfare and pensions policies at supranational level. Is that what will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; the hon. Gentleman is incorrect. The Government are committed to a process of peer review and benchmarking, particularly in areas of structural and economic reform. We already have the Cardiff process of peer review of structural reform. We also have the Luxembourg process on employment, where the framework is agreed and the objectives set at the European level, but national Governments are free to implement policies in their own area that they consider to be suited to their economic, social and cultural environment. I welcome the process of peer review. As member states, we have much to learn from one another. The peer review process will go some way to encourage co-operation and learning, which will, in the end, raise productivity growth and increase job creation throughout the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister answered a mischievous question from the Opposition about why we agreed to a framework for energy taxation at a European level. However, does she agree that what is in fact proposed is a framework for the use of market-based instruments at Community level—in other words, a framework to make it easier for each Government to set their own policies, rather than a harmonised rate of tax, for which I might wish but I am sure that she would not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the sort of process to which I was referring. When general objectives are agreed at a European level it is then up to member states to implement the processes that they consider appropriate for their own environments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

When the assessment is carried out it will be robust and comprehensive and consider all the relevant economic issues. It would clearly be inappropriate for me to speculate now on
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
what the outcome of that assessment will be, but we are fully committed to conducting that assessment in the first half of this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have raised the matter of the five economic tests with the Minister before. However, there has been more press comment on the possibility of a sixth economic test, which is, I would suggest, the most important of all—to get the exchange rate right before one goes in. If we ever decided to enter the euro, that rate would have to be considerably lower than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Government, in endorsing the guidelines, have signed up to sustainable growth and enhanced entrepreneurship, can the Minister say whether the drive towards capital accumulation in the guidelines will lead the Government to enlightened policies such as a reduction in, if not an elimination of, capital gains tax and inheritance tax? In the context of the energy taxation framework, will the Minister take the hauliers' strictures to heart and move to harmonise motor fuel duties in line with those on the continent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government take access to capital very seriously, which is why we have introduced capital allowances, and why we are committed to making it as easy to invest as possible, particularly by providing a stable macro-economic environment. If one considers the financial services forum, one can see that opening up capital markets across the European Union is one of our priorities, and the basis of an argument in which we are continually engaged at the European level. For example, we have argued for the prospectus directive, which would open up the possibility of raising capital in different parts of the EU and could, if it were properly implemented, reduce the cost of capital across the EU. That is one reason why the Chancellor committed himself to a deadline of 2003 for implementing the risk capital action plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital accumulation is a long-term project, to which the Government are committed. Since we came to office in 1997, we have made a start on it in the public sector, as well as creating the right environment for the private sector to invest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 8261/01 and 9326/01 on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines; and supports the Government's welcome for the publication of the Guidelines in giving operational content to the conclusions of the Lisbon and Stockholm summits, in reflecting the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, and in promoting employment and social inclusion.—	<i>[Ruth Kelly.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by taking up the point made by the hon. Member for Luton, North about the long delay in arranging this debate. I checked when the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
debated, and discovered that they were debated in European Standing Committee B in June of that year—much closer to the time at which the documents were considered by the European institutions and endorsed, or otherwise, by the Government. Admittedly, on that occasion the debate centred on one document alone, which contained the recommendations from the Commission before they had been amended by the Council. However, the time scale on this occasion, even if one makes allowance for the general election, gives cause for concern over the effectiveness of parliamentary scrutiny. It also calls into question the relevance of some of the assumptions contained in the documents, bearing in mind what has happened in the European and world economies in the nine months since the Commission published its original draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's recommendations were submitted to the Council on 27 April 2001, considered by the Council on 30 April and sent by the Treasury to the Scrutiny Committee after the general election, on 20 June. The Council recommendations were made on 15 June 2001, but the Treasury did not send them to the Scrutiny Committee for a month after that, on 19 July 2001. The Government then decided to send the House into recess for three months last summer, which meant that there was no opportunity to debate the documents in that period. The Scrutiny Committee considered the documents on 17 October; three months after that debate, the House finally has an opportunity, through this Standing Committee, to consider the guidelines, which are now out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is entitled to say that the Scrutiny Committee might have considered the documents earlier, but even the three months that have elapsed since that Committee debate in October 2001 gave the Government plenty of time to bring forward the guidelines for debate. My suspicion is that the Government did not want to discuss the Commission document alone, because it contained embarrassing recommendations about the level of Government debt, which they wanted to sort out with the Council before allowing Parliament to have a say. I suspect, too, that the pre-Budget report rather than the events of 11 September accounts for that three-month delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite prepared to make an acknowledgement to the Minister. Having been a member of such a Committee for five years, between 1992 and 1997, I concede that the sin of delay has not been freshly minted by the present Administration. However, whether we have a Labour or a Conservative Government, it is wrong for the convenience of the Executive to be put before the opportunity of Members of Parliament to scrutinise important European documents. I hope that matters will be improved in future.

That delay is of more than passing importance because it raises serious questions about the relevance of many of the assumptions made by the Commission and the Council in these papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned during Question Time, the Commission forecast that growth in the eurozone for 2001–02 would be about 2.75 per cent. However, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
most recent edition of the EU economy review of 2001, published by the Commission on its website, argues that there has been a rapid and continuous deterioration in short-term economic prospects in the second half of 2001. The review states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Growth in both 2001 and 2002 is foreseen to be considerably below potential. The unexpectedly sharp downturn and the lack of resilience pose important policy challenges."</p></blockquote>
It adds that, in the second quarter of 2001,
	<br><blockquote><p>"GDP growth came to a virtual standstill"</p></blockquote>
and predicts that
	<br><blockquote><p>"growth can be expected to be disappointingly low in 2002."</p></blockquote>
Those statements were made by the Commission, and they must have some impact on the policy prescriptions embodied in the guidelines that we are discussing today. I therefore, hope that in her response to the debate the Minister will be more forthcoming in explaining how the Government and our partners in the European Union plan to respond, perhaps by amending the guidelines in the light of dramatically changed economic circumstances, because the Government themselves have admitted that things have changed markedly. The pre-Budget report states, on page 141 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"economic activity in the euro area has been much weaker than expected at Budget 2001."</p></blockquote>
Table A4 on the same page of the pre-Budget report shows that the British Government have reduced their own forecasts for GDP growth in the eurozone for both 2001 and 2002. Whereas, at the time of the last Budget, when the guidelines were drafted in Brussels, the British Government were predicting eurozone growth of 2.7 per cent. in 2001 and 2.9 per cent. in 2002, by the time of the pre-Budget report the Government had shaded down those forecasts to 1.5 per cent. growth in each of those two years—a significant decrease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent figures suggest that matters may have deteriorated further. 	<i>The Economist</i> of 5 January 2002 referred to growth forecasts of 1.5 per cent. for 2001, falling to 1 per cent. in 2002. One immediate likely impact of that deteriorating growth is a worsening in the budgetary positions of different countries, which will, in turn, affect considerably their ability to comply with their commitments under the stability and growth pact. We only have available to us the projections for UK borrowing in the pre-Budget report, but I find it interesting to compare the projections for UK borrowing as a percentage of GDP that the Government have published in the pre-Budget report with the equivalent predictions embodied in these guidelines, which date back some nine months and were presumably supplied to the Commission by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forecasts for public finances have grown worse during the intervening period. I shall not test your patience, Miss Widdecombe, by reciting the figures for each of the six years but, to take two examples, nine months ago the guidelines documents projected a British borrowing requirement of 0.1 per cent. for 2002–03. The figure in the pre-Budget report is 1.1 per cent. of GDP. For 2003–04 the forecast borrowing requirement has risen from 0.9 per cent. to 1.3 per cent. of GDP. I could give other illustrations.

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The worsening of the economic climate has implications that go beyond the domestic economy and the levers of policy available to the Government in Westminster. We are discussing a community of countries that includes our major trading partners. If their economies run into serious difficulties, that is bad news for British business, particularly our exporters. The difficulties over growth, in Germany in particular, bode ill for the economic prospects of the whole EU and therefore for the British companies that rely upon trade with those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A broader concern about Germany is pointed out in a recent report on the introduction of the euro, published by 	<i>The Economist</i> on 5 January. It quotes Commission forecasts that Germany's budget deficit will be 2.7 per cent. of GDP in 2002. That is very close to the 3 per cent. ceiling beyond which Germany might face the lunatic prospect of being fined for failing to keep its public finances in order. There are serious questions about the stability of the pact, and what the implications of that might be for British economic prospects this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is much in the broad economic policy guidelines that my hon. Friends and I would be happy to accept as embodying sensible economic policies. We still disagree with the Government over the extent to which those policies should be worked out at a supranational rather than at a national level. However, I am clear that structural economic reform in the major economies of continental Europe would be in Britain's interests. We have seen an example of some of the problems that arise from restrictive German retail laws in the last couple of days. The Minister spoke of the need to develop a single market in financial services, and she is right to stress that. I also support her call for labour markets to be further liberalised, although I question whether that fits well with the Government's support for the social chapter system and the fact that, for example, the working time directive is likely to be extended to the offshore industry within the next year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister's remarks about the need to reinforce competition. The Government have signed up to a commitment to reinforce competition by accelerating liberalisation in the railway industry, among others. That could lead to heartache among several of the Minister's right hon. and hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has touched on a point that I hope to raise. Has railway liberalisation in Britain been a total disaster, and are successful railways state-owned and unified systems? It would be a disaster for European countries to be persuaded to follow our route, just as the process has been disastrous for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to make his criticisms, although I draw his attention to the fact that passenger numbers and investment increased significantly following privatisation, whatever the flaws in the method that was adopted. However, his Government have signed up to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
objective of reinforcing competition in the railway industry and accelerating liberalisation. I get the impression that while the Minister will be attending Council meetings and agreeing objectives, the hon. Gentleman will be warming his hands on the brazier outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will attend European meetings and say, "Hang on, we've tried this and it doesn't actually work. Shouldn't we put it to one side?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be astonished if a European country examined what the Government have done to the rail industry over the past couple of months and regarded it as an example that they wished to emulate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Farrelly 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past, one country did examine what happened in the United Kingdom—namely Germany—and promptly shelved its plans to privatise its railways because of the experience that the Conservative Government inflicted on this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is arguing for railway renationalisation rather than the reorganisation of a private system, he is entitled to make that case. However, the present Government do not appear to be persuaded of it and they have signed up to broad economic policy guidelines from Europe that would be breached if they were tempted down the route that is advocated by several of their Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate my remarks on the various references in the documents to taxation and expenditure, while allowing time for other hon. Members to speak. The references show clearly that despite the soothing words that we hear from Treasury Ministers, the ambition of the Commission and the open and honourable objectives of a fair number of our EU partners are that taxation, borrowing and public expenditure should be treated not only as matters for peer review—to use the Minister's phrase—but matters for which policy should be set at a European rather than national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke with great pride about the Government's success in putting the Commission back in its box and removing the reference to the particular borrowing figures for the UK economy from the broad economic policy guidelines. However, the Minister did not explain to the Committee the full scope of the Commission's ambitions. It is interesting to examine the imperative tone of the original Commission document in respect of not only the United Kingdom but several other member states, and to compare those original Commission recommendations with the document that was subsequently agreed by the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission said that Britain should ensure that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"ratio of public sector current expenditure to GDP should not exceed … 37.3 per cent".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
It told Denmark that it needed to reduce the real growth in Government consumption to 1.9 per cent. of GDP in 2001, and to ensure
	<br><blockquote><p>"that primary expenditure falls to a level that is not more than 49.5 per cent of GDP"</p></blockquote>
in 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sweden was told that it had to continue the strategy of reducing taxes on lower and medium wage earners to
	<br><blockquote><p>"achieve in 2001 a general government surplus consistent with the 2000 updated convergence programme projection of 3.5 per cent of GDP".</p></blockquote>
Ireland was told to
	<br><blockquote><p>"remove the inconsistency with the 2000"</p></blockquote>
broad economic policy guidelines, and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"prepare a budget for 2002 that contributes to an orderly easing of the pace of demand".</p></blockquote>
Even a country as loyally signed up to the European project as Austria was informed that it had to
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce the high tax burden",</p></blockquote>
to review benefit levels and invalidity pensions, and to implement
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional and permanent expenditure savings".</p></blockquote>
Spain was told to
	<br><blockquote><p>"increase the public pension fund reserve…to at least 1 per cent of GDP by 2004".</p></blockquote>
Italy—and there have been a couple of disagreements between its Government and the Commission recently—has been asked to
	<br><blockquote><p>"achieve in 2001 a general government deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP",</p></blockquote>
and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"match any loss of revenue stemming from additional reductions of taxes and social security contributions with offsetting expenditure cuts".</p></blockquote>
That list makes it clear that the Commission now sees itself as the driver of economic policy in the new European community that is emerging following the introduction of the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council amended some—but not all—of those recommendations. It made the change in relation to the United Kingdom to which the Minister has referred, and it removed references to specific borrowing figures for Denmark and Sweden. It is instructive to note that the Commission was either prepared or forced to change its original draft most dramatically in respect of the three countries that have not signed up to the euro, and which, no doubt, it hopes can be persuaded to sign up to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's remarks with great interest and entertainment. Is he not suggesting that those countries are better at running their economies than the European Commission, because they are three of the most successful economies in the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made that point well. My criticism is not that the policy prescriptions advocated by the Commission in respect of member states must, necessarily, be wrong—and it is not for me to make a judgment about that with regard to any country except the United Kingdom—but that the Governments of each country, accountable to their electorates through their national institutions, should
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
have the primary responsibility to take decisions about such matters, and to be held to account—and if necessary got rid of—by their electorates for the results that they deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council document proposes the changes to which I have referred in respect of the three countries that are outside the eurozone, and its references to Ireland were toned down, but only slightly. The document still contains the message that because Ireland has signed up to the single currency, it must take fiscal measures to rein back inflation, as it can no longer use the exchange rate as a tool in its monetary policy to manage the national economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references to the policies of Austria, Italy and Spain remain as originally drafted by the European Commission. They suggest that the Commission thinks that for the purposes of tax, borrowing and public expenditure, the eurozone countries are to be treated as part of a single market, with the Commission driving policy forward as it intended to in the single market as originally envisaged. That is an important revelation gained from the documents and from the contrast between the two drafts before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not pretend that the leaders of many other European countries do not share the ambitions of the Commission. When I listened to the reactions of European leaders to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January, I was struck by the fact that they welcomed the currency as a great step toward European political integration. Whenever I have had conversations with politicians from Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere, they have been open, unabashed, honest and honourable about sharing those ambitions. I wish that British politicians who are keen to join the single currency had the grace to admit that there is an important political agenda behind what is falsely presented as a purely economic decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must add the scattered references to other forms of taxation to the Commission's statements about tax, borrowing and expenditure. These matters were incorporated, albeit in some instances with qualification, into the European Council guidelines. Page 21 of the Council document mentions value added tax systems. In response to an intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), the Minister said that it was not the Government's policy to allow British zero rating to be removed. What do the Government hope will happen as a result of their commitment to simplifying and ensuring a more uniform application of VAT systems?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is reviewing the application of VAT throughout the European Community and will perhaps produce a report in 2003. I infer from references in the guidelines that the Commission would like to scrap or reduce the scope of zero rating; it signed up to that aim some time ago. Let me accept the Minister's assurance that the Government's policy on the matter has changed. What, then, is the Government's interpretation of the commitment on VAT into which they have now entered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar issue arises on energy taxation, which is mentioned on page 25 of the Council document. The Minister said that the provisions allow for sensible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
initiatives that the Government are happy to explore, such as pan-European emissions trade-offs. The hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) also made reassuring comments. However, if we look at the text, rather than engaging in wishful thinking, we see that the 15 Governments have signed up to an objective of enhancing environmental sustainability, which I am sure that every member of this Committee supports, and to five specific measures, prefaced by the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore, it is necessary to:".</p></blockquote>
A clear separation exists between matters such as emissions trading, on the one hand, and taxation, on the other. The second point states that it is necessary to
	<br><blockquote><p>"introduce and strengthen market-based policies like taxation, user and polluter charges, insurance/liability schemes and tradable emission rights",</p></blockquote>
which would appear to cover the Minister's point. The fourth point refers to intensifying
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of economic instruments to curb greenhouse gas emissions",</p></blockquote>
which, too, might be relevant to the Minister's comments. However, the fifth point refers separately to the necessity to
	<br><blockquote><p>"agree on an appropriate framework for energy taxation at the European level and for the creation of a single internal market for energy."</p></blockquote>
That is the statement to which the British Government have agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do the Government think that they have signed us up to doing? I am sure that there will be other voices, not just in the Commission but in other member states, who would wish to see a common tax regime for energy throughout the European Union, and who could make a logical case for that. Such a pan-European system would mark a significant extension of EU competence over matters hitherto reserved to member states, and, if it were introduced, set an important precedent for further matters of taxation to be brought under the remit of European institutions at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, especially as I missed the introductory part of his comments. Does he agree that the fifth point relates to the general comments on page 24 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States should set clear targets and timetables for environmental policies so that business and consumers can adjust smoothly…Establishing a framework…at Community level could help avoid such distortions and underpin the internal market."</p></blockquote>
When I worked in management for a multinational company, one of the major obstacles to trade was the difference in the system of different countries, rather than the difference in the taxation level. Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that most businesses would welcome a recognisable similarity of approach across the European Union, while respecting national differences and levels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a case for doing what the hon. Gentleman is advocating. If that is in the national interest of the United Kingdom, I would expect the Government to consider it as a policy. However, two issues still arise. First, would such a
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
limited extension of European oversight of energy taxation introduce, in practice, European competence over this area of policy? That would amount to the thin end of the wedge, which could be used as a precedent on which to build greater European intervention in energy taxation matters in the future. Secondly, the fifth point, on page 25, appears, to my eyes, to be much more ambitious than the limited proposals to which he alluded on the previous page. It might be interpreted as a commitment to go a good deal further than the hon. Gentleman advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On taxation, I draw the Minister's attention to page 16 of the Council document and a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the objective of pursuing tax co-ordination "further"—an important word—
	<br><blockquote><p>"so as to avoid harmful tax competition".</p></blockquote>
The language of the Minister's response to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood was reassuring, but what do the Government regard as "harmful tax competition"? What sort of further tax co-ordination do they want to pursue? What sort of further tax co-ordination have they committed themselves to pursuing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the document contains much that Opposition Members welcome as sensible economic policies for Britain and the wider European Union, we remain worried about the extent to which the commitments into which the Government have entered allow scope for European institutions to cite, if not immediately, in future, precedents for a significant further extension of the competence of supranational institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the mild sense of frustration apparently felt by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. We are debating a document that is several months old. I understand why it has reached us so late, but I should like to ensure that ways can be found of presenting such documents to us sooner, so that we are not considering something that may be historical rather than a reflection of the current state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return briefly to the question of regional economic divides. My area, the Thames valley, has more in common economically with greater Frankfurt or greater Milan than with Merseyside, for example. The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) referred to difficulties in Wales despite its receipt of objective 1 funding. I suspect that those difficulties might be exacerbated, rather than alleviated, with future enlargement and the entry of more, relatively impoverished, countries into the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the statements made, on page 68 of the Council document, about the UK labour market an opportunity has been missed. The Council praises active measures targeting long-term and strategic unemployment and urges the reinforcement of those measures to target
	<br><blockquote><p>"communities and individuals most prone to the risk of concentrated or long-term unemployment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
That is extremely good, but concentrated or long-term unemployment barely exists in the Thames valley, which does not mean that the Thames valley has no difficulties. When broad economic policy guidelines are presented to us, might we not learn from other regions in Europe about how they tackle difficulties resulting from low unemployment and high economic activity, of traffic congestion or pressure on infrastructure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. Does she agree that the European Union would do well to transfer far more resources into regional policy and to enable fiscal transfers between regions of the European Union such that the less prosperous regions can be helped and those that may be overheating can be damped down? The emphasis should be on fiscal transfers rather than market mechanisms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We should not continue with the current situation. In my constituency we import bus drivers from Wales, many of whom are former steelworkers, resulting in pressure on public services. Individuals in my constituency who lose their job are out of work for 10 days, although in other places the length of time is much longer. Such individuals may have to move away from my constituency to find affordable housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key advantage of membership of and active participation in the EU is that it is possible to have certain types of exchanges and examine regional economies in a way that I suspect we are not doing. Will the Minister consider the matter with her hon. Friends and colleagues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.11pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should have debated the guidelines between the publication of the Commission's original proposals and the endorsement of them, as modified, by the European Council. That is the correct procedure and I hope that the House will follow it in future, although I understand the specific electoral circumstances and the intervention of the summer recess in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wholeheartedly against the process whereby we mirror the economic policies pursued in the EU as a whole. That is against the British interest. I do not feel that Treasury time is best served by trips to Brussels, hotel bills, Eurostar and business class air fares, when its attention should be wholly focused on improving the living standards of the British people. That is the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I voted against the stability pact, which will, like the whole of the Maastricht process, lead to the creation of a superstate. We are witnessing the economic ingredients of the process of integration towards such a superstate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman's vote for instability mean that he is relaxed about other countries in the EU not following the same kind of prudent policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the interests of each member country of the EU to pursue policies that best serve the interests of its people. It is as simple as that. If those countries have good effective Governments, they will so do. They will wish to maximise capital flows, trade and movement of people between their respective countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) put it well when he said that such an approach to economic management had inherent accountability—a democratic element—that is missing, to a degree, when the driver is the EU Commission in Brussels, over which we have little control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's view that the best judge of a nation's economic policies should be the member state's Government because they are accountable to their electorate. Does he not agree that, particularly in the modern world, countries' economic policies cannot exist in isolation from those in the rest of the world? A better way forward would be to encourage the right economic policies in other member states and, indeed, in other nations throughout the world, and I would suggest co-ordinated reflation during the present downturn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much wisdom in the hon. Gentleman's proposal. I was suggesting that it would be better for the Treasury to focus on the British economy as a key component of the world economy. The Treasury should consider the global scene; although Europe is a significant part of that, it should not be the overwhelming determinant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two fundamental flaws in the stability pact. One is that it may be adhered to too rigidly, and the Minister referred to that when she lauded Her Majesty's Government for their counter-cyclical spending in this time of economic downturn. As the hon. Member for Luton, North noted, there is much merit in that, but, as the hon. Member for Broxtowe suggested, the stability pact could have an inherent deflationary impetus and constrain public expenditure when it should be relaxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If expenditure is relaxed too much, however, and the Italians or the Germans ignore the stability pact, there could be two malign consequences. First, capital flows could be needed to meet the deficit that was run up to fund Italian pension funds, Greek overspending or rebuilding in eastern Germany—those could all drive the process. Secondly, there could be a significant loss of confidence in the European Union's currency, the euro, which might have a significant effect on the international markets. I therefore have my reservations about the stability pact, but I shall not labour them further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission displayed breathtaking naivety when it failed to recognise, even in the spring, the imminent downturn in the United States and the gravity of the situation. That was O-level stuff. The bubble in information technology stocks was manifestly about to burst, with huge ramifications for the American economy. Only the size of American demand was supporting the global economy, but it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
could not have been maintained much longer. In the event, 11 September made the downturn very much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Commission brushed aside the Japanese decline, an economic phenomenon with the gravest consequences for the world economy, and particularly for Asia. The Pacific basin has had the highest growth in the world economy, but the depression in Japan and the fact that the country is on the verge of deflation are matters of grave consequence, which antedated the spring by many months and could have been foreseen then. The defects in the Japanese banking system and its level of exposure had perturbed people for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission also assumed that European Union countries could escape the worst consequences because of some inherent merit in the way in which we managed our economies. The Federal Republic of Germany is one of the main economies in the world and is dependent on exports. The manufacturing sector has been experiencing a depression for several months, a problem that started long before the Commission did its sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the documents were produced, we have had the events of 11 September, the Enron bust—the biggest single corporate failure in history—and now the Argentinian default and devaluation. That was the single biggest national default and an event of mammoth proportions for Latin America and perhaps further afield. The Spanish banking system and the nation's economic interests are feeling the consequences of a devaluation of about 30 per cent. We are discussing economic history, and it is not even good history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should we mirror our neighbours? How would it benefit Britain? I shall consider a few areas of the world. Look at the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Would Singapore have prospered if its policies had mirrored those of its bigger neighbour, Indonesia? Certainly not. The fact that Singapore broke away from the Malaysian federation and instituted its own currency and its own system of economic management led the country to prosper in a way that has hardly been emulated anywhere else. Look at east Asia. Would Taiwan have done any better if it had pursued the policies of its bigger continental neighbour, the People's Republic of China? What about Hong Kong? Even after its absorption into the People's Republic, following the hauling down of the British flag, it is still an economic zone pursuing different policies with a different currency, and that is manifestly to the benefit of the people of Hong Kong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman forgiving way again. I congratulate him on his prescience in market movements and on his doubtless having become a multi-millionaire in short-selling information technology stocks earlier this year. Based on the arguments that he has advanced for other countries, would he favour a separate currency for Ruislip-Northwood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue with my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about America de Sud? Chile wisely decided not to become a member, but its associate membership has helped it to balance its trade rather well, as it is not focused entirely on Latin America. If Chile had pursued the policies of its neighbour Argentina and pegged its peso to the dollar, Chile would now be bust. As it is, Chile is very resilient; it is prospering, and even at this time of world economic decline its private pension funds are still manifesting growth. Those are interesting facts. Also interesting is the fact that Chile, with a number of other smaller polities such as New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland, is in the Heritage Foundation list of the ten freest countries in the world—and by and large those countries have the best economic performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government should concentrate on enhancing tax competition. We should do everything in our power to ensure the lowest tax regimes in Britain if not in the global economy. That is how we should encourage growth and stimulate job creation. It would lead to greater entrepreneurship in the economy. We should not pursue the statist, corporatist, high-spending policies that are largely followed on the continent. The debate has been an interesting exercise and a fascinating insight into the thinking, such as it is, of the European Commission, but I hope that the Government do not follow it too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say what a pleasure it is, Miss Widdecombe, to serve under your chairmanship? You may not recall it, but my maiden speech four or five years ago followed your wonderful speech in the hunting debate. Your contribution was a veritable tour de force, with which I wholly agreed. My modest speech provided an interesting introduction to speaking in the Chamber. It is a pleasure to be debating the economy once again with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. I genuinely enjoy these debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about budget deficits in the European Union, but it is a shame that we should be debating an historic document that no longer relates to current circumstances. It would be much more interesting if we could debate the next report sooner after its publication. We are into a new era. Serious difficulties are arising for the European Union and its economic strategy, which is exhibited by the fact that budget deficits are increasing. The constraints of the stability and growth pact are being tested and will be tested further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent article draws attention to the national economic and social research forecasts of budget deficits until 2004. It suggests that the global deficit for the EU will increase from about 0.5 per cent. of GDP to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
1.25 percent. of GDP—a significant increase—and that some countries are already "surfing close to the limits". I am not concerned about that because I think that the limits are too low. In periods of world recession, such as that which we are entering, it is right for governments to run substantial deficits in order to reflate their economies. Consider the periods of recession in wartime, when governments borrow enormous sums of money. America is a classic example. It had the strongest economy in the world. Straight after the second world war it borrowed for years as though there were no tomorrow and created an enormously strong economy on the basis of that borrowing. That is interesting, but I shall not dwell on it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are on the verge of a fairly serious world recession. There is much speculation as to whether or not we shall escape it. The European Union is looking into a possible black hole, and we must address that. Nothing will create more scepticism about the EU than if it fails economically and its citizens see not only their jobs disappear but their living standards severely damaged. There is already a degree of scepticism in Italy, as we have seen. That could increase. Ireland is fortunate in that it entered the eurozone with a substantial cut in interest rates and its currency was relatively undervalued, which means that it has a booming economy; its inflation is slightly higher than that of other countries, but not seriously so. That proves my point that when interest rates are reduced and public spending is increased, with the right exchange rates, there can be a booming economy. It is embarrassing that there is a small economy near to us, peripheral to Europe, that is doing well because it entered with beneficial macro-economic conditions. Other countries might not have that advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look ahead a year or two, we might see some countries in the eurozone suffering difficulties. A small country like Ireland, which represents 1 percent. of the EU population, is not significant. However, a large economy, say Germany, represents a much larger proportion of the population and the economy of the EU. If it gets into serious trouble, its citizens may want to reflate and spend more public money, but they will come up against the growth and stability pact limits. They will not be permitted to cut interest rates because those are not determined by the German Government. What will they do? If that economy agrees to stay within the constraints of the EU's economic arrangements, it will go into recession and will drag the rest of the EU down with it. That will then be a serious matter. We can deal with small economies having problems; a big economy having a problem like that is a major issue. We must look seriously at how we should move forward and escape from what I regard as fiscal anorexia arising from the current pact and economic arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European growth is too low, and European unemployment is still too high. Britain, being outside the eurozone, must provide some intelligent input into the debate about the future of European economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I will speak briefly about the serious issue of the liberalisation of the railways. I hope that it will be left to flap in the wind and that no one will take it seriously. I recently went on a railway visit to France with the House of Commons all-party railway group. We met French railway engineers from SNCF, who did not take liberalisation seriously. They could see the problems occurring in Britain. French railways are light years ahead of our railways. They are state owned and, at this stage at least, they form an integrated, whole system. That is the way forward. While we were there, we discussed PPP. The engineers said that when people in France referred to PPP, they meant public, public, public. I have strong sympathies with SNCF on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious economic problems for the future in Europe. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has left the Room because he said that we needed more tax competition and lower public spending. It is interesting that some of the countries with the highest taxes—Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweden—and the highest levels of public spending are also the most successful economies in Europe. Many people in Europe would give their eye teeth for the public services and living standards in those countries. Europe would do well to imitate what has traditionally been done in those, dare I say, social democratic countries of northern Europe, and follow the way in which they have managed their economies. Some of them do not have the advantages of oil or other natural resources. They live by their wits and the added value that they create in their countries through manufacturing and services. We should follow those examples, rather than the deflationist examples set by countries in the eurozone, exemplified at their most extreme in Commission publications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe must listen more to its citizens. We want lower unemployment and more jobs. To achieve that, we need expansionist policies, not deflation. The Commission and European Union are obsessed with the past and with inflation. I hesitate to say that inflation is absolutely dead, but it is no longer a serious issue. Indeed, I suggest that some of the targets set for inflation are too low. If one has a low target for inflation, one may move towards the situation in Japan, where citizens anticipate reductions in prices and therefore defer purchases, which reinforces deflation. With a little inflation, there is always the knowledge that it is probably better to buy now rather than next year because prices will be higher next year. A little inflation is the oil that helps the economy to run. If one becomes too obsessed with reducing inflation to extremely low levels, one can fall into the Japanese trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between inflation of 2.5 per cent., 3 per cent. or 3.5 per cent. is insignificant, especially when exchange rates are fluctuating by vast amounts—30 per cent. in the case of the euro. Clearly, high inflation such as occurred in the 1970s is serious, but minor changes are not. We could set a target in Europe or in the UK that is somewhat higher than the present target and it would do no damage to our economy. The important thing is to ensure that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
demand and employment are sustained and that growth and investment continue. Those issues require serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Farrelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood has left the Room because I wanted to congratulate him on the fistful of euros that he had in his hand during the debate—I see that he has now reappeared. Those euros are the first that I have seen since Parliament reconvened. However, sadly, it seems from his remarks that his mind is obviously not as open to Europe as his wallet is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was looking at the euros and wondering whether Gresham's law would apply to them, as they are such a scruffy set of notes. In history, the value of a currency, the power of an economy or the strength of an empire has often been reflected in the quality of its currency. I suspect that that will be the same for the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Farrelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. When I saw the notes slip back into his wallet, I thought that they looked rather crisp and neat. I encourage him to try to spend them in the bar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her reply, my hon. Friend the Minister will say that it is a fallacy to suggest that we cannot serve our own interests by co-operating with and visiting Europe. We serve our own interests by doing exactly that, because Europe is our main trading partner. The sort of remarks with which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood opened his speech represent isolationism and myopia of the worst sort. I sympathise with the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, who asked whether the hon. Gentleman would consider a currency for Ruislip-Northwood in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the taxation precedent, but I think that he over-egged them. After all, the broad economic policy guidelines are advisory. Is he saying that Conservative Ministers would not hear advice from anyone on economic policy, whether people or bodies inside or outside the country? If so, perhaps that is why the Labour Government inherited the country and its infrastructure in such a wretched state in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cited the example of a potential precedent on energy taxation. Surely he concedes that taxation was an important consideration in any single market for goods or commodities. I note that he has not produced a list of single markets that he would rule in or out. As an example, we could consider the case—pardon the pun—of the Scotch Whisky Association. I am sure that it would be grateful for the promotion of a market in which tax harmonisation was a central feature. Should Opposition Members not keep a more open mind on such matters, and treat them on a case-by-case basis? They may find that they benefit their constituents and the country by doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard some interesting points in debate today, many of which were entertaining. Before addressing some of the issues, it might be useful for me to remind hon. Members of the motion, which asks the Committee to support
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's welcome for the publication of the Guidelines in giving operational content to the conclusions of the Lisbon and Stockholm summits, in reflecting the importance of structural reform in tackling successfully the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, and in promoting employment and social inclusion".</p></blockquote>
Due to this sitting of the Committee, the United Kingdom will be enabled to make an effective contribution to economic policy co-ordination in the European Union, including the promotion of economic reform in the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury, among others, criticised the length of time that it has taken for the debate to take place. I apologise for any influence that the Government have had on that delay, and I want to make some points that the Committee may find interesting. Since the broad economic policy guidelines were agreed, the process of a general election inevitably caused an interruption, as has been widely recognised. During that interval, the Treasury sent an unsigned explanatory memorandum to the Clerks of the Committee to set out the broad thrust of the economic guidelines. It was sent on 4 June, at one of the earliest opportunities. As the Minister responsible, I sent a signed explanatory memorandum that took members of the Committee through the points made in the guidelines only two days after the Committee was reconvened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would add in response to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the Government may have something to hide, that in the explanatory memorandum published in June 2001 we emphasised that we had managed to have the recommendation on our public expenditure removed from the broad economic policy guidelines because we felt that it exceeded the remit of the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have nothing to hide. We think that the process of multilateral surveillance, of which the broad economic policy guidelines form a significant part, is important in the process of learning from other member states in an EU context. We see the commitment towards economic and structural reform as vital components of our economic strategy and we are pleased that the rest of the EU also accepts that. We would like to encourage the process to gain in momentum so that we increasingly learn from best practice in other countries and from peer review. The process has a lot to offer the UK and other EU Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Parliament was reconvened, it took some time to arrange this debate. However, the events of 11 September put unusual pressure on parliamentary time. I would emphasise that personally I welcome the process of parliamentary scrutiny. Had it been possible to arrange an earlier date, I would have welcomed the opportunity to come the Committee and engage in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury made much of the fact that the delay in holding this debate made the forecasts out of date and weakened its purpose. However, I would emphasise that our most recent projections, as well as the broad economic guidelines, show that the UK's public finance position and projections are well within the Maastricht criteria. There is no question of us not meeting the Maastricht criteria and it is widely recognised that our public finances are in a prudent and sustainable position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to quote the statement of the December 2001 IMF article IV mission on the UK, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In terms of prudence, cyclically adjusted overall deficits of about 1 per cent. of GDP over the medium term would not compromise the strong, underlying fiscal position achieved in the late 1990s, as highlighted by the projected stability of the public debt ratio at a modest level of 31 per cent. of GDP".</p></blockquote>
We foresee that that ratio will continue for some years to come at around that level. Although we recognise that there has been significant change in the external climate since the guidelines were drawn up, the UK still comfortably fulfils the criteria and any prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact. In the spring, the new economic outlook will be taken into consideration and debated as part of this year's round of multilateral surveillance. The process will once again come up for debate at the EU level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much mention of the stability and growth pact itself and issues such as the German deficit. I will not, at this stage, get into a detailed discussion of that pact. I recognise that at 2.7 per cent. of GDP, the German deficit is quite close to the 3 per cent. laid down, but I do not think that it would be fruitful, in advance of discussions that will take place at EU level, to get into a detailed discussion of how we think the pact should be interpreted. It is important, however, that the pact is interpreted in a sensible and prudent way that takes account of the need for public investment and the use of the automatic stabilisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Aylesbury supports the Government's objectives of promoting labour market reform, competition and the liberalisation of the financial services market. I would emphasise that these objectives are more important in a deteriorating economic climate than they were even 12 months ago. However, as he made so much of the references in the report to liberalisation in the transport sector, I should say a few words on that subject. It is worth pointing out that the United Kingdom has one of the most liberalised railway systems in Europe, and that liberalisation has gone so far and was done so haphazardly—to put it charitably—that there is much to correct in that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's preferred private successor to Railtrack will continue the process of liberalisation, but it will be much more focused. There will be a far more efficient delivery of infrastructure investment within that framework, and more co-operation with the private sector train operating companies and maintenance companies to ensure that the needs and interests of rail passengers are put first. The process of granting the train operating franchises is highly
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
competitive and fully focused on delivering better passenger services. I emphasise that the franchises come up for reletting in the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic guidelines specifically recommend that the investment that the Government announced in their 10-year plan should be delivered. The guidelines recommend that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is adequate co-ordination between different public bodies, regulators and private firms."</p></blockquote>
That is a lesson that has been hard learned, and one for which the previous Conservative Administration were responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury referred to taxation and expenditure and made various references to the comments in the report on VAT structures. I hardly need to say to him that tax is a matter of national competence and should be determined at member state level. We have in no way jeopardised or interfered with our right to set tax at a national level by signing up to the broad economic policy guidelines. We retain a national veto over taxation measures and will continue to argue that there should be no greater tax harmonisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines are non-binding on member states. As part of the policy of multilateral surveillance, they are an important part of the process of learning from each other. The Commission's recommendations are produced for all countries and areas to be debated by Governments of member states. The Council of Ministers, not the Commission, has the final say on the content of documents such as the broad guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says about the national veto remaining over taxation, but the opening statement in the Council document concludes by saying that the Council "hereby recommends" the contents of the Council guidelines. Surely the Government, in agreeing to those recommendations, is putting its name to specific proposals that in the EU there should be greater efforts towards simplifying VAT systems and to introducing some framework for common energy taxation? What do the Government want to come out of those commitments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman took the opportunity to raise those issues, as I am about to comment on them. I re-emphasise that the Council is made up of democratically elected representatives who have the opportunity for full debate on those issues. The recommendations are non-binding and are made in the spirit of debate and learning from each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take VAT systems as an example of the proposition made by the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made some interesting comments on simplifying the framework and co-ordinating our approach to matters while leaving rates to national decisions. That is an appropriate way to tackle systems whose application in one country will create an impact in others. Global accounting standards come to mind. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would argue about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
legitimacy of setting standards at supranational level and I am sure that he would agree that it is desirable to set frameworks at European Union level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK has a positive attitude towards measures to simplify VAT administration costs across the Community. We welcome changes that would reduce administration costs and thereby help British business. Of course we would not surrender our right to set VAT rates. We hold that dear, as the hon. Gentleman knows. He mentioned energy taxes and, again, we approach those in a spirit of co-operation. We would not accept any imposition from Brussels on our national sovereignty on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that the energy products directive, which is currently under negotiation, would not force any increase in UK taxes. We would never agree to one that did. However, it might mean that other member states would choose to follow in our footsteps and implement some of the measures that we have already undertaken in the United Kingdom, such as the climate change levy and consideration of forms of emissions trading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a big difference between the imposed European policy and a co-ordinated European policy involving voluntary agreement on join action, especially in the energy market, in which there is already substantial transfer of energy between countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. Of course, the energy products directive, for example, would require unanimity and we would have a veto. Therefore, that would be a clear example of a decision to engage in a co-operative fashion with other member states, rather than having anything imposed onus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East made a point, clearly and well, about regional economic divides, and about the Government's responsibility to try to tackle regional inequality and ensure that this country's regions have the opportunity to grow, develop and improve their productivity. We could then tap the potential of every individual in the country, not just those who happen to live in a prosperous region or area. As part of that process it is of course important to learn from best practice in other EU member states. I should dearly like that process to develop. The broad economic policy guidelines, as well as, for instance, the Cardiff process and the Luxembourg process on the labour market, are important elements of such learning from member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made some perhaps predictable economic points, although with interesting reference to the state of affairs in different countries. I see no parallel between countries with fixed exchange rates in other parts of the world and the situation here in the framework of the European Union. We should not spend too long wondering whether it is wise to travel to Brussels to learn from our European neighbours. It is essential to learn from best practice in the rest of the world, not just, of course, in the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North made an interesting contribution. He noted the deteriorating economic climate and the fact that budget deficits are increasing throughout the world. As I said, I do not want to get into a detailed discussion of the stability and growth pact, but I take note of the points that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At times such as this, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that we have the most competitive and productive European economy, to boost growth and jobs and to push forward the European economic and structural agenda. We must ensure that we have a flexible economy that can respond to external shocks. The process before us is part of the programme to ensure that we translate previous agreements at European Councils into policies on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact will lead to sustainability in the economic cycle and to an important role for the development of public investment. That is particularly relevant to countries such as the UK, which have a legacy of chronic underinvestment, which we must rectify. The UK is tackling its historic legacy of underinvestment, but has ensured that net debt levels remain low. That is a sign of our commitment to prudent public finances and part of our general fiscal and economic framework. We are committed to a completely prudent economic approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reiterate, the process before us is important, and I am happy to debate it. By promoting economic growth across Europe, we shall bring employment growth to Britain and, indeed, to other member states. We shall boost productivity, growth and the number of jobs. That is why I urge the Committee to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
