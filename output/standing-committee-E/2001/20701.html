Third-country Nationals</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>[Relevant Documents: European Union Document No. 8237/01 relating to the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents, European Union Document No. 11803/01 relating to the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities, and European Union Document No. 10865/01 relating to freedom to travel for third-country nationals within the territory of the member states.]</i></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government welcomed the communication on a Community immigration policy as a first response to the call by the European Council at Tampere for an approximation of national laws on the conditions for admission and residence of third-country nationals. The Government support the proposition that immigration policies must be transparent, rational and flexible. A common set of high-level objectives in line with the United Kingdom's own objective to develop migration policy in the interests of social inclusion and sustainable economic growth is to be welcomed.<br><br>
The Tampere European Council called for long-term resident third-country nationals to be granted
<br><blockquote><p>"a set of uniform rights which are as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens".</p></blockquote>
The Government endorse the principle of fair treatment for third-country nationals. We support measures to ensure that the rights of long-term, legally resident third-country nationals are broadly comparable with those of member states' own nationals within their country of residence. That helps to encourage integration within the host community.<br><br>
The current arrangements in the UK already meet that test, and are in some respects more generous than those proposed in the draft directives. The Government strongly believe that, when people are settled here, they should be given every assistance to integrate fully in both their interests and those of society at large. However, the Tampere conclusions referred to rights within the member state of residence. The directives go beyond that by conferring rights throughout all member states. That is one source of the Government's difficulty with the proposals. We wish to maintain discretion over the admission of third-country nationals and the circumstances of their stay. That means that there would need to be substantial amendments to the present proposals before we could consider opting in. In particular, the directives would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
need to be far less prescriptive and move a long way in the direction of providing a flexible common framework. That is particularly the case in relation to the draft directive concerning the status of long-term resident third-country nationals.<br><br>
The Government's policy announced to Parliament in March 1999 is to look positively at participation in title IV measures, provided that the measure in question is consistent with our policy of retaining frontier controls and discretion as to the persons to be admitted to our territory. We make a decision on each proposed measure on its merits in light of that policy. We are keen to co-operate with our European partners. We shall continue to play an active part in the discussions of all proposals made in response to the Tampere conclusions. Even when we do not participate in particular measures from the outset, we shall take an active part in negotiations with a view to opting in if we are able to secure the necessary amendments, and will in any case seek to ensure that our policies are not unnecessarily out of step with those of our EU partners.<br><br>
I shall now take the opportunity to provide a brief outline of the Government's position on the draft directives. The draft directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of paid employment and self-employment contains proposals for a common legal framework for dealing with third-country nationals who want to enter a member state to work or engage in self-employment. Within that framework, member states would introduce national legislation to provide the precise terms on which a person would enter.<br><br>
The central proposals are for a joint residence and work permit to be processed together and for a transparent core set of rights and obligations on people who enter a member state. As the Scrutiny Committee was told last December, the United Kingdom decided not to opt in to that directive.<br><br>
The UK welcomes the aim of producing a transparent framework for the entry and stay of third-country nationals. The draft directive is compatible with many aspects of the UK's existing immigration rules. None the less, the UK has concerns about some of the draft articles. In particular, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue have fundamental objections to draft article 11·3 and its legal base. They have said that they would want to seek its removal before the UK could consider a future opt-in to the directive.<br><br>
The UK has the opportunity to opt in following the adoption of the directive. Meanwhile, officials are participating fully in the relevant working group discussions on the text, which began in March 2002. In total, three meetings have now been held. During those discussions, it emerged that many member states have similar reservations to those of the UK.<br><br>
The draft directive on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents would require the granting of long-term-resident status to all third-country nationals who reside legally in the member state's territory for five years. Having achieved that status, long-term residents would benefit from many of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the same rights as European Union citizens. We have little problem with that, but the draft directive also gives long-term residents the right to reside in a second member state and to transfer their long-term resident status to a second member state after five years' residence there. The draft directive would not significantly affect our policies in respect of third-country nationals who are long-term residents in the UK. The difficulty arises in respect of the provisions that grant rights in a second member state. If we were to opt in, we would be obliged to admit someone with that status, to allow them to exercise their rights under the directive.<br><br>
The Government have not opted into the third directive, which relates to the conditions under which third-country nationals who are legally present in a member state have the freedom to travel in member states' territory for periods not exceeding six months. It includes specific travel authorisation to determine the conditions of entry and movement for third-country nationals who plan to move in the territory of two or more member states for between three and six months.<br><br>
The directive is a development of the Schengen acquis on borders and visas, in which the UK does not participate. It would give third-country nationals who are lawfully present in other member states the right to enter another member state and remain in its territory for up to six months. That would affect the Government's ability to maintain discretion over the admission of third-country nationals.<br><br>
Little progress has been made on that draft directive. It is likely that a new measure will have to be drafted, as the Council legal service has determined that its legal base is inappropriate.<br><br>
The Spanish presidency of the visa working group, in which the measure was discussed, issued a questionnaire in order to establish member states' positions on matters such as who should be covered by the proposal; beneficiaries of the specific travel authorisation; member states in which the proposal can be applied; and whether the Schengen implementation convention needs to be amended. Member states submitted responses that exposed varying views on what they hope to achieve in that area of policy. Most are in favour of a regulation that would, under certain circumstances, allow for extensions to the three-month period in which a third-country national who meets specific conditions can travel freely within the member states. A consensus still needs to be reached and a new measure must be drafted.<br><br>
I have tried not to go on for too long, but I hope that I have given a run-in to the issues that we shall confront under the three directives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.30 pm for questions to the Minister. They should be brief and asked one at a time, as I am sure that they will be. It is likely that there will be ample opportunity for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cran. I have looked through the papers, and should like to turn
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
your attention to page xxxiii of the ninth report of the European Scrutiny Committee. The text at the bottom of the page would suggest that there is more, but on the reverse of the page, there is paragraph 9·1 of another document. I wonder whether you could take advice as to whether some of the conclusion is missing. If it is, could it be supplied as soon as possible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems perfectly clear that I cannot answer that question, although perhaps the Minister can answer it for us. I shall seek advice quickly and shall pass it on for the benefit of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Humfrey Malins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Woking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm on the record that the Government have no plans to opt in to any of the measures, and that they consider control over our borders to be a vital prerequisite to any future opt-ins?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's view that we should maintain discretion over our borders, and our ability to opt in to any of the measures, which might be quite positive in themselves, is governed by that policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which other countries have concerns about the draft directive? Are they among the richer or the poorer countries of the European Union?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is starting to get into a rather complex subject. There are three directives, and it is early days with regard to discussion on them. Many countries have raised different concerns. They do not necessarily share our concerns about the maintenance of border controls, but other issues are arising as the debate begins.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which countries have shown that they do not intend to implement the directives? What is the position of Denmark and Ireland on each of the three directives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ireland has the same policy as we do on discretion over borders. I shall try to clarify Denmark's views on the three directives before we finish our discussions today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister let us know—if not now, then perhaps later—how many third-country nationals in Europe might be eligible to benefit under directive 8237/01?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, it will have to be an estimate, but I will give that to the hon. Gentleman, if it is available. We are talking about the entire current membership of the European Union, but I will try to give him as accurate a figure as possible, before we finish today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why is the wording of the Government's motion so mild and cautious? I applaud their stance on the matter, but the wording is weaker than it is in our statement on the UK frontiers protocol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is not being clear about what his concerns are. The words are as they are: they cover the situation, and they maintain the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
position of our current policy. I am unsure what part of the motion he finds problematic. If he had pointed it out, I would have addressed it directly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following the question of the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), I want the Minister to tell us, after taking advice on the matter, how many people in the United Kingdom would be affected by these directives—either taken together or separately. There must have been an estimate of the numbers. Figures appear in the report, but they vary. It would be helpful to know how many people the Government believe are in the country who are non-EU nationals but have a right to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to give that information to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 38 of the explanatory notes to draft directive 8237 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The draft Directive would require the UK to give a (short-term) residence permit to those who had made fraudulent applications for long-term resident status".</p></blockquote>
I do not completely understand that sentence, although the words are fairly plain. Can the Minister explain what it means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In which directive is that paragraph?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to draft directive 8237, which addresses the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents. I find paragraph 38 confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, we maintain control of those who are resident in our country, as the hon. Gentleman knows. There are people who are legally resident in other parts of the EU, but who cannot reside in the UK. As the draft directive is currently worded, third-country nationals who are legally resident in other parts of the EU would have the right to come to the UK for periods of time, even if they had made a fraudulent application to enter the UK. Therefore, by accepting that directive, we would allow a breach of our ability to control our frontiers and who is legally present in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Scrutiny Committee makes its views clear, and refers to the views of others that have been communicated to it. Is it fair to interpret from the Committee's comments that the majority of representations received by it and the Government— and seen by both of them—are in favour of the directives? I am referring to the representations of those in the UK who have made their views about this matter clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are three separate directives. The situation is different with regard to each of them. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, when we find ourselves in a situation that allows us to use the opt-out that was negotiated to the treaty, we have only a short period to decide whether to exercise it. At the end of the discussions, we have the ability to continue to participate in the discussions; and at the end of all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
of the deliberations, we have the ability to decide whether to opt in. We are not necessarily able, within the time frame that is imposed on us, to enter into a full consultation or to take account of all the representations that people might want to make on the directives. We have only three months to decide whether to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister made any assessment, or is there any assessment ongoing, of the likely cost to the public purse of implementing any or all of the directives? This country might incur staff, judicial and administrative costs as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Discussions are in their early days. The shape of the directives could change, and the change might be substantive. At this stage, no regulatory impact assessment of the cost to business of the directive to enable the movement of third-country nationals within the European Union has been conducted. It was clear that the directive as worded would be against our policy and that we would not be in a position to opt in; we therefore did not consider that regulatory impact studies and such depth of consideration were needed. Obviously if, after negotiations, we reached a position at which we might be minded to opt in, we would have to consider properly costs to the Exchequer and business, and take those considerations on board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has answered my earlier question by indicating that the Government's position is rather stronger than that suggested by the wording of the motion. Does he think it possible that the directives might not be implemented simply because various countries, including Britain, raise so many objections that the European Commission has to go away and think again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is always a possibility, but there are gains to be made through the directives. Referring to the directive on long-term third-country nationals, if we believe that, all other things being equal, it is positive in terms of integration and social cohesion to treat third-country nationals in a way that is closely approximate to the treatment of EU nationals, much could be gained by laying out minimum standards for the treatment of such people. We should not necessarily walk away from the directives; they raise important issues, but there are considerable difficulties in several cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had the chance to talk to the Labour party delegation in the European Parliament? Is he aware that the European Parliament debated and produced a report on the future of long-term residents in the European Union? The Socialist group, which includes the Labour party, voted in favour of both the report and granting rights to long-term residents. If the Minister has not spoken to the Labour group, will he or one of his colleagues make that a priority, so that its views can be taken into account?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We regularly have discussions with our colleagues in the European Parliament, and we try to ensure that we understand their policies and co-operate with them as closely as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Document No. 11803/01 relates to the entry and residence of third-country nationals for paid and self-employed activities. Has the Minister taken on board the fact that if we opt into that directive, the effect on our pension rules and pension funds might be quite damaging? Do our national insurance contributions not cover all aspects of social security, which are very difficult to untangle? Does the Minister think that people who return to this country will bring benefits that are comparable to the benefits that might be taken out? Does he realise that the draft directive contains a pension problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I said that the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions have raised fundamental issues relating to part of that directive, which the hon. Gentleman addresses exactly. The way in which national insurance contributions can be broken down in certain circumstances is the difficulty that I have in mind when I say that the Treasury and the DWP would want that part of the directive to be either changed substantially, or removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Scrutiny Committee considered the three directives and produced a report on the Government's view as expressed to the Committee. One of the Committee's conclusions has led to our consideration of the directives today. Have the Government produced a written response to the Committee's questions, views, conclusions and recommendations? If not—I understand if the Government wanted this debate to take place first— will the Minister undertake to reply fully in writing within a reasonable time of his choosing, such as three months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: the Scrutiny Committee's main request was that we have this debate so as to understand better the Government's position. None the less, I do not see much that is unreasonable in the hon. Gentleman's request, so I shall seek to do as he asks within a reasonable period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government conclude that it is proper to opt into any or all of the directives, what opportunities will be there for parliamentary scrutiny, debate on the Floor of the House, and a vote on the directives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, these are early days, and many member states are raising many issues about the directives. However, there is a well-trodden route for parliamentary scrutiny, and the Committee in this place and the one in the other place exercise that provision fairly consistently and fairly rigidly. All documentation provided to which the Government respond will be presented for parliamentary scrutiny, and any alteration in policy will be scrutinised in the usual way. I cannot guarantee that there will be a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
debate in the House on any given issue that might arise between now and the end of the negotiations, but the hon. Gentleman will know that the Scrutiny Committees sometimes request a debate if they feel that one is warranted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have four more questions. First, am I right in thinking that it is perfectly compatible with the Schengen treaty and the United Kingdom opt-out from Schengen for us to sign the directives; and that third-country nationals moving between, say, the UK and the Netherlands, Belgium or France could be subject to immigration control even though they had established rights in the countries either side? Is it right that we can have the Schengen opt-out and border controls, but rights can still be given to people crossing from one country to the other?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but in the circumstances dictated by the directives as currently worded, we would in effect have given up a say in the collective decision on who came to the UK and in what circumstances. In those circumstances, we would have no rights to prevent people from coming here, because as currently written the directives give rights to, for example, long-term residents in second countries. If someone were resident in, say, Holland for five years, they would have an automatic right to enter the UK. We would have no ability to prevent them from doing so, and if they stayed in the UK for five years, they would have an automatic right to maintain their position within the UK.<br><br>
That goes against our current opt-out arrangements. We have insisted on having the ability outside the collective decisions of the EU to control not only our borders, but decisions on who does and does not reside in our country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will note that document No. 8237, which deals with the status of third-country nationals, refers to the rights of people who have resided in a country legally and continuously for five years. Our requirement for indefinite leave to remain is four years. Does he perceive a problem? If we opted in, would we be likely to change our conditions, or would the directive fall into line with us? Would there be a problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman points out some of the potential benefits of continuing to be part of discussions, even if we decide not to opt into a particular directive. Even if there are differences between the Schengen countries and those outwith Schengen, there may be substantial benefits for the EU and other countries if the EU presents to the outside world rules that are, as far as is reasonable and practical, similar. Even if the rules for different countries were not the same, people would not be totally confused, but would understand what applies in Denmark, France or Britain. There would be substantial benefits in presenting the same face to people in the rest of the world who try to become EU residents. That is part of our thinking on why we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
should continue to play a full part in discussing the directives, even if we have decided at this stage to exercise our right to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may remember that on Report of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, there was some discussion about the fact that various people who were given asylum—in the case raised, in the Netherlands—had come over to the UK. There was no easy way to ensure that people who were entitled to claim in more than one place did not abuse the system. Have the Government considered the potential advantages of a coherent system, such as that proposed in the directives, that would allow people to transfer their claims between EU countries? Say someone is given an entitlement to remain in the Netherlands for five years but discovers that a family member has settled in the UK; that individual might want to transfer their right to the UK—or vice versa.<br><br>
Such a system might solve some problems and reduce abuse. It might also ensure that people understand that there is a common system rather than different loopholes to be got through in different countries. The immigration service does not control everyone crossing every border every time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to forgive me, because I was not part of that debate on the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. The Government recognise that there are many advantages in maximising co-operation throughout the EU, especially on illegal immigration and asylum, and we are heavily engaged in various discussions to try to maximise the benefits of co-operation for all concerned. That does not necessarily cut across our ability or our desire to opt out of the directives.<br><br>
The Committee is discussing routes to legal immigration and employment in the EU, not how to deal with illegal immigration or asylum, although those are related matters that give rise to some complications. We want the maximum degree of co-operation to tackle illegal immigration effectively and deal with legitimate asylum applications to the EU. While doing that, we want to control who enters and has a right of residence in our own country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Page xviii of the European Scrutiny Committee's first report sets out a list of entitlements to equal treatment. For example, it refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"access to employment and self-employed activity; education and vocational training; the recognition of qualifications"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Has the Minister heard evidence of cases, or had constituency cases brought to his attention, of people who have indefinite leave to remain in this country but cannot take up jobs abroad within Europe because of their current status? Such problems have certainly affected my constituents. Can he explain the Government's understanding of how that problem has had an adverse impact on people who have a right to be here and a right to work? They should be able to work in jobs to which they are suited. Such people are often bilingual. They should be able to visit relatives
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
who live in another European country, but they are currently unable to have proper family links and ties because they cannot leave this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I am aware of such matters from both a constituency and a ministerial viewpoint. The hon. Gentleman is right. The downside of the opt-out of the Schengen area affects third-country nationals who gain permanent residence within one country. That can make it difficult for them to move, whether for employment or other reasons, within the European Union. Such a problem cannot be removed in its entirety, but it highlights the great benefits in our continuing to discuss facilitating easy transparent access to visas.<br><br>
The fact that the Schengen area operates within itself is of benefit to people, because when they gain access to a Schengen visa, they can move to Germany, France or anywhere else. It is in all our interests to have easily understood fences that have to be jumped in order for people to get to the other side of the Schengen area, although we could never completely remove the problem while we maintain our current policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clear up a doubt about the first directive on long-term resident status? If a third-country national acquires long-term resident status in a country and, after a period of years, seeks to transfer that residency status to another member state, would that person have to demonstrate to the second member state that he had stable and adequate financial resources and sickness insurance to cover all risks? If that person subsequently fell on hard times, would he have access to unemployment and sickness benefits that accrue to other people in that state?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, it is early days and such issues need to be sorted out. However, as the directive is currently worded, the decision taken by the first country would automatically confer rights on the individual that would go beyond the first country that had taken the decision to grant permanent stay. That is our fundamental problem with the directive. There would be limited ability for the second country to make decisions limiting rights of entry, because it would have signed up to the directive and effectively pooled the decision making. The decision about residency would have been taken by the first country of entry. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Problems could arise if the directive stays in its current form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am about to ask a silly question, I apologise. A couple of months ago, we legislated to change the status of British overseas territories such as St. Helena and Gibraltar. An issue was raised in the first report about the effect on people with British overseas passports rather than full UK passports. Am I right in thinking that, irrespective of our changes to legislation, the effect of the UK's opt-out to the directives would be that people with British passports that are not full passports would not be able to travel freely throughout the rest of the European Union?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0341">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Given what the Government said about their desire to give people who come from places such as St. Helena and Bermuda the fullest possible status in the UK, which was part of the motivation behind the legislation, are there any plans to give such people the right to travel throughout the EU fully, even if the Government's policy is that non-EU nationals should not? I hope that the Minister understands the question. Will we look favourably on people with British overseas passports—or whatever they are called these days? We are clearly obliged to give them more assistance in travelling and job hunting than non-EU nationals who do not have any sort of British passport?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subject to clarification if I am wrong, the answer is that the directives will not cut across or prevent individual member states from making bilateral agreements with third countries that are over and above the basic minimums in the directives. However, we have no ability to impose those decisions on the Schengen area from outside. If we have an arrangement with a British overseas territory, we cannot say that it will apply to the whole of the European Union. If the situation is not as I have said, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know. I am fairly sure that we are not precluded from entering into favourable arrangements with places such as St. Helena, and neither are France or Germany. However, we cannot say that because we have such arrangements with a third country, they should apply to the Schengen area.</span></p>
<p>5.12 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As there are no further questions, I think that we can move to the debate on the motion. In that regard, doubtless the Minister heard the point of order made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). The document to which the hon. Gentleman referred is not my responsibility but the Minister's, and he will respond to the point as he chooses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents No. 8237/01, draft Council Directive concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long term residents, and 11803/ 01, draft Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed activities; supports the Government's position on these measures; and takes note that the Government has not opted into them but intends to maintain a constructive approach and will consider whether to opt in once their final shape is clear.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the careful and courteous way in which he introduced the directives. He made it clear that the Government are not currently contemplating opting in. I support him wholeheartedly on that. Indeed, I go further and say that it would be difficult to envisage—although things might change—a situation in which we would opt in.<br><br>
The Minister said that our immigration policies should be transparent, rational and flexible—he is right. They should all be fair. I noticed a slight lack of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
reality when I read the directives over the weekend— it spoilt most of my Sunday—and this morning. I read passages that seemed to say plainly that there would be a time when control over our own borders will be not in our hands but in the hands of others. If that time is not now, it was suggested, it will come shortly.<br><br>
It is a fundamental principle that each member state of the EU should have control over its borders: directives should not be imposed on them from outside, particularly without their Parliaments having a full opportunity to scrutinise them. The Minister was right to agree with me that it is important for us to have control of our borders, but will that control exist in five or 10 years' time?<br><br>
With regard to the directive on the status of long-term residents, we are plainly being asked to sign up at some stage to a directive that will give rights to people from outside these shores, without full and explicit permission being granted by our own elected assembly in Parliament. When I asked the Minister how many third-country nationals would be eligible, I hoped that he would give an answer at some point—and I am sure that he will do so. I believe that there are millions of third-country nationals within the EU, and it would be nonsense if an institution outside our shores were to make a decision about where those people should be entitled to reside and work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman: I am sorry that I was unable to find the relevant figures in the sea of paper that we have on the three directives. The estimates for third-country nationals in the EU vary between 13 million and 20 million, so he is right that there are many such people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of the expansion of the EU is relevant to this point, and I hope that the Minister will address that today, or in a letter to me. In the next few years, many more countries will be added to the EU, so in a few years after that, many more millions of people will potentially qualify to benefit from this set of directives.<br><br>
The Minister has helpfully addressed several of my points, but I want to raise a few more. I do not expect them to be dealt with today, but I would be grateful if he would drop me a line to answer some of them.<br><br>
On the first of these directives, a fair amount of work will have to be done to define "stable and adequate resources", and
<br><blockquote><p>"sickness insurance covering all risks".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps, at some stage, the Minister could bring us up to date on that?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out that the document appears to apply to British overseas citizens who have no right of abode in the UK. That should be considered.<br><br>
When the Minister writes to me, I want him to deal with what would be the position if someone were to come here as a third-country national as a result of this directive, and they were then to find themselves out of work, for example. Can he confirm that, under this directive, it is envisaged that such a person would be as entitled as any UK citizen to the rights and benefits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
that exist in this country with regard to the national health service, education and housing? What would be the position of students?<br><br>
Can the Minister confirm that applications by third-country nationals to come here as long-term residents would have to be made to this country, so that decisions would be made by us, rather than by any EU body? I also hope that he will write to me in due course about any thoughts that he might have about Treasury and judicial implications.<br><br>
I also want the Minister to take a look at the phrase "family members" at some stage, as that is always difficult to define. I believe that it is defined somewhere in the paperwork, but I am unsure how far that goes, and the question of equal rights and long-term residence for family members is worth addressing.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister could tell us what caused the Government to reach their conclusions about the directives. What were the stumbling blocks and difficulties, and which issues, if cleared up, would make the Government much happier? Will he tell us a bit more about the discussions with other EU nations? Which countries does he think are more in favour of the adoption of the directives, and which more against? If there is a general opt-out by many countries, it will be difficult to think of the EU as having a coherent policy. If we do not opt in, will the other EU countries take our input as seriously as they might?<br><br>
The second directive, which deals with entry and residence of third-country nationals in paid and self-employed work, brings us back to the subject of pensions. That is a serious issue. It is well known that, historically, there has been a large pension fund in this country, but not in many other EU countries. There have been difficulties over the years about whether any of our pension money would be transferred from our control into that of others.<br><br>
Under the second directive, those who work here in the short term could take the benefits that have accrued to them, including national insurance benefits, out of the country. I have raised the issue with the Minister, and I know that he is alive to it, as it would be the first occasion that anyone could do that. Because of the difficulty of untangling NI contributions from the rest, there is a problem with not only the detail but the principle of the provisions on pensions.<br><br>
The third directive raises the question of freedom to travel. On the face of it, it seems not only harmless but proper and decent to give third-country nationals freedom to travel in member states for up to three months. One does not want to be alarmist—people might want to move around for holidays—but I am anxious to know how that might work in practice. Would such people have an automatic right to travel? Would our immigration authorities be permitted discretion in not allowing entry in certain circumstances? Would the right be unchallengeable? Would there be a method to ensure that people who travelled eventually ended up where they started?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
I put that badly, but the Minister will understand my concern, which is, I think, shared by the Government. If we were to opt in, we would, under the directives, be extending many rights to 13 million people—and in due course an awful lot more. The rights relate in part to residence, in part to working and in part to travelling in an EU state.<br><br>
With such large numbers, and as we have no idea who will choose to do what, it is quite important that the Government have their finger on the pulse if we ever consider opting in. They should be able to respond to any challenge to say that there might be a mass movement of people over which they have no control. That is a merely economic point, because the mass movement of people in extreme circumstances is potentially destabilising to both the country that they leave and the country to which they go.<br><br>
Those are various issues to which I hope the Minister will respond in due course. I return to the basic question: do the Government want to opt in to the directives? In what circumstances will they recommend that we do so? He began his comments by agreeing with me that our control over our borders is very important and we should not let go of it, so there is a fundamental clash of ideals with the current directives, which broadly suggest something of a surrender of certain rights that we have prized for a very long time. According to current EU developments, however, we may at some future stage be expected to surrender those rights.<br><br>
The Conservative party has noted and will note the directives, and we understand and support utterly the Government's current position, which is not to opt in to any of them. Does the Minister accept that we will want the most careful scrutiny of any proposals that arise as a result of further discussions? It is vital that any new proposals that the Government are happier to accept have the fullest possible scrutiny, not only in Committee but on the Floor of the House, so that the people of this country fully understand what they are being asked to assent to.</span></p>
<p>5.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Cran. I hope to do so again on other occasions.<br><br>
These measures are unusual because, for the first time that I can recall, the Scrutiny Committee agrees with the Government about them quite forcefully. It wants one or two reassurances, but essentially it agrees. The Opposition also seem to agree with the Government's position, so in broad terms, we all agree, which is a happy circumstance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But do you agree?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed: I strongly agree with the Government.<br><br>
One may then ask why we are discussing the matter, but clearly it is of great concern to the people whom we represent. There is no question but that there is a concern about people moving across frontiers, and it is increasing and causing political tensions in the EU and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
in this country. We must consider carefully anything that involves people moving across frontiers, whoever they may be.<br><br>
I suspect that the directives are driven by those who have a 19th-century belief in neo-liberalism. They have got out their classical economics textbooks and seen that one essential aspect of an economy is absolute mobility of the factors of production, without let or hindrance. One factor of production is labour, so people must be allowed to move freely all the time. Some of us are not classical economists and take a rather different view, but I suspect that there is some kind of Dr. Strangelove character in Brussels—or perhaps three or four of them on a committee—who decides on these measures and tries to slip them past countries that say, "Hang on, we're a bit nervous about this." The Minister has suggested that a number of countries have reservations about the directives, and understandably so.<br><br>
When I refer to the factors of production, I am talking about people. Capital can be transferred by pressing a button, but we cannot do that with people, who have cultural attachments to where they live. For various reasons, they do not necessarily want to move from one country to another, but they are often forced or induced to do so because they are poor and want to have a better life.<br><br>
I take an old-fashioned, democratic socialist view— which I hope does not offend too many people. I believe that we should sometimes adjust the economy to people, rather than the other way round. If there is poverty and inequality in the world, we should find ways of overcoming it, instead of saying to people—if hon. Members will pardon the phrase—"Get on your bike and go somewhere else."<br><br>
I start from perhaps a different standpoint from the theorists in the backrooms of Brussels. When I travelled to Brussels shortly after the Schengen agreement, I was kept in a long queue to have my passport checked. Everyone in the queue was saying that they thought that border controls in the European Union had been abolished, but we were scrutinised very carefully. It might have been only the British who were affected, but I wanted to tell the immigration officer that I strongly agree with border controls and was happy to have my passport checked. None the less, it was extraordinary that shortly after the Schengen agreement was made, we were subjected to strict border control in Brussels itself. It was something of a contradiction, as people behind me in the queue said, but I was not upset about going through border control.<br><br>
The worry about migration centres on unwarranted economic migration—people country-hopping within the EU. There are currently tensions between France and Britain for precisely that reason. Whatever technical details are contained in the directives, people will be concerned that they are another way in which people can country-hop within the EU. Whether we like it or not, that is of concern to electorates. It is suggested that social cohesion is one motivating force of the directive, but it has more to do with economics than with social theory. It is not about being kind to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
people who need work or want to move from one country to another, but making labour more mobile. I have concerns, and the Government are right to have concerns, about unwarranted economic migration. Those concerns are rising across Europe.<br><br>
Above all, we must defend the rights of people who are from countries where they face suffering or threats of death or persecution. We should welcome them to Britain as we have done throughout the centuries, and thereby enrich our society. However, if we do not have proper border controls but instead there is free movement of labour, as the extreme economic liberals would like, that will lead to a reaction that could damage our humane attitude to asylum seekers.<br><br>
For that reason above all, we must distinguish between the two categories. I do that when I speak to my constituents, who now label asylum seekers as economic migrants: they are not. For example, I know of people from Iran who have escaped from eight years in prison where many people have died alongside them. They have escaped through Turkey into Britain and do not want other Iranians to know because they might be persecuted even here. The rights of people who come from such countries must be defended. We must not let politics drift into a dangerous situation in which we resist all immigration, whether the people have been persecuted or not. We would lose our reputation for welcoming those who have been persecuted elsewhere.<br><br>
We want to be able to welcome people when we need their skills. We are doing that in Luton: many nurses are coming to Luton from the Philippines, which is good because we desperately need nurses. We want to have sensible immigration and humane rights for asylum seekers, but we need to maintain reasonable border controls. I would be concerned about any moves toward getting rid them.<br><br>
Perhaps not everyone in my party would agree with that. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggested that some Labour Members of the European Parliament have taken a different view. However, the Government have taken a sensible decision. I hope that they stick to that position, and that any directives that eventually agreed and implemented will be accepted not only by us, but by our electorates and by the general population.</span></p>
<p>5.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to invoke the strong opportunity for opposition on this issue, not least because to do so would require me to summon my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) to vote on my behalf, because, like the hon. Member for Woking, I am here to speak, not to vote, and I am mindful of that.<br><br>
It seems perfectly proper to have a "take note" debate, and we shall not dissent from the motion. Unlike the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), that does not mean that we take the same view as the Government or the Conservative party on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
the substance. I shall not detain the Committee long, but I want to pick up on a few points and make our view clear on an important issue.<br><br>
I share the Government's view that it is better to proceed slowly and get it right than to proceed quickly and get it wrong. I therefore have no fundamental objection to the view that, to give us time to get it right, we would rather stay out until we are satisfied that we can go in. It is more difficult the other way around.<br><br>
I have no great problem with a procedure whereby the directives on which we want to reserve our position not to join are presented. However, my party's view in both this place and the European Parliament is interestingly consistent, and seems to differ from that of the Labour party. I say "interestingly" because it seems that Labour's view in the European Parliament is different from Labour's view in this place. Our view is that the directives are worth while and that as soon as we can get the proposal right we should negotiate for a common status for third-country nationals throughout the EU that does not require us to give up the immigration controls and status that we have as a result of having opted out of Schengen.<br><br>
As I said, many issues were raised by the Scrutiny Committee deliberations and the considerations put to the Government. It would help if within a reasonable time frame a document might be produced that combined the Government's responses, not least because in some cases the Government will be able to find answers more easily than some of us.<br><br>
It would also help if the Minister said that at the same time as that response is published—three months seems a reasonable time scale—it will be possible to publish and, if that is the best approach, place in the Library responses to the directives that the Government have received, in particular the responses from the most important three groups: employers, trade unions and local authorities. Coupled with those are the responses from the Scottish Parliament and the Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, although they are not in exactly the same category.<br><br>
I mention employers and trade unions because I note that the Scrutiny Committee frequently refers to the views of employers and the work force. I understand that the European Economic and Social Council recommends that the UK sign up to the directives. Clearly, those involved in employment and the work force in Europe appreciate the advantage of economic mobility: it is a way not merely of allowing labour to move around more quickly, in old economic liberalism terms, but of meeting many of our market needs, whether for nurses from the Philippines, people to clean floors in public sector buildings, or doctors from Iran.<br><br>
My opening points are procedural and reinforce the request for the Government's responses, and the responses that they in turn have received, to be placed in the public domain. That would make us all better informed, and I hope that it is not controversial.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I share the view of the hon. Member for Woking— which is probably not subject to much dissent in the Committee—that we have not yet got right our procedure for scrutinising European legislation. We cannot do so on our own. It must be done in conjunction with other European institutions.<br><br>
Like me, the Minister has been involved in debates in which we have been caught by procedural problems. There are real concerns that there should be an opportunity for member states and their Parliaments to consider proposals and feed back their comments not only at an early stage, but when proposals are in their final form. A weakness of the system is that a draft directive is put on the table and there is then a consultative process. Governments may opt in or opt out. They may or may not have time to consult, but as I understand it, Parliament is not guaranteed a right to have a say, let alone a vote, when the directive has reached its final stage.<br><br>
I have always been concerned about the need to modernise the European Union in a way that democratises it. Members of the European Parliament of all party backgrounds are frustrated that the opportunity to do more than take part in consultation at an early stage is often stymied by the fact that the system does not allow the directives to come back to the Parliament.<br><br>
In this case, I am aware of the parties' views because the report to the European Parliament happened to have as its rapporteur Baroness Ludford, a Liberal Democrat London MEP who is also a Member of the House of Lords. I have kept in touch with her about what is happening, and she has reported to me the views that have been expressed. It is fair to say that the Conservative MEPs, in their group, voted against the directives, whereas the socialist, radical and liberal democratic groups voted in favour of the report. I am not arguing that colleagues of the same party must express the same view whether they sit in Brussels, the Parliament in Strasbourg, or Westminster. It is perfectly proper for them to have different views—that is not a criticism—but the Government must fully take into account any differences.<br><br>
I share the view that we must improve our procedures. This is a very important issue. The directive must get careful scrutiny in both Houses if it is to be amended in such a way that the Government is likely to recommend that we change domestic law. We must be sure that the directive does what we intend it to do, that it does not have unforeseen consequences and that questions can be asked by hon. Members of all shades of the political spectrum about its implications.<br><br>
It is very important that we distinguish between these issues and those to do with the entitlements that we give to those who get asylum in this country. I picked up that the Minister was careful to ensure that we have two different sets of considerations. The debate is easily and regularly confused. I hold to the view that we have an international obligation to deal with people who want to put their case for asylum and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
who should be given asylum. I believe that that is best done on an EU-wide basis and that there should be one process.<br><br>
The Seville summit report, which picks up from Tampere, showed that we would move towards common procedures. I would go to the end of the process and say that we should have a European asylum agency that makes decisions on behalf of member states, so that the same decisions are made for Greece as for Ireland—a system that ensures that responsibilities are shared and that all countries take a proportionate number, depending on their size, so that the accidents of geography do not result in one country taking on a bigger burden than the others. Historically, most people come across the land mass through the countries on the other side of Europe.<br><br>
By contrast, it is right—I share a view that is common among all three main parties—that the United Kingdom Parliament, prompted by the UK Government, should decide our immigration policy. We should reserve the right to have a different immigration policy from Ireland, Denmark or elsewhere.<br><br>
That leads me to express my long-held view that it is right to maintain a position that keeps us out of Schengen. In spite of the view of some of my European Parliament colleagues that we should be part of the Schengen agreement, I believe that it would not be right, timely, or politically sellable. The advantage of our island status—this could also apply to Ireland—is that it gives us an ability to control immigration that should not be thrown away lightly. It is important that we understand the positions of other countries and I am happy with the idea of a common asylum processing policy, but we should have separate immigration policies.<br><br>
In that context, I should like the Minister to answer one specific question about something that is implicit in the documents. As the hon. Member for Woking said, we give a considerable number of people either definite extended leave to remain, or indefinite leave to remain. The report refers many times to people who in our terms would be classed as those with indefinite leave to remain. Have the Government decided what will happen from now on to people who in the past have not been granted the asylum that they sought, but were granted definite or indefinite leave to remain?<br><br>
In the constituency of the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) are people who have come from places such as Sri Lanka: although they have not passed the specific asylum test, they have been allowed to stay for compassionate reasons. All our constituencies contain such people, who have come from all over the world. Do the Government intend to continue with the policy that means that stage one of an asylum claim is to pass the asylum test, but that a compassionate view is always taken on leave to remain—whether definite or indefinite—even if an individual does not pass the test?<br><br>
Identity cards or entitlement cards have been topical this week because of the Home Office's expected announcement before the summer of its consultation paper. A common system for third-country nationals
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
creates huge advantages, one of which is to ensure that there is greater certainty as people move around the continent. A problem that I witnessed at Sangatte was that people had no papers at all, and therefore no status, before they were dealt with in the first round. Another problem was that so many forms of status existed.<br><br>
The circumstances of two long-standing constituents of mine illustrate that problem. The husband comes from the Ivory Coast and is a pastor of a church; his wife comes from Togo and worked in her country's embassy until there was a change of Government. They are completely upright and law-abiding, they have children who were born in this country and they all have a perfect right to be here. However, they are inhibited from travelling, even to Paris to do things that the Minister would regard as perfectly legitimate for his own constituents—to see relatives, to go to meetings of Ivorians in Europe, to attend national festivals, and so on.<br><br>
Real benefits are to be had from a common status that allows for something that is not a passport and does not say that an individual has full rights to be in this country, but that shows that the holder has a right to travel elsewhere. Such an identity card could apply to students and other categories of person referred to in the documents. Many people come to Europe on a scholarship to do a degree course; degree courses here increasingly include a year abroad, to mutual advantage. A student based at the London School of Economics or Birmingham university might pursue a course that includes a year out in France, Spain or elsewhere. The simpler we can make the system, and the less uncertain for people coming to Europe perfectly legitimately to train, or to become an apprentice or student, the better it will be.<br><br>
There would be benefits in having a system that clarified the status of those whose status is dependent on other family members and for whom there is a non-employment consequence. The hon. Member for Woking raised that point. I refer to such people as the elderly relative who comes to settle here on the back of the fact that all her family are working here. Like other hon. Members, I am often frustrated when someone in that position who has come here as a dependent—normally an elderly relative of someone already here— wants to travel. Let us say that another family member, such as a child, has died in Germany. All sorts of complications surround that individual's ability to go to the funeral at short notice, or to visit the grave. Such real-life situations currently require applications to the Home Office, letters to Ministers, and dealings with immigration officers, officials and other administration.<br><br>
There are strong arguments for a system that allows people to move around in Europe once they have been given a particular status. I accept that there are social security complications and problems with the recognition of parallel qualifications—all the things touched on in the report—so I am not at all critical, but the matter needs to be looked into carefully and not ill-advisedly. I hope that at the end of that process the Government will not drag their heels but will take the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
view of the Economic and Social Council, accept that the case for this has been made, and then ensure that we proceed in a way that makes for maximum degree of cross-party support in Parliament.<br><br>
When we make progress, we can do so in the context of the point that the hon. Member for Luton made— with the confidence of our constituents. They need to know that when we proceed, we know what we are doing and have judged that our action is to the advantage of everyone, not just of the few. Our action should not undermine people's confidence in the immigration processes. It should bring the huge benefit that many more people would be in this country and other European countries legitimately and could come out of what is traditionally called the black economy—the lack of status and the hiding that they go into when they have status in one country but not another, and feel compelled to move. We would then have a Europe in which there are different tiers of entitlement, but almost everyone's entitlement, once valid in one part of Europe, is valid throughout the EU.<br><br>
That is my general perspective, but I do not underestimate the difficulties. I am grateful for the considered way in which the Minister has presented the matter and I look forward to the Government's considered response, when they have had a chance to listen to the voices here and respond to the reports and comments made today.</span></p>
<p>5.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A lot of questions have been asked and a lot of specific points raised. Some of them are totally relevant to the directives and some go far wider, touching on such matters as entitlement cards and asylum policy. If the Committee will forgive me, I am not sure that it would be helpful if I tried to answer every single specific point now. I shall try to pick up the questions that have been asked and ensure that Members have a response to them, while dealing with the matters that need to be dealt with and with the broad situation. We are in early days with regard to the directives.<br><br>
I turn first to the procedure issue picked up by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. We supplied the Committee with all the relevant papers last week, but we all know that busy Members run into this place having read papers at the weekend, then go to the Vote Office and pick up another set. I was having considerable problems when Members were referring not to the papers but to the first or the second directive. I believe that there is a typographical error in the papers distributed by the Vote Office. I apologise for that, but it was outside the Home Office's control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate for me to say to the Committee that it has been reported to me that there was a problem with the documents at the Vote Office. Through the Clerk, I have asked for that matter to be investigated, in the light of which I shall write to you, Mr. Hughes.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So, apologies from everybody for that. I hope that it did not stand in the way of the debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Woking talked about the surrender of national control and my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North urged us never to allow those barriers to come down. I hope that both will forgive me if I am wrong, but I picked up a very UK-centred reading of the directives from their comments. We will make a big mistake if we begin to read the directives from that point of view. We have a clear opt-out that has been accepted by and negotiated with our partners.<br><br>
Many countries in the European Union have accepted and implemented the Schengen acquis, which means that they approach the issues from a completely different perspective. As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey pointed out, such countries often have a different geographical perspective. We should not get hung up when we see intentions and desires laid out in a directive, on which we have an opt-out, that addresses not only the UK but the whole of the European Union. If free movement and the total removal of border controls exists in mainland Europe, there are no sinister motives behind saying that benefits that apply to third-country nationals, or long-term third-country residents, should be levelled out and maintained to a fairly high degree across the European Union. That is in the interests of third-country nationals and not those of either capitalism or a huge European machine that seeks to crush our national identity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean to talk only about Britain, because in other countries, such as Denmark, there is increasing concern about the movements of people across frontiers. We are in a period of change and other countries have their concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but although other countries have a number of reservations they have not totally rejected the directives. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made an important point about separating the issues from concerns about illegal immigration and claims for asylum. We have long accepted that long-term residents of our country should enjoy a status equivalent or thereabouts to that of nationals born here, which is something that also applies in other European Union countries. I hope that that will continue to apply and that there will not be a great desire to say that a long-term resident of this country should not be treated as being close to a national.<br><br>
Even if we decide to opt out at the end of the day because we cannot get changes on our key concerns, there is a lot to be gained by continuing to be part of the debate because there are many rights that should apply to both our third-country nationals and third-country nationals in Germany, France and other parts of the European Union.<br><br>
We are at early days with regard to the directive, and the Scrutiny Committee asked us to conduct this debate to expose the main issues. We have no problem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
with the levelling up of the arrangements on issues such as employment rights for third-country nationals. We have the fundamental difficulty that, as worded, the directives break our opt-out facility, whereby we can control our borders and the residents in our country. Unless we can make changes that effectively honour that, we will not be able to sign up to the directives.<br><br>
We have not been able to assess costs because of the arrangements of the opt-out. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about having the consultation in the public domain as soon as possible. We have no desire to hide it, but there is no need to rush to it either, as we have no ability to opt in halfway through the process. Now that we have decided to exercise our opt-out, we cannot opt in to any directive halfway through the discussions. We can take a decision only at the end of the process, when a finalised document comes out of the negotiations. Then we can see whether it is acceptable to us, and opt in.<br><br>
At that time, regulatory impact studies and the views of businesses, local government and other organisations will be important, and Parliament will want to know them. We should not seek to hide them, and I assure hon. Members that we will not. However, we will not be able to take any fundamental decisions on policy until we come to the end of the process, which is still a long time away. People do not need to worry that there will be some policy change, and that they will not be informed about the background views of different people before it has been considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from anything that the Minister has said, and I share his view that Britain, Denmark and Ireland are all outside Schengen, so far as I know. Certainly Britain and Ireland are, and clearly have a different starting position. That is why I asked whether they had taken the same initial view.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm whether, if we keep our opt-out at the end of the process, there is a chance of reviewing that at an agreed number of years later? That could be on our own as the United Kingdom, or with any other countries that opted out. Is it something that could always be kept under review so that, as long as a country was out, it could always go in? Once it is in, it is much more difficult to get out again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would have to seek agreement to be allowed in at some point if we did not exercise the opt-in. We would be able to approach people and ask for that to be considered.<br><br>
All the countries have entered general scrutiny reservations on long-term residents. All member states have entered reservations on the text, but not all of them have specifically stated that they oppose the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
directive. Generally on freedom of travel, a new measure needs to be drafted to meet the requirements and desires of member states, and a consensus will be difficult to achieve.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is right to say that Denmark and Ireland have opt-outs on Schengen. Ireland has opted in to the employment directive, but has entered a general scrutiny reservation on its detail. Ireland has not opted in on freedom of movement, and Denmark does not take part in discussions on any title IV measures but can use its national law to transpose them into law within Denmark if it agrees.<br><br>
I shall tackle the other main points that need to be made clear. The hon. Member for Woking mentioned a major problem on national insurance contributions. It is not a major problem with regard to our European Union partners, but it is in relation to third-country nationals. We have a pay-as-you-go scheme rather than an applied scheme, and there have been long arguments with many other countries about whether part of those payments can be effectively taken away as pension entitlements. That is not possible, because of the type of scheme that we would need to be able to do that. Part of the directives conflicts with that position. The matter is extremely difficult to resolve, and has been flagged up clearly by the British Government as a possible difficulty in any opting-in.<br><br>
I should clarify one other main point, by confirming what I told the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey: British overseas nationals are treated as third-country nationals, not UK nationals. Therefore, unless we minimise any potential difficulties as far as we can, while maintaining our position, British overseas nationals travelling to the Schengen countries will experience the same problems as third-country nationals living in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I shall write to hon. Members on the specific issues that they raised, and try to take up as many as I can. I shall try to put as much information as I can in the public domain, so that people can see the current position and the potential difficulties with making progress on the directives.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents No. 8237/01, draft Council Directive concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long term residents, and 11803/01, draft Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed activities; supports the Government's position on these measures; and takes note that the Government has not opted into them but intends to maintain a constructive approach and will consider whether to opt in once their final shape is clear.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at five minutes past Six o'clock.</i></p>
