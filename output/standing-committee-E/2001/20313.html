<p><i>European Union document No. 12934/01, draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport.</i></p>
<p><i>European Union document No. 15111/01, draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation No. 2236/95/EC laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European networks.]</i></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Transport (Mr. John Spellar)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in today's debate. Initially, the sole focus was to have been the Commission's European transport policy White Paper. The Scrutiny Committee recommended, however, that we also consider recent Commission proposals to amend three pieces of European Union legislation: the 1996 transport trans-European network guidelines, the 1995 trans-European network financing regulation and the 1985 European drivers' hours regulation.<br><br>
Considering the provisions together makes good sense. A key element of the White Paper is the elimination of bottlenecks on the main international routes in Europe. The Commission believes that its proposals to revise the trans-European network guidelines and financing regulation are an important part of the solution to such problems. The White Paper also stresses the need to improve quality in the road sector, and the Commission feels that the changes proposed to the drivers' hours rules are an important part of that process.<br><br>
It would be helpful if I set the scene by saying a few words about the four documents and our approach to them. I realise that that will take a little longer than the normal introduction to such debates, but I crave the Committee's indulgence.<br><br>
The White Paper identifies the main problems that we must tackle, including increasing congestion on main road and rail routes, in towns and at airports; the harmful effects of transport on the environment and public health; and the heavy toll of road accidents. I am sure that we all agree with that focus. Indeed, the Government's 10-year plan promised to cut congestion and pollution and significantly cut road casualties. We welcome the Commission's fresh look at those challenges—even as we study the implications for the United Kingdom with a cautious eye, as we must.<br><br>
The White Paper sets the key target of ensuring that the share of the market held by each mode is returned to the 1998 level by 2010, which is undoubtedly challenging. For example, without major new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
measures, heavy goods vehicle traffic in the EU is forecast to increase by nearly 50 per cent. over its 1998 level by 2010. We doubt, however, that so much attention should be focused on delivering the White Paper's arbitrary target. We feel that modal shift should be but one component of an overall strategy to achieve sustainable transport. It is a means to an end, and it can be a means of achieving other objectives and of indicating how well they are being met. Modal shift on its own cannot, however, tackle the problems that Europe faces.<br><br>
The Commission proposes a package of 60 Community measures, some of which have already been submitted to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and are being considered by them. Others are still being worked out in detail, and we shall respond to them and give our views to the Scrutiny Committee once they have been introduced as formal proposals. In the limited time available I cannot, of course, tell hon. Members what the Government think about all the proposals in the White Paper. Indeed, we have still to decide our position on some of them in the light of comments from the 100 or so respondents to our consultation exercise. I want, however, to touch on a few key issues.<br><br>
We firmly support some of the Commission's proposals, such as the further opening up of international and national railfreight and of rail passenger services to competitive tendering. We also support the proposal to introduce a "single sky" in the management of European airspace by 2004.<br><br>
We are, however, concerned about other proposals. For example, we shall need to examine any Commission proposals on infrastructure charging very carefully. As regards roads, we agree that the current legislative framework is perverse and must be reformed. Member states cannot, for instance, implement the "polluter pays" principle by making lorries pay the full social and environmental costs that they impose. We do not, however, believe that the legislation should contain prescriptive rules that require member states to charge in a certain way; nor should it require member states to charge at all if they do not wish to. Furthermore, member states must be free to allocate the revenue raised to their national priorities, and not be required to spend it on specific transport or environment-related projects. We are unclear what the Commission wants to achieve by proposing a common infrastructure charging methodology across all transport modes. We await formal proposals with significant interest.<br><br>
In considering the proposals in the White Paper, we need to ensure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are upheld, and that competence is not extended unnecessarily to the Commission. We see no need to harmonise tax rates across the EU for specific users such as the haulage industry. Effective minimum rates are the best tool to support environmental objectives. As always, we will insist on unanimity for any tax harmonisation measures.<br><br>
We also have doubts about some of the road safety harmonisation proposals, such as motorway signing, where we already have a good safety record—as does Sweden, the best in Europe. We would want to be sure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
that harmonisation produced benefits. Employment measures might go too far in the desire for harmonisation—as did the recent over-prescriptive proposals for legislation on training courses for professional drivers. The costs and benefits of further rail technical harmonisation measures need to be carefully examined.<br><br>
I shall now move on to the two trans-European network proposals from the Commission that were trailed in the White Paper. On the guideline revisions, we support the Commission's assessment that measures are needed to address bottlenecks on the TEN; to promote short sea shipping; to promote integration between rail and air; and to facilitate links between the TEN and the transport network in the countries seeking accession to the EU.<br><br>
However, we have serious difficulties with the Commission's proposal to add six new priority projects to the 14 agreed at Essen in 1994. First, there is no proper evidence that those projects are indeed Europe's top priorities. Secondly, it seems inappropriate to add new projects when 11 of the existing 14 priorities have still to be completed. We believe that consideration of new priority projects should be postponed until the major review that the Commission is planning in 2004. I am reassured that most respondents to our consultation exercise agree.<br><br>
We also have problems with the proposal to increase the maximum TEN grant to 20 per cent. of project costs. Current EU funding for the TEN is not sufficient to provide support of even 10 per cent. for major projects. If a 20 per cent. grant were agreed, the Commission would almost certainly demand a significant increase in the TEN budget. Additionally, it is difficult to see how the UK would gain access to 20 per cent. grants because of the limited criteria proposed for such awards.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to touch on the proposal to amend the rules on drivers' hours. We welcome the fact that no major changes are proposed to the driving limits and rest requirements, because they are the basis on which the infrastructure of the haulage industry has been established. We support the updating of exemptions, the removal of ambiguities and internal inconsistencies and the abandonment of the complex compensation arrangements, which are impossible to enforce. However, we are not content with everything in the proposal and we shall be seeking some changes. Our negotiating position will be informed by responses to the consultation exercise, the closing date for which was yesterday.<br><br>
I hope that I have provided enough information to stimulate discussion. I shall now endeavour to answer questions that hon. Members may have on the four documents that are under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and that they should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for every hon. Member to ask a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his clear explanation; I agree with much of what he said. On drivers' hours, the statement
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
about sticking to the bottom line of 10 hours was the most robust of public statements. Does that remain the Government's position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does. Two issues are involved. One is the drivers' hours regulations; the other is the working time directive. The hon. Gentleman will know from discussions with the Road Haulage Association that we have conducted some robust negotiations in Europe alongside its industry lobby. In terms of maintaining the 10 hours as opposed to the eight hours, and in terms of definitions of working time, especially non-working time, we have successfully obtained a regime that will be consistent with the great majority of road haulage operations in this country.<br><br>
Industry and politics in this country have combined to achieve a satisfactory outcome. However, we are still mindful that we must keep a firm eye on the details and work with industry on unforeseen difficulties in the proposed regimes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of Back-Bench members of the Committee, may I say what a pleasure it is to see you in what might be a new role, Mr. Hurst?<br><br>
From the deliberations of the Transport Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions, the Minister will note that there is much concern that the White Paper from Europe does not dovetail with the Government's 10-year plan, and might conflict with it in terms of spending priorities during those 10 years. Will he take time to explain how he feels about that suggestion, and to outline how the Government are trying to make the EU modify aspects of the European White Paper so that it is in line with our national priorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Friday, I addressed the annual dinner in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). I am not sure what I said that has led him not to be present today, but I understood that he was due to chair our Committee. The meal was fine Yorkshire fare.<br><br>
May I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) that we are concerned, as I have suggested, by the possible tendency of the White Paper to be over-prescriptive and consider arbitrary targets? We believe that there should be broad objectives, but that individual countries need to consider how they can best achieve the outcomes in their own circumstances.<br><br>
There is considerable scope for co-operation and, given the increase in trade between countries, a need to consider where harmonisation of regulations can be desirable and mutually agreed. We believe that the objectives in the 10-year plan are correct for British circumstances, so we will again engage in vigorous discussion with our European colleagues. There is a Transport Council meeting towards the end of the month. Yesterday I met the Dutch Transport Minister, whose country has a realistic and robust view of transport issues and priorities, and of the proper engagement and balance between the Commission and nation states.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Hoban <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fareham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his comments about infrastructure charging? Will he confirm that it will be a tax, and so will not be subject to qualified majority voting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has slightly mixed up one or two issues. We believe that the legislation should not contain prescriptive rules that require member states to charge in a certain way, or that it should require member states to charge if they do not want to. Therefore, we would not be in favour of a universal imposition of infrastructure charging.<br><br>
Along with several other countries, especially Holland, Germany and Austria, we are considering infrastructure charging for heavy goods vehicles. There would be an argument for trying to ensure that, on a technical basis, such schemes were interoperable. The hon. Gentleman will know that the idea of charging for the use of the infrastructure by vehicles appeals to the road haulage industry, as long as it is revenue-neutral, because it would ensure that British hauliers were on a level playing field with continental operators, who enjoy certain other benefits. British hauliers are charged when they use a number of roads, particularly the autoroutes in France, whereas foreign hauliers are not charged in the UK. There is a consensus that infrastructure charging, either by time or by distance—there is probably a balance of preference for distance—would be a way of achieving a balance. However, it would have to be revenue-neutral for British hauliers, which would be of advantage to them in relation to foreign competitors.<br><br>
Given the large number of vehicles that move across national frontiers, a system that allowed for interoperability of technical equipment—not of charges—would be desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say how pleased I am to see that your eminence as a Chairman has been recognised, Mr. Hurst? I am watching your career with great interest and am sure that today is the start of a great surge forward.<br><br>
May I ask what is not an unserious or trivial question? In the interests of public and driver safety, has any consideration been given to changing the side of the road on which people drive across the pan-European juggernaut network that is developing? I ask seriously. There is confusion in people's minds when they change to a different side of the road; it puts fear into them. Have we considered the safety implications of the development of the network?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always thought that it is a good idea to switch to driving on the right when one goes to Europe. However, as I do not wish to stimulate any scare story in the media, I shall state firmly that we have given no consideration to switching from driving on the left to driving on the right in the United Kingdom, nor do I envisage our doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise for my late arrival, Mr. Hurst? I was stuck in the foreign travel office of St. Thomas's hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He was trying to get back to Norfolk.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I should explain that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) lives opposite me in Norwich, so he knows where I am from. May I ask the Minister about low emission fuels, which are dealt with on page 79 of the White Paper? It mentions, in particular, natural gas, biodiesel and zero-sulphur diesel, refers to an objective to replace 20 per cent. of conventional fuels with substitutes by 2020, and proposes certain measures at a Community level. There is reference to a potential directive on a compulsory biofuel element to the overall mix of 2 per cent. initially, increasing to 6 per cent. by 2010, and mention of tax reductions to promote the market for biofuels. I have a special interest in the matter because Norfolk is primarily an arable county. The measures could provide a new market for agriculture, as well as being highly attractive environmentally, in terms of producing low emission fuels. My first question to the Minister is, does he agree that that should be done on a Community basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Questions should only be asked one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that measures should be introduced on a Community basis or is this an issue in relation to which subsidiarity should apply—it should happen in this country and in other member states? If so, what are the Government going to do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would really have to refer that question to the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), who takes what is called in the House a "keen interest"—actually a rabid interest—in alternative fuels. He has been very active on that question.<br><br>
I am cautious because I do not think that we should focus completely on one form of alternative fuel, as there is a widespread engineering, commercial and environmental debate over what is the most appropriate fuel. For example, the use of hydrogen in fuel cells is an issue, as is the use of methanol as a fuel source. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the use of biofuels is another issue. We should encourage the use of several sources: another possibility is the combination of internal combustion engine and electric charging, which can give well over 100 miles per gallon. There is scope for considering several alternatives. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the 1000th pump for liquefied natural gas was recently opened at a petrol station.<br><br>
There is a considerable range of climate benefits, but we also need to consider what may happen in an accident, as some of the fuels must be held under pressure. We need, too, to consider what might be the most efficient distribution system and most sustainable long-term action. Some fuels might have a wider application, whereas biofuel may have only a limited one in terms of the number of vehicles that it services.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wants to pursue the matter, I suggest that he contacts the Under-Secretary, who will be able to give him a full response.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. For the assistance of hon. Members, they may ask only one question at a time, although they may ask as many questions as they are called upon to ask during the hour's session.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hurst. May I add my congratulations to those of my hon. Friends on your appointment and say how great it is to see such a friendly, fair and generous face in the Chair?<br><br>
It is obvious from the transport network outline plan that the only major part of the network in the south of England consists of the two roads passing through Kent. Nothing is planned between Dover and Southampton. If that is to be the case, and no major improvement is anticipated in that area, might heavy goods vehicles be withdrawn from those areas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend draws attention to the distinction between matters that the European Commission rightly perceives as its province and those that are the province of the nation state. The issue is not whether some routes are more or less important nationally, but what the routes contribute to the trans-European network. That gives us some difficulty with proposed funding for some routes, as the priority routes are, understandably, those that deal with significant bottlenecks in Europe, especially those across the Alps and the Pyrenees. Therefore, we need to know how much funding will come to the United Kingdom. I understand that the route between Denmark and Germany seems to have been added during discussions, but I shall attend a Transport Council meeting in a couple of weeks before I report back on that matter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend addresses a proper question, but it is more for consideration by the United Kingdom as a subsidiary matter than by the Commission under the trans-European network.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to a point about aviation on page 16 of the fifth report of 2001–02 of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions? It says that the Commission is
<br><blockquote><p>"failing to reflect the commercial, environmental and economic needs of Member States."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister think that that is a little harsh or that it is a fair reflection of the White Paper?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; could the hon. Gentleman identify the paragraph?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course. It is paragraph (e) on page 16, relating to aviation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Select Committee is drawing attention to the issue of airport capacity—an area that we will tackle in the various regional airport studies to be published in the next few months and, subsequently, following consultation on the White Paper, towards the end of the year. We will certainly address that because it is the major constraint facing us. The Select Committee rightly addresses the fact that much work is being done, especially under the single European sky initiative, to manage airspace more effectively. However, that should not be seen as a significant constraint because runway capacity is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
difficulty, especially in major hub airports. Other European countries are also facing that problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Janet Dean <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister for clarification of the United Kingdom outline network plan for the railways. The plan shows some but not all existing conventional lines on British rail. In particular, it does not show two in the Cumbria area—the coastal route, and the Crewe to Derby line that passes through my constituency, which could form a major cross-country route for freight and passenger services, linking west and east and increasing the capacity of rail in this country. I should be grateful for the Minister's view on the matter and for some reassurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, with regard to our domestic lines, we are undertaking a rigorous examination to see where existing routes or routes that have been extinguished can be brought into operation to provide flexibility and additional capacity in the system. As my hon. Friend will know, in the West Midlands the Strategic Rail Authority recently announced the reopening of the Stourbridge to Walsall line for freight.<br><br>
I am also aware that there are proposals from several district councils to reopen the Ivanhoe line to provide passenger linkage and take into account two phenomena taking place in that area: the considerable number of new estates that are being built and the increasing need to commute following the decline of some local industries. The work pattern is increasingly one of commuting to hubs of work, and the opportunity to do so greatly enhances communities. MPs and councils in the area have already raised the matter with me, and I know that my hon. Friend takes a keen interest.<br><br>
We are alert to that issue. Although we do not regard it as part of the core European network, it is an important part of our commitment to provide alternative forms of public transport and to achieve our objective of a 50 per cent. increase in passenger traffic and an 80 per cent. increase in freight traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hurst? It is a pleasure to be in a Committee chaired by a fellow Essex Member of Parliament.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban) made a point about infrastructure charges. If there is going to be some long-term harmonisation of infrastructure charging throughout the EU, will the Minister say whether the revenue from those charges will go to member states or to the Commission?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will make the position clear so that there is no room for doubt. Harmonisation is about the desirability of the interoperability of technical systems. In other words, there would be a need for only one transponder and one technical system, not four or five different transponders. In the same way, there is a desire to have interoperable systems for toll tunnels so that there can be one account.<br><br>
There is an understandable and proper desire to assess the extent to which we can have technical compatibility, so that a heavy goods vehicle, which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
so often part of international trade, can operate in several countries using one technical system. That is different from the question of the level of taxation, and it is not an unknown phenomenon. After all, most of us have credit cards that operate under international systems in many countries, but have bank accounts in national banks that work under national regimes and are separate companies. There are advantages to having degrees of technical compatibility.<br><br>
The same is true of industry standards throughout the entertainment industry with regard to DVDs, videotapes and audio tapes. It is possible to have individual national regimes. Part of the question is whether one charges according to time on the road or distance travelled. Different countries may have different answers, depending on their geography. Holland has roughly the same density of population as England, and has many similar transport problems, although it is fairly flat. Other countries have different problems to tackle. Some countries have many vehicles that just transit, and that will increasingly be the case as more countries to the east accede to the EU. I must make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that we are not talking about the harmonisation of the charge, but about the charge being revenue-neutral to provide a level playing field for the British haulage industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also congratulate you on your elevation, Mr. Hurst, and look forward to your chairmanship.<br><br>
My constituency is split by the M60, which runs through the middle of it, and is midway between the ports of Liverpool and Hull and the M6 and M1 motorways. Distribution parks are either side of the motorway. As heavy goods vehicles cause many problems, what plans do the Government have to emulate some of the railfreight terminals throughout Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are considering expanding railfreight and developing railfreight terminals. That is one reason why we were especially concerned about the events at Fréthun in France and the suspension of services. Last night, SNCF and various parts of the French Government held emergency talks, and I understand that the French Government announced that they would send more police to the site. That is enormously welcome, as there was a serious danger of operators, understandably, shifting back to operating by road freight. Several operators have already done so. That was a matter of concern mainly to the railfreight companies and their employees, and for Government policy. We have been actively engaged with our French counterparts to try to bring about an improvement.<br><br>
It is not just our intention, but our objective to increase the amount of freight going by rail. As my hon. Friend rightly said, that requires the construction of appropriate freight terminals, and we are engaged in discussions on the subject. Off the top of my head, I cannot remember where discussions have reached regarding his constituency, but if he contacts me later, we can examine the position. We are engaged in such discussions in other areas of the country as well.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper deals with road safety from page 64 onwards and talks about issues such as differences in signage, speed limits and legal blood alcohol levels throughout the European Union. Does the Minister regard those matters as appropriate for European-level action or does he consider that they should be tackled on the basis of subsidiarity, at member state level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We believe that those issues are most appropriately dealt with by member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister outline the Government's position on a European pedestrian safety directive? The European Union has competence in that matter, so are the Government pressing for a change in the European White Paper so that it takes account of pedestrians? Walking is not only an important mode of transport but a fundamental part of getting about from vehicle to vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is more than that. The United Kingdom, with Sweden, has the safest roads in Europe. That is a record of which we should be proud, and several measures that we have taken provide good examples for the rest of Europe, particularly the way in which there has been a systematic approach taken by Governments of both parties during the years. However, we must admit that we are not as good on pedestrian safety, particularly child safety, so Department officials are working with officials in other European countries to try to establish the key differences and discover whether they include road design and vehicle speed or, more generally, lifestyle, urban design and patterns of play. We must get to the underlying data to enable us to have a clearer view of the problems of, especially, child pedestrian safety but also broader pedestrian safety.<br><br>
The interaction between vehicles and pedestrians is of considerable concern. The agreement between the European motor industry and the Commission will enable much faster changes in design and earlier incorporation of pedestrian-friendly features to vehicles. That should effect a reduction in pedestrian accidents and is the right way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It occurs to me that the Minister could use his experience at the Ministry of Defence to give some views on the relationship between military and commercial airlines, and therefore the Commission's proposals. A degree of controversy seems to surround the issue, particularly in relation to northern France, so what does the Minister think about priority for military aircraft? Northern France is part of a busy and congested part of European skyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not favour the incorporation of military into civilian airspace. There should be considerable co-operation between air traffic control in both spheres, as there is in this country, but we do not believe that one should be incorporated into the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press my right hon. Friend about map 3.15, showing United Kingdom rail services. I thank him for his comments on the Ivanhoe line, which is important to north-west
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Leicestershire and south Derbyshire and to Burton in east Staffordshire as a good project for the future.<br><br>
The map does not show a complete set of the country's existing routes. Lines that are not shown on the map include the Settle to Carlisle line and the York to Scarborough line in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby. However, some quite minor lines in the north of Scotland are shown. I seek reassurance that just because some lines are not shown in the outline plan for 2010 it does not mean that they will not exist then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend and to the Committee for coughing; as they can see, I have a bad cold.<br><br>
I assure hon. Members that the routes shown on the trans-European network maps have a trans-European rather than a domestic value. Routes that carry freight or passenger traffic may have a significant local or regional value but that does not necessarily mean that they are a key part of the trans-European network. It is not to their detriment that they are not on the maps.<br><br>
The Commission intends to look again at the maps in 2004, which will probably be the best time to consider whether the UK maps need to be changed. However, I stress again the differentiation—the reason why some routes appear on the maps and others do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The national air traffic control centre in Swanwick is in my constituency. What are the barriers to the creation of a single European sky by 2004?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The national air traffic control centre in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is working extremely well, in spite of newspaper scare stories before it was operational. It is a tribute to the management and especially to the work of the air traffic controllers.<br><br>
There will have to be intense discussions between the countries of Europe on the matter. The need to organise airspace in a more rational way is recognised, but there are difficulties, as the hon. Gentleman is aware, especially now that the national air traffic control centre is in his constituency. I believe that he is engaged in discussions with a considerable number of centres. The increased volume of air traffic means that there must be greater rationalisation in the management of European airspace, in which Swanwick is well placed to play a major role. However, I do not anticipate that achieving that objective will be plain sailing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The travelling public want to use different modes of transport. The White Paper refers to integrated ticketing systems to allow people to go by coach, sea or air, which some European countries are seriously considering. Are the Government doing so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly are; there are several local initiatives on the issue, including Transport for London. We want to ensure that such systems would be interoperable. Several countries, including, I believe, Hong Kong, have such a system, with smart cards containing stored value, which can then respond to the particular journey at the appropriate price. They provide an effective mechanism for allocating the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
income between various providers. The Dutch transport system uses strip cards as an effective means of moving people around, but it is less effective at allocating the income and ensuring that the people using the transport are paying for it.<br><br>
Activity is taking place on the international front and we can learn from the experience of those who have already started to develop such systems. Overall, we can see the considerable attractions—particularly in urban areas with substantial commuter traffic—of using those systems to gain a better handle on income and speed up the flow of passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What discussions have taken place with the new entrant countries? When enlargement of the European Union goes ahead, transport systems across the continent will be fundamental to welding the new Europe together. What role have new entrants played in producing the proposals before us today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A considerable role, I believe. It is partly to do with their own domestic transport infrastructures which, as a result of their previously inadequate economies, are in a fairly dire state. Additional pressures will also be placed on the transport infrastructure of countries bordering the new entrants. Austria and, to some extent, Germany are concerned about the additional burdens on their transport systems and want to ensure that adequate rail links for freight are in place in preference to placing extra burdens on road systems. In the border between northern and southern Europe—in the Alps and to the immediate east—significant pressures are exerted on the roads and the local environment, as the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel showed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to discuss train safety, particularly the proposed introduction of the advanced train protection system. The European requirement is for installation across the trans-European network, while the Cullen requirement is for installation on a much broader range of track—all high-speed routes, as I understand it. Has an estimate been made of the difference in costs between installation on the trans-European network and the much broader Cullen requirement for installation on all high-speed tracks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that we have yet put a figure on it. I recognise the importance of the hon. Gentleman's question. If I recall correctly, it is addressed in the Select Committee's report and we shall deal with it in our response. We welcome moves towards greater safety and towards interoperability on systems across Europe—part of creating a single European market. We also have to examine cost-benefit considerations and time scales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend about rail links in the south-east? According to the map, a route is to be developed along the south coast—seemingly in line with the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch model railway. Is that a mapping error, or will there be a link between the south coast and the Ashford terminal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch railway, along with the Hythe royal military canal and the Martello towers, was a key part of our defence installations.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
The map relates to the trans-European networks. In the UK, we are looking in particular at the lines that run to Ireland and that link up with another European country. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean), whether a line is on the map relates not to whether it is important to a particular area, but to whether it is seen as part of the trans-European network. We shall consider that again in 2004 and we shall have to take into account a number of local sensitivities to try to ensure the presence of some lines on the map. Of course, by that time, they may have acquired greater significance than they had when the original map was drawn up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 14 on page 9 of the Select Committee report relates to train protection systems. The Committee estimates that £1.5 billion would be required to install the second and third levels of the European rail traffic management system. It talks about achieving full interoperability for £3 billion, which it says is prohibitive. Surely the point is that the position here is different from those of continental railways in that high-speed and freight services often share the same lines. Is that why we are talking about so great a sum of money in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not estimated the costs of interoperability on the trans-European rail network. We will obviously consider the technical specifications that are drawn up. At the same time, we must ensure that we conduct a proper cost-benefit analysis and that the cost of the system is not above what would enable it to be sustainable. We must have discussions about how to achieve the required level of safety, but at the same time we must ensure that that is sustainable with regard to running an effective rail system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some time ago, I asked a Transport Minister in the Chamber a question about investment in railfreight as compared to that in road haulage and when that would be equalised, and I was immediately called in by the north-western branch of the Road Haulage Association. I understand that, in some European countries, the road haulage and rail people work together to their mutual benefit. Do the Government encourage such teamwork between those two groups?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. In discussions, I have found road hauliers to be open to an increase in the use of rail for carrying freight. After all, for many hauliers whose loads have to go by road because of where they come from or go to or the nature of the route, nothing is more frustrating than being held up in traffic jams that are caused partly by loads that need not be on the road and would be carried more appropriately by rail. There is a far more sophisticated approach to the proper use of rail for carrying freight than may be imagined by those who are not engaged in those discussions. The latter sometimes regard these interests as antagonistic, whereas in fact those who are involved with the industry recognise their complementarity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Francois</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Returning for a moment to the point about train protection systems, paragraph 13 on page 8 of the report points out that the UK's automatic train protection system is not compatible with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
European train control system that the Commission talks about under its directives. We therefore face the prospect of going through the exercise twice, first with our automatic train protection system and then with another system as required by the Commission. The recommendations state that all 100 mph lines should have the European system by 2008 and that all trains running at above that speed should be similarly protected by 2010. What is the Government's position on the incompatibility between those two systems, which threaten to burden us with a tremendous cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The paragraph to which the hon. Gentleman refers says that the Uff-Cullen inquiry—not the Commission—recommends that the European train control system should be fitted to all 100 mph lines in the UK by 2008. In that context it is important to note that the directives do not require works to be undertaken to comply with the standards. The obligations arise only when projects involving new work or renovations are undertaken. The wording does not say that those protections must be put into existing systems by a particular date. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, it is a case of deciding on the appropriate safety requirement and looking at the benefits compared with the costs and comparing that with other parts of the rail system to ensure safety. The more prescriptive requirement comes from Cullen, rather than from the Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the map on page 57 of the Commission's White Paper, entitled "Potential `specific' projects". When my hon. Friend the Member for Burton asked whether a review of some of the schemes was envisaged, my right hon. Friend replied that there would be one in 2004. On careful study of the map, the only project that would seem to have any impact on the UK is the Galileo satellite project, which appears on the map as a little satellite hovering over the Arctic circle. What is the UK position on the Galileo satellite project and does my right hon. Friend envisage other UK projects appearing on the map sometime after the review period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Taking the second point first, as I said earlier, one of the difficulties with the trans-European network projects is that, understandably, they are focused on areas that deal with through traffic between member states. Geographically that does not apply nearly as much to us as it does to the routes through Austria and those up to the Alps and across the Pyrenees.<br><br>
Along with a number of other countries we have been posing questions about Galileo. We have already made some progress such as on the involvement of private companies in the commissioning agencies and therefore on the question of conflicts of interest between those who are involved in the project specification and direction as opposed to those who will contract to provide the service. There is also a question whether that should be for civilian purposes only, which is a concern of NATO. NATO works on global positioning system interoperability, and it is enormously important that that remains the military
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
standard in terms of both military effectiveness and the sheer cost of replacing equipment.<br><br>
The final question concerns the project's cost and where that will be borne. As my hon. Friend knows, the project is part of the trans-European network funding. The question is whether there will be transparency, visibility and limits on levels of expenditure. Will there be a clear view of the benefits and the charges that may be made for them? In other words, how will an income stream be generated for the operation of the system? Some of those questions have already been resolved satisfactorily and others were briefly discussed in the margins of the Finance Ministers' meeting. No doubt we shall return to those questions at the Transport Ministers' Council later this month. We have made considerable progress, and we may be able to go ahead at the next meeting, but we need to get some final details sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions. Before I call the Minister to move his motion, I inform the Committee that I have selected the amendment tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh), but I call on the Minister to move the substantive motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union documents No. 11932/01, Commission White Paper: European Transport Policy for 2010: Time to Decide, and No. 12597/01, draft decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending decision No. 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network; and endorses the Government's approach to discussions on these documents.—[<i>Mr. Spellar.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, in line 5, leave out from "network;" to end and add
<br><blockquote><p>`endorses the criticisms made of the White Paper by the Transport, Local Government and the Regions Committee in its Fifth Report (HC, 2001–02, 556) on the White Paper; notes the Committee's conclusions that, if the proposals in the White Paper were to be implemented, they would incur additional expenditure for little, if any, benefit and would have very serious consequences for transport policy in the United Kingdom; and accordingly calls on Ministers to incorporate the recommendations and conclusions of the Report in discussions on the White Paper in the Council of Ministers'.</p></blockquote>
There have been questions about the whereabouts of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York, the hon. Member for Normanton and other members of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions. The answer is that they are engaged on parliamentary business outside this country. It is a matter of some regret that we are debating something this important but have been denied the presence of members of that Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah, I beg your pardon. It is nice to see a member of that Select Committee. We are all the better for the hon. Gentleman's presence and it is wonderful to have him here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to misinform the Committee. The hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
Member for Vale of York is in Committee two Doors down the Corridor from this Room. She is not out of the country and he may want to correct that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I blush with embarrassment and withdraw my remarks. I feel a great void opening before me as I disappear through a trap door.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is blushing in embarrassment. Shoot the wounded!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my case, it is question of bayoneting the wounded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Pugh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much too embarrassed now; do not rub it in.<br><br>
It is a great pleasure to have you in the Chair, Mr. Hurst. A new Chairman is like visiting someone's constituency; one wants to heap on the praise to the point that the recipient almost feels physically sick. I am pleased to say that the Committee has not let us down this afternoon.<br><br>
The Minister was wise to make it clear that we will continue to drive on the left side of the road. I was inexperienced in my Bradford days and a radio station persuaded me to announce on 1 April that, as our salute to the European Union, we would all drive on the right within the boundaries of Bradford. The phone banks were almost ripped off at city hall and I had to go in at lunch time to say that that would apply only to heavy goods vehicles.<br><br>
I want to refer to something that is not in the White Paper—the fact that it is not included is almost glaring. There are many references to different modes of transportation such as trains, buses and trolley buses. If this were "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" and the question was "What mode of travel do people in Europe use more than trolley buses?", the answer would be motor bikes, yet there is not a single mention of motor bikes in the White Paper. That is extraordinary, particularly if one considers the enormous importance of motor cycles in southern parts of Europe.<br><br>
I have had the benefit of a brief from my colleagues in the European Parliament and I will read from it shortly. The White Paper contains about 60 proposals. Strangely, most of them are centred on rail, although the Commission seeks to promote sustainability and intermodality. Conservatives believe that the policy approach is not sufficiently balanced, because it focuses on a single mode of travel. The paper seeks to extend rail's market share of passenger traffic from 6 per cent. to 15 per cent. and goods from 8 per cent. to 15 per cent.<br><br>
The paper cites the haulage structure of the United States as a comparable model for the EU, which strikes me as a little whacky, to say the least. It suggests that in the United States total haulage accounts for 40 per cent. of movements. The brief says that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Conservatives have reservations about the validity of this comparison."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
That is a polite way of putting it. The Minister must be thinking about EU expansion, because I cannot imagine any way to achieve 40 per cent. without going beyond the Ural mountains and into the tundra. Some of the aspirations are wholly unrealistic and I agree with many of the concerns and recommendations of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions.<br><br>
The Minister referred to Fréthun. The situation is appalling. The haulage companies using that depot can go through the channel tunnel only by using Eurotunnel's shuttle facilities. I am a bit reluctant to say this, because the Minister is obviously suffering physically from a cold and I do not want to cause his blood pressure to rise, but the Government have been useless in the matter. They have been warned repeatedly that the situation is getting worse, but have done practically nothing. As recently as last week, I asked on the Floor of the House during oral questions about Fréthun and, with due respect to the junior Minister, was brushed off with a particularly silly answer that referred wholly to people travelling on Eurostar.<br><br>
I am angry about the situation because it allows a coach and horses to be driven through the European White Paper—[<i>Interruption.</i>] No pun was intended. It will take an enormous amount of time to recover confidence in the service. We know the damage that Scotland has suffered because of the problem: a freight terminal has closed and is unlikely to reopen and business has completely lost confidence in cross-channel freight. English, Welsh and Scottish Railways has lost £6 million in the past few weeks and Scottish whisky will no longer cross the channel through the tunnel.<br><br>
When I was a member of the then Transport Select Committee, we discussed using the tunnel for freight services. We heard from several experts from, I believe, English, Welsh and Scottish Railways, who said that it was not worth while taking freight through the tunnel until one could undertake a journey that passed on through the Alps or the Pyrenees. Since that time—about four or five years ago—matters have improved and there have been changes in the charging regime. The reason for the mess is that the potential for future growth has gone. People would be very brave to take that route. As a result, there will be an increase in road transport going through Kent and more large lorries travelling through northern France and Belgium.<br><br>
We are caught in the middle of a great power struggle between SNCF and the French Government. Anyone could see that that fence was useless; it was only 9 m high and not very strong. It was torn down the week before last and demolished during the weekend. The warnings were there. What is the point of spending time producing documents such as the White Paper if we cannot get something as simple as that right? It is good that French railways are in discussions with the French Government and that they feel a degree of embarrassment. If a higher fence and an increased police presence had been in place before Christmas, we would not have such problems now. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
look forward to the Minister's response. Without being nasty or personal, this country has not done enough to press the French Government. That is to the detriment of this sort of White Paper initiative: it has become meaningless.<br><br>
The second point that I want to raise concerns freight, and I particularly take on board the interesting exchanges on the train protection system. That is one of the most difficult matters that the Government have to determine. We frequently talk about safety, but such systems offer us an opportunity of additional capacity on the railways. I recognise how expensive they are, but if we are to increase capacity they are necessary. As far as I understand it, we will need to move block signalling so that trains can travel safely when closer together. That seems a sensible idea, but there is a substantial difference between moving freight on the continent and doing so in Britain. In this country freight shares rails, but there is a degree of separation in northern France.<br><br>
If the United Kingdom is going to move towards the figures laid out in the White Paper, I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on an important step. He will recall that last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) asked a question about freight. He pointed out that about 43 per cent. of all freight movements take place on the west coast. Given that fact, the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority must make a decision on the mixture of freight and passenger trains. Before October, a deal was on the table that referred to a minimum of 42 freight trains a day. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether we are talking about 42 a day, or a greater or lesser figure.<br><br>
The Commission desires liberalisation of the rail regime and speaks of a need to speed up liberalisation:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council asks the Commission to put forward its proposals as soon as possible … to achieve a fully operational internal market."</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, there are enormous implications, especially for the competition rules.<br><br>
The Minister will have seen much press speculation at the weekend that Britain could resort to requesting Brussels to bend the EU rules on state aid to companies so that it could secure future bank loans for Railtrack. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm or deny that the Government are looking for a guarantee of loans of £5.5 billion for Railtrack, subject to the procedures set out in the White Paper.<br><br>
on the problems with road haulage, I hope that what I say will not damage the Minister's career—perhaps we can strike this from the record, as I see that the Whip is not happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ivor Caplin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hove)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just listening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know.<br><br>
I was very heartened at what the Minister said about the relationship between the working time directive and the regulations before us. It is important that we stick to the 10-hour rule for night working. That is particularly important to the distribution industry, given the physical location of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
hubs in this country. If we moved to eight or nine hours, we would be looking at considerable costs for the industry—in some cases estimated at <i>£5</i> billion a year, including productivity problems. The side effects might include an increase in traffic at peak times and a reduction in drivers' pay. We look forward to the Minister being robust on that and on the training directive, when it comes.<br><br>
We have concerns about aviation. We support what the Minister said about the mix of military and commercial, but are concerned about a single European sky and Eurocontrol. That is not a gut worry about Johnny Foreigner controlling our airspace; it is concern for national interests, especially about the EU discouraging mergers of non-EU airlines. My understanding is that the Government remain fully committed to open competition and open skies. We are very concerned to find ourselves trying to bolster up a pan-European airline industry that, compared with the British airline industry, is very ineffective. We do not believe that that is a problem with air traffic control, but there are the practical dangers of UK air traffic control becoming burdened with inappropriate regulations to protect vested interests in less efficient systems in other member states.<br><br>
We are also concerned that there is no political evidence that if we give up control of our airspace we shall have more influence than at present. Clearly, we are in a key position regarding Atlantic routes. We are worried that we might end up in a less strong negotiating position because of Eurocontrol.<br><br>
It has become impossible for us to continue to argue that the UK should control air service agreements with third countries and landing slots in UK airports. We saw an interesting development in late January when the bilaterals essentially collapsed over the British Airways-American Airlines deal. We are worried that part of the aim is to repeat open competition for a system of regulated airline alliances that could turn into cartels.<br><br>
We recognise that airlines are going through a particularly difficult patch, but as the Minister said, in a few short weeks we shall begin to examine regional airports, some of which are near to where you, Mr. Hurst, and I live—we will have a particular interest. We must also recognise that things are changing across Europe and that by the end of the decade Charles de Gaulle is likely to be the number one hub in Europe. We will be fighting for second or third place.<br><br>
There is no doubt about the economic impact and importance of airlines in generating jobs. Interesting economic arguments can be made about interlining at hubs. I am firmly of the view that a hub would ensure that additional calls would be made in other countries. Theoretically, it could make the difference between three flights a day and six flights a day to Tokyo. We must ensure that we have importance as a hub, because that will be immensely important to the British economy.</span></p>
<p>11.51 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Pugh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
and, contrary to the comments of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), I am not out of the country. In the main, the Select Committee has examined how Japan has managed its ports and how it has tried to get more people to travel by tube.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Vale of York told me that she intended to speak today, but unhappily she has been unable to do so. I am therefore here to represent what I think is the unanimous opinion of the Select Committee. I apologise in advance to those Select Committee members who are here: if the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) were present, she would have made these remarks herself and I am sorry that I cannot rival her customary charm and bonhomie.<br><br>
To emphasise some concerns of the Select Committee, which I hope that the Minister will take on board, I shall briefly rehearse the thrust of the amendments. One worry, which has already been voiced, is that the White Paper does not fit full square with the 10-year plan. Serious consideration should be given to how it could fit. A disappointment for the Committee is that although a great deal of thought has been given in the White Paper to reducing traffic demand, long distance transport and the unnecessary journeys that people make have not been sufficiently examined. The paper assumes that everything will carry on much as before, although it may be mitigated to an extent. Members of the Select Committee thought that unambitious. Other areas, such as social exclusion and the people who do not have access to a fast Mercedes to go down the autobahn, appear to have been relatively untouched.<br><br>
Interoperability also concerns the Select Committee. In general, all of us favour interoperability and we do not want to stand in second place when safety is at issue, but the Committee felt that an element of common sense should be applied, because costs can be significant—a minimum job could be £1.5 billion, £3 billion or other astronomic figures. We do not know what the costs will be. The Committee's plea is to take on board common-sense considerations, as well as the principle of subsidiarity and the need for dovetailing with the 10-year transport plan.<br><br>
The White Paper refers to the European railway agency. There is concern that there may be conflict and duplication and a suspicion that the agency may develop into something more than an advisory body. That must be clarified. The Select Committee favoured best practice as a mechanism for progress instead of another tier of bureaucracy.<br><br>
A fundamental consideration for the Select Committee was harmonisation of diesel tax. That is fundamental because it would lead to lower duty in this country and an increase in road freight. Given the general bias and the feeling that there must be a shift to rail freight, that is a serious consideration.<br><br>
Equally serious is road safety, to which insufficient attention is paid—each year in Europe, around 40,000 people are killed and there are 1.7 million casualties, which represents an enormous amount of public and private suffering. The White Paper includes schemes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
and ambitions, but none represents a practical or feasible means of reducing those figures. The best proposal is for harmonisation of road signs on major intercontinental routes, but that is not the same as spreading best practice throughout Europe.<br><br>
On a more minor issue, the White Paper praised the possible benefit of using inland waterways, but that was not coupled with plans to support the structure of inland waterways. They are a forgotten boon in this country because they are underused, but significant investment would be required to make them better used.<br><br>
There are many suggestions in the White Paper, but most are not costed and it disregards existing funding plans in individual countries. It is heavy on aspiration, but would generate problems because its impact would be inconsistent and distort the 10-year transport plan that we all support in this country. The White Paper is short on ambition and lacks coherence with some national plans. If the Minister were mindful of those problems and pursued them at a higher level, the Select Committee would be pleased to hear his response.</span></p>
<p>11.58 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Francois</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee if I have to leave a little early. I have a long-standing commitment to meet members of the British Ports Association. It is a transport-related organisation, so I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I am not present for the whole of his reply.<br><br>
I am tempted to follow up the point about Galileo. I have visions of a Galileo satellite in synchronous orbit above the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch railway, but I shall focus on two specific matters and try to be brief.<br><br>
First, I want to follow up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar about freight. I accept that SNCF is having some difficulty, but I suspect that English, Welsh and Scottish Railway is suffering much more pain. It is a major issue and we need serious action.<br><br>
It seems to be generally agreed that the diversion of freight traffic from road to rail should be encouraged and there has been much discussion about that. If that is so, clearly we cannot allow the situation to continue much longer because we cannot possibly encourage people to change from one mode of freight transport to another if they are faced with such problems. That will only encourage people to move freight by road and air rather than rail.<br><br>
I share the view that the United Kingdom Government have not done enough to press the French Government to take decisive action on the problem. I echo the call for the UK Government to take the issue more seriously and increase their efforts to persuade our French partners to do something decisive and do it quickly. The longer the problem continues, the more it will dent future efforts to persuade people to move freight traffic on to the railways. That is a serious issue.<br><br>
I serve on the Environmental Audit Committee and we spend much time considering sustainable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
development. Therefore, I was particularly taken by paragraph 10 of the Select Committee report:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are dismayed that the Commission does not aim to reduce the need for people and goods to travel long distances, merely to reduce the dependence on more environmentally damaging forms of transport. Decisive action is required now to reduce demand. The Commission has failed to formulate an implementable sustainable transport policy, which should include the integration of transport and land-use planning to reduce the need to travel."</p></blockquote>
Wearing my sustainable development hat, as it were, I believe that issue to be important. Our amendment calls for Ministers to incorporate the recommendations and conclusions of the report in discussions on the White Paper in the Council of Ministers. I urge the Minister, even if he is not minded to accept our amendment in its entirety, to take that point on board, and to use his good offices to ensure that the issue is raised when discussions take place in the Council.</span></p>
<p>12.01 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am having lunch with a major coach operator in my constituency later, so this morning seems to be part of a transport day. I am concerned that the White Paper grants the European Union a great say over transport policy in all member states. My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) referred to page 7 of the Select Committee report, which stated
<br><blockquote><p>"We are dismayed that the Commission does not aim to reduce the need for people and goods to travel long distances,"</p></blockquote>
Inevitably, the European Union would not want that change to take place. It could not justify the existence of trans-European rail or road networks if people were encouraged to remain in their own country.<br><br>
I am also concerned about what we have allowed to happen in Europe. Hon. Members have frequently referred to the maps with which we have been supplied. I refer to map 3.15, which shows the rail network for the United Kingdom. The pink lines represent proposed high-speed routes in accordance with a European Union directive. The map also implies that there is no direct rail link between London and Reading and no west coast main line. The map shows that routes will come into existence as a result of EU action, which is another example of the EU trying to justify its transport policy. In the words of the Select Committee report,
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission has created proposals that achieve the convoluted result of being both too general and too detailed, while failing to reflect the commercial, environmental and economic needs of Member States."</p></blockquote>
In aggregate, we have a process that does not meet member states' needs. It tries to justify the existence of EU transport policy and does it rather badly. The White Paper is littered with examples of matters on which the EU thinks that it should take action—for instance, trying to tell people how to deal with traffic congestion in their area. With subsidiarity, member states should be able to deal with such matters rather than Members of the European Parliament or the Commission having to decide how to solve traffic problems in the constituency of Fareham. The EU is even trying to identify the cost of individual loads of transport.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
My first question today was whether the infrastructure charges would be subject to qualified majority voting. I accept the Minister's clarification that a distinction has to be made between charging and recording how many vehicles travel across the EU. My worry is that although the Government may rebut the charge and say that we have been misled, the EU still raises issues about charging, saying that we should identify the cost of different methods of travelling and ensure that users are aware of those costs.<br><br>
In time, the EU will be pushing for a common charging structure. Given that transport decisions can be made under QMV, we must ensure that the charges are identified as taxes and that they are subject to unanimity. The Government, like all political parties in this country, believe that tax should not be a subject for QMV.<br><br>
The EU has talked about tighter regulatory controls, about enforcing them across the pan-European networks and about telling member states how often they should check vehicles. Again, it is for member states to decide such matters in line with their own transport and health and safety regulations; it should not be dealt with by diktats imposed from Brussels. There is a host of such matters.<br><br>
I note with interest that the EU has a clear view about the separation of wheel and rail. The White Paper has adopted the model that the Conservative Government put into effect with the privatisation of the rail industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That puts the hon. Gentleman on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am clear about it; it is for the Government to decide how to restructure the rail industry to recover from the botched nationalisation of Railtrack brought about by Stephen Byers last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should refer to the hon. Member by the name of his constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hurst, for failing to remember that the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is the right hon. Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was still botched.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoban</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, the nationalisation was still botched. It is for the Government to decide how to get themselves out of the hole that they have dug for themselves; they should not follow diktats from the EU.<br><br>
The problem with the White Paper is that it seeks to extend the competence of the EU beyond what is reasonable. The EU is trying to become involved in issues that should be the preserve of member states. I noted earlier the robust comments of the Minister on matters such as working time and I hope that his robust defence of such issues will continue in Brussels. He must ensure that the EU stays out of those matters that are the preserve of national Governments. I therefore support the amendment to the motion before the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p>12.8pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last remark of the hon. Member for Fareham was slightly ungenerous. He should speak not only to the coach operators at lunch time but to the road haulage operators, who will tell him that we conducted a most vigorous case on behalf of the British road haulage industry—and the haulage industry across Europe.<br><br>
I lament the absence of the hon. Member for Vale of York, in whose name the amendment stands. She is lost somewhere between Tokyo and Committee Room 11. Despite her absence and the splendid defence put up by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, we cannot accept the amendment to the Government's motion tabled by the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh). We will take into account the conclusions and recommendations of the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and Regions when we develop the Government's approach to the White Paper in the discussions of the Transport Council.<br><br>
We reject the amendment for two main reasons. First, the Committee's report was published only on Friday and we have not had sufficient time to consider in detail the implications of all its conclusions and recommendations. Also, at first glance, we do not agree with some of the conclusions, such as the Committee's statement that,
<br><blockquote><p>"By refusing to bring forward the European Pedestrian Safety Directive, the Commission has shown a callous disregard for the lives of European citizens."</p></blockquote>
By coming to an agreement with the European vehicle manufacturers, we believe that we will benefit the cause of road safety and the reduction of loss of life among pedestrians. Although there was plenty of interesting comment in the report, we cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Southport is no longer present. From some of his comments about the White Paper and realism—he talked of practicality compared with aspiration—he seemed extremely unsuited to be a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament. We look forward to his political journey. He also mentioned waterways, in which I take an interest as the MP for a constituency with more canals than there are in Venice, as I am proudly and relentlessly told.<br><br>
Several Opposition Members commented on the issue of freight coming through the channel tunnel and were uncharacteristically uncharitable about the considerable efforts made by the Government, right up to the Prime Minister, to try to get movement from the French Government. Something slightly unfair was also said about the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport, who rightly pointed out that the French Government had changed legislation on passengers to permit a tightening-up at Gare du Nord.<br><br>
I fully accept that we are not satisfied with the situation at Fréthun, or the response. However, we are much more satisfied with the response at the Eurostar terminal, even to the extent, as the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Brentwood and Ongar will be aware, that the previous Chief of the General Staff from this country advised Eurostar on the structure of and some operations involved in the protection of that site. There has been considerable British engagement, but the system still has a fundamental weakness. To some extent, the successes elsewhere have put further pressure on the freight yard.<br><br>
We have had only a preliminary suggestion of the outcome of last night's meeting in Paris and will need to see what its real effect is. We will continue to press on that. We take on board that there is little point in making statements about a shift in freight from road to rail if we do not have the mechanism to make such a shift, and if there is a shift in the reverse direction. We are united on that. I fully understand the desire and need of the Opposition to make partisan points on the subject, but there have been considerable efforts and will continue to be so.<br><br>
I was slightly uncertain about the hon. Gentleman's comments on mergers of airlines and the attitude of the European Commission. The Commission has been robust in its response to several member states that have been seeking to maintain national flag carriers by state subsidy rather than allowing them to merge with other airlines. The Commission is to be congratulated on its pragmatic approach. It has also put considerable pressure on the French Government over the situation at the freight terminal.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the west coast main line, the number of freight paths and state aid. Those issues are the source of considerable discussion, not only with freight companies but with Virgin and the other train operators on that line. A constructive approach is being taken by all those involved in recognising that no one will get all that they are looking for but that there will be a considerable improvement. Those companies are working together to ensure maximum capacity on that line.<br><br>
On state aid, the Commission has been helpful with the early stages of financing Railtrack in administration and I have no reason to believe that it will be any less positive in recognising the appalling situation that we inherited from a botched
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
privatisation—I think that the hon. Member for Fareham made a slight slip of the tongue when he described the root cause of the difficulties. We will work towards bringing Rail track out of administration and dealing with the mess that we inherited from the Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being very open with the Committee, for which we are grateful. Do I take it from what he said that the answer to my question—whether we are approaching the Commission for a relaxation of the rules on state aid—is yes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are always in discussion with the Commission about several issues on which state aid provisions may or may not apply. That is true across the board precisely because the Commission is concerned wherever there is subsidy or an artificial market because of its desire to create a single European market.<br><br>
In conclusion, we have had a useful discussion and dealt with many issues. I therefore commend the motion to the Committee and urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
