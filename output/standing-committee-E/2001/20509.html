	<p>[MR. BILL O'BRIEN 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Execution of Orders Freezing Assets or Evidence</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is debating the draft European Union framework decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence. The Justice and Home Affairs Council in February gave its approval to the general approach of the instrument, but a number of Member States, including of course the United Kingdom, have continuing parliamentary scrutiny reserves. The text has also been resubmitted to the European Parliament, and its comments are awaited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft instrument is the first practical proposal for the application of the principle of mutual recognition, which was described by Heads of State and Government at the special European Council at Tampere in Finland, as the cornerstone of future judicial co-operation in the European Union. As its title suggests, it addresses the important issue of how evidence needed in criminal proceedings—in terrorism-related cases, for instance—and assets likely to be subject to a confiscation order, can be best secured against disappearance or destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those involved in organised crime are adept at concealing their traces, and national boundaries mean nothing to them. Speed and ease of action by law enforcement is therefore of the essence, but that is not an objective to be achieved if that involves unacceptable encroachment on personal rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have argued—successfully, in the main—for a range of amendments to protect such rights. As the Committee is aware, the draft instrument has already been the subject of extensive correspondence between myself and the European Scrutiny Committee, and a number of issues have also been raised by the relevant Scrutiny Committee in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that there is nothing in this draft instrument which compels any member state to transmit property or evidence to another state. In other words, with one exception, to which I will return, the framework decision is concerned entirely with provisional measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now take the Committee briefly through the draft instrument. Article 1 lays down the purpose of the instrument, which is to provide the framework of rules under which member states shall enforce freezing orders made in other states. It also contains a specific provision to the effect that the instrument does not affect the obligations for member states to respect their obligations as enshrined in article 6 of the EU treaty. Article 6 requires member states when acting in the European Union to respect the rights guaranteed by the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Article 2 provides some important definitions. I know that the Committee is concerned about the definition of the "issuing state" and its ability to define the "judicial authorities" that issue freezing orders. I am sure that we will come back to that question in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 describes the offences in respect of which the mutual recognition arrangements will be available. It falls into two groups. First there is a list of specific offences—terrorism, drug trafficking and so on— which must be punishable in the issuing state by a maximum prison term of at least three years. In respect of those, the executing state cannot apply a dual criminality requirement as a condition of executing the order. For offences other than those in the list the executing state can apply a dual criminality requirement and can also make it a condition that the offence is one for which a freezing order would be available on its territory in a purely domestic case. Article 4 provides that orders, along with a special certificate, shall be transmitted on a judicial authority to judicial authority basis. However there are special provisions relation to the UK and Ireland which will permit us to continue to require incoming requests to be routed via a central authority. There are good practical reasons why those should continue to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 is the central provision in many respects. It imposes an obligation on member states to recognise and enforce a freezing order made in another state
	<br><blockquote><p>"without any further formality being required".</p></blockquote>
It also requires that the executing state shall, when enforcing the order, comply with any special requirements specified by the issuing state to ensure the admissibility of the evidence. However, no such obligation arises if to do so would be contrary to the fundamental principles of law of the executing state. The article also requires the executing state to decide on the execution of the order and inform the issuing state as soon as possible, and whenever practicable within 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 contains an important provision whereby the executing state can lay down a maximum period for which the assets in question can remain frozen. It also puts an obligation on the issuing state to tell the executing state forthwith if it has lifted the freezing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 lays down a range of grounds on which freezing orders may not be executed. Those are generally technical or factual in nature—for instance, incompleteness in the special certificate or the existence of a privilege or immunity in the executing state. Provision is also made to cover cases where it is clear that to transmit the property in question to the issuing state would infringe the principle of double jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 contains provisions outlining the grounds for postponement of execution of a freezing order. It covers such circumstances as where such execution would damage an ongoing criminal investigation or where the property in question is already the subject of a freezing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 refers to the special certificate, the text of which is annexed to the draft, although revision will be required. It is a requirement that the certificate is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
translated into the official language of the executing state. Article 10 deals with what happens to the property or evidence after it has been frozen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11 deals with the important subject of appeals. It provides that appeals against the enforcement of a freezing order can be brought in either the issuing or the executing state by any interested parties. However, there are two important conditions. First, such remedies must be without suspensive effect, which is necessary to avoid giving the person in whose custody the material may be, the chance to conceal or destroy it. Secondly, the article provides that any appeal in the executing state must not relate to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"substantial reasons for issuing the freezing order",</p></blockquote>
which are for the issuing state alone to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 contains provisions regarding reimbursement by the respective states in the event that one or other of them has to pay damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a brief outline of the main elements of the document. I look forward to the debate, and I stand ready to try to reply to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that we have until 3.30 for questions to the Minister. Questions should be asked one at a time, and questions must relate to the proposal for executing the European Union orders freezing assets or evidence, and the detailed provisions in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister about a simple point of information? I am not a lawyer, and my study of Latin was rather a long time ago, so I am not absolutely sure what "ne bis in idem" means. Is it double jeopardy in Latin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not take Latin, but I am told that my hon. Friend is absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths (Reading, East)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having arrived a little late, Mr. O'Brien. There is possible ambiguity in the term "judicial authority". Could a war tribunal, for example, be considered to be a judicial authority in certain circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The judicial authorities are those that are currently engaged in the issuing of that documentation in other EU states. The main controversy arises within other judicial frameworks where there are—in Denmark, for instance—issuing authorities that have those responsibilities as well. The fundamental principle of mutual recognition is that we accept their system, as they are obliged to accept ours. We do not seek to impose our own standards on the people of Denmark or Scotland, and vice versa.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document refers to a number of human rights issues, such as discrimination, and freedom of expression and association, but there is no specific reference to the European convention on human rights as such. As that convention has been in existence for 50-odd years, and we are now playing with the idea of a European charter of fundamental rights, will the Minister explain why there is no specific reference to the convention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will see that article 1, taken together with the words in the preamble, refers specifically to the points that he has mentioned:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose of the Framework Decision is to establish the rules under which a Member State shall recognize and execute in its territory a freezing order issued by a judicial authority of another Member State. It shall not have the effect of amending the obligation to respect the fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union."</p></blockquote>
We believe that that, with the preamble, fully covers all the issues of ECHR compliance in relation to all the decisions taken within this framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 3.4 says that if an offence is not an offence in the executing state, the executing state may subject the recognition and enforcement to a condition. In other words, the executing state does not have to issue the freezing order if the offence is not an offence in that state. Who is to decide? What is the procedure? If a freezing order arrives for an offence that is not an offence in Britain, normally it would go through the judicial authorities, which would immediately execute it. What would happen in the case that I have described? What is the procedure for deciding whether to apply the order if the offence is not an offence in Britain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. This only applies, as he will see, to cases not currently in the list in article 3.2. Matters outside that list are an issue for us to deal with. In fact, very few cases for freezing assets abroad are successfully applied for, and despite the fact that there would be a desire on our part to co-operate over non-list issues, the power will rarely be used in cases that fall outside the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister a little further on an ambiguity in the document concerning judicial review? It seems to me that it is open to member states to determine what that concept means. There seems to be a possibility that, say, a police authority in Denmark or Finland being designated as competent to issue freezing orders, whereas that would not be the case in the United Kingdom or several other member states. Can the Minister throw some light on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the documentation says, the body would have to be a judicial authority—but there are states, such as Denmark, in which people who have judicial authority have policing responsibilities as well. As I have already tried to say, the principle of mutual recognition means that we accept that, and that decisions made in those states are taken correctly and are ECHR-compliant. That is what we buy into when we accept the principle of mutual recognition. Our own system has procurators fiscal in Scotland and a different system in England and Wales, so even our own two jurisdictions are not identical in terms of the powers that judicial authorities have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an individual is an offender in more than one state other than the state in which he or she lives—in the case of internet crime, for example— which is the issuing state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with evidence and property here, not offenders—although I know that there is another debate going on about the European arrest warrant, extradition arrangements and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The issuing state is the one that feels that, for the purposes of its judicial decision making, it requires evidence to be frozen and protected, so as to be able to ask for its return. The decision on whether it is eventually returned will be the subject of an application and mutual legal assistance, and will be dealt with as it always has been. The same will apply to assets. The issuing state will be the state that feels that there is a case for confiscation of assets held abroad, with regard to which it wants to bring a case in its own jurisdiction. The executing state is the member state within which those assets are located.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, in a very relaxed way, that of course that is what mutual recognition of judicial authorities means, and that is what we are buying into. Does he feel that British citizens who have been following with great interest the appalling injustice committed by a Greek court against the British planespotters would buy into the concept of mutual recognition in quite the same way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is never relaxed; the hon. Gentleman ought to be clear about that. I did not say what I said in a relaxed way, but in a practical way. To govern is to choose, as somebody fairly famous in my party once said. We have free movement of capital and labour within the European Union, and a framework of the European convention on human rights, with which all the countries are obliged to comply. We either accept that in the modern world, with the amount of free movement of people and assets that is possible, we cannot have effective jurisdiction, or we do something about it—and if we are to do something about it, I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept my contention that mutual recognition is preferable to any other methodology that I can think of. None the less, I would be happy to listen to any alternatives that he may propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are no further questions, I now call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 6980/02, draft Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence; shares the Government's view that the general thrust of the measure will improve the speed and effectiveness with which assets and evidence can be secured in cases of serious crime, acknowledges the amendments which have been included, largely at the Government's instigation to ensure that personal rights and freedoms are protected as far as is possible; and supports the Government's position on this measure.—[	<i>Mr. Bob Ainsworth.</i>]</p>
	<p>2.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The official Opposition do not agree with the motion, which says that the Committee shares the Government's view and supports their position. If it were simply the official Opposition who were saying that they did not support the Government, that would be no great surprise—but it is more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not mentioned the views of the European Scrutiny Committee, whose 23rd report outlines some serious concerns. Like all parliamentary Committees, its membership is dominated by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Government, yet its conclusions, on page 11 of that report, include the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We thank the Minister"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Minister who is with us today—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for his letters and Explanatory Memorandum. Whilst these are helpful in explaining the Government's attitude to this proposal, they give us cause for serious concern."</p></blockquote>
At least two of those concerns have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) in his questions to the Minister, but they were not appropriately answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that in the case of some very serious crimes there has always been a public interest in preventing the perpetrators of those crimes from salting away the proceeds of those crimes or disposing of evidence. Indeed, I may be the only member of the Committee who has been involved in such applications, which are known in the English courts as Anton Piller orders or Mareva injunctions, and in trying to ensure that assets were frozen and preserved to await the outcome of a case, so I understand the importance of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same issues as I have raised from the Opposition Bench in a recent, not dissimilar, debate about the European arrest warrant, arise in connection with what we are discussing today. The concerns raised by the European Scrutiny Committee echo several of the concerns that we, and some Government Members, expressed in that recent debate—such as the vague nature of some of the crimes that some overseas jurisdiction may decide should lead to one of those orders being granted. No British court would have the power to do anything about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that under article 11 of the document before us, anyone who may be on the receiving end of one of the new orders may be granted legal remedies, but without suspensive effect. In other words, the order will apply anyway, without anyone having the option to challenge it. It will simply take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the forefront of all our minds is the significant case of the British planespotters who have been outrageously arrested, charged and convicted. Most outrageously of all, they have been sentenced to imprisonment by a Greek court that simply had no understanding of a perhaps slightly eccentric but nevertheless entirely lawful activity. Nobody who has watched the progress of the case of the planespotters at Kalamata can have comfortable feelings about allowing the gradual process of accretion, of giving more and more powers to overseas jurisdictions to make orders binding on British citizens without anyone having the opportunity to challenge them.

As the Government-dominated European Scrutiny Committee has said, we have serious concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, but first I want to stress the Scrutiny Committee's conclusion about the European arrest warrant. Paragraph 1.27 of its conclusions, on page 12 of the 23rd report, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we do not consider that the relationship of this proposal with the seizure powers under Article 23a of the European Arrest Warrant is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
adequately explained. The provision in the European Arrest Warrant is not confined to evidence but applies also to property acquired as a result of an offence, so its subject matter is indistinguishable from the subject matter of a freezing order. Moreover, we do not find in Article 23a of the European Arrest Warrant, in the version deposited, any limitation to property which is 	<i>physically associated</i> with the requested person. The two provisions appear to us to have the same material scope, but to have different rules for such matters as appeals. This is notably the case for third parties, who have no rights of appeal under article 23a of the European Arrest Warrant where their property or rights may be affected. It may be that the problem has been caused by the last-minute insertion of Article 23a into the European Arrest Warrant, but we consider that the confusion which now arises should be resolved by the present proposal before it is formally adopted."</p></blockquote>
When a Government-dominated Scrutiny Committee expresses serious concern, a proposal lists "crimes" as vaguely described as "xenophobia", and we have recent evidence of the fact that foreign courts may act in a way that is wholly incompatible with all the traditions of British justice, we are bound to have huge concerns, and we ought to reject the idea out of hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has several times referred to the European Scrutiny Committee as "Government-dominated", but those of us who serve on Select Committees try to resist the idea that we are dominated by anyone, be that the Government or anyone else. Does he not accept that the report from which he has quoted is further evidence that Select Committees think for themselves? Secondly, in his questions to the Minister he appeared to oppose the principle of mutual recognition. Is he committing the Conservative party to renouncing that principle if it is returned to power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am simply saying that all the gradual processes of accretion of more and more powers give great cause for concern. As for Scrutiny Committees and other Select Committees, one always hopes that people will act with independence of mind, but when I say that the Committee is Government-dominated I mean, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that, because the Committees have to reflect the balance of forces in the House as a whole, the majority of their members take the Government Whip. It is therefore even more significant when a Committee—dominated, as they all are, by Government Members—expresses such serious concerns. Not one concern but three have been expressed; the others were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are concerned that there is still no clear provision requiring the issue and execution of freezing orders to be in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The language now proposed is vague and ambiguous".</p></blockquote>
Those are serious criticisms for a Scrutiny Committee of this House to make. The report goes on to say that the language contains
	<br><blockquote><p>"no express reference to the ECHR and referring only to discrimination, freedom of expression and freedom of association, thus giving rise to an arguable implication that recognition of a freezing order may not be refused on the grounds that it infringes any other rights guaranteed by the ECHR. If human rights are to be preserved by this proposal, we do not understand why it should not be stated in clear and simple terms that the making, recognition and enforcement of a freezing order are to be subject to the ECHR."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We are talking about quite draconian powers. People may turn out to be innocent, even of a serious crime. We are all aware that some people have been subject to miscarriages of justice. They have been accused of the most appalling crimes, but have turned out to be completely innocent. If such people are to have all their assets frozen, without any opportunity to challenge the process, that is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scrutiny Committee also repeats the concern that my hon. Friend raised with the Minister—that it is left to member states to determine what constitutes a judicial authority. I do not suppose that any Government Member would be terribly happy if that happened to them, or if a member of their family, or a constituent, were suddenly to ring them up in great distress one morning and say that as a result of some order issued by some Greek court that they had never heard of—in a place called Kalamata, for example— police officers had turned up, within the UK, to freeze all their assets. They would have no right to challenge what was happening, could not go to an English court to challenge it. Government members should make no mistake about the fact that that is what we are talking about. This is an opportunity for a foreign judicial authority—as my hon. Friend has rightly said, and as the Scrutiny Committee also mentioned, in a country such as Finland or Denmark, that may be a police or prosecuting authority—may issue an order, and nobody will have the power to challenge it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we think that this is a fundamental issue. The same problems arise as arose with the European arrest warrant. The list of crimes contains items that are very vague. In what was once called Republika Srpska, under the rule of the dictator and tyrant Milosevic, someone such as our present Prime Minister might have been accused of xenophobia. Anyone who has been following Milosevic's attempts to defend himself will know that he believes that he is right and everybody else is wrong. If he were in possession of the powers that we are discussing, he would be happy to the grounds of xenophobia to issue orders freezing the assets of people in this country whom he did not like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Republika Srpska is not on the list of countries that will have the opportunity to operate the system—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> But who knows? Can any Labour Member give an absolute guarantee that in future, another country that is a party to the system will not fall into the hands of somebody very unpleasant? After all, within the past few weeks we have all been surprised by the fact that an extremist politician, whose views all Members of this House no doubt disagree with and despise, got into the final round of a presidential election in a democratic country. That was a great surprise to most of the people of that country, and to the world's media, but it happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How confident can Labour Members be about the fact that in this Committee this afternoon, they are blithely intending to give powers to foreign courts in many jurisdictions, some of which have been under the control of dictators in the very recent past and may have returned to democracy relatively recently. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
giving powers to the leaders of those countries to say, "We are accusing somebody of xenophobia. We instruct our judicial and police authorities to issue freezing orders," and our police will have no alternative but to implement them, without the option of a challenge in the courts of England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Labour Members will follow the lead of their Minister and vote for the measure this afternoon, but I hope that they will pause and think, in the long watches of the night, about whether their consciences will trouble them if they vote those powers through without a bleat or a query, despite the fact that so many of their colleagues on the European Scrutiny Committee expressed such serious concern. I hope that they will be able to sleep with a clear conscience—but if I were them, I would not be able to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee too long, because my hon. Friend has already made many of the points that I wanted to make. I served on the European Scrutiny Committee for some time, and I do not think that it is particularly effective, but it does have a very good research team that works with it and looks deeply into many of the European Union proposals that the Government want us to pass on the nod.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore take the conclusions in the Committee's report seriously. There are three strong conclusions related to the matter before us. First there is the one that I raised in my question—the relationship with the European convention on human rights. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we do not understand why it should not be stated in clear and simple terms that the making, recognition and enforcement of a freezing order are to be subject to the ECHR."</p></blockquote>
The Committee's second point, about the concept of judicial authority, is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without the minimum safeguard of judicial involvement in and judicial oversight of the making of orders in the issuing State, we do not consider there is any proper basis for their recognition and enforcement in this country."</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty strong view from that Committee, which has considered the orders in some depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's third point, about seizure powers, was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we do not consider that the relationship of this proposal with the seizure powers under Article 23a of the European Arrest Warrant is adequately explained."</p></blockquote>
It concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we consider that the conclusion that now arises should be resolved by the present proposal before it is formally adopted."</p></blockquote>
The House set up a Committee to scrutinise in depth proposals that have been agreed to by Ministers in Brussels, and gave it the staff to consider them in detail, so we should take its advice seriously. That Committee's advice is that we should not adopt this measure, so this Committee should not, in the words of the motion, "take note" of it. We should reject it. I hope that the Committee will see fit to send the measure back to the Government today, so that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
can think again and renegotiate it in Brussels before bringing it before the House again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us put what we are talking about into context. I know that one can read across from some of these issues to the arguments that we have had about the European arrest warrant, but that is another debate, for another day. We are talking about the initial freezing of assets, not the transfer of assets out of the jurisdiction, or their return to other parts of the European Union or any other foreign jurisdiction. We are talking about the ability to respond to a request for the initial freezing of assets, and that is all. The decisions on their return would be taken when a request for legal assistance came through and was dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath ridicules the idea that although there will be appeal rights, they will not have substantive effect. What on earth is he asking for? When someone lodges an appeal against a decision, does he want that to have a suspensive effect immediately? If that happened, what would be the point of freezing the assets in the first place?. We had some similar debates during the passage of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, about our own ability to confiscate the proceeds of crime within our domestic jurisdiction. With the free movement of people and assets across the European Union that I thought all the main parties were in favour of, it is as easy to keep one's legitimate assets—and criminal assets, too— abroad as it is to keep them here. To give appeal rights an immediate suspensive effect would render the proposal utterly useless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People need to be aware of the real difficulties in dealing with cross-border crime. Under the present legal mutual assistance scheme, the number of restraints applied for is pretty abysmal, but since 1997 there has not been a single confiscation as a result of requests from abroad. In 1997 one confiscation was made, and in 1996 there was none, while there were three in 1995 and 1994. The number of outgoing requests is almost as unimpressive. It is widely recognised that in most circumstances there is little point in seeking confiscation of criminal assets placed abroad. That applies to incoming and outgoing requests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are satisfied with that and believe that it is acceptable, we should not take these measures. If we do not accept it, however, we should do something about it. In the Standing Committee on the Proceeds of Crime Bill, we had extensive debate about the ability to seize criminal assets in our own country. What is the point of taking the drug dealer's Surrey mansion from him if we allow him to swap it with a villa in Spain owned by a Spanish criminal? We would be able to take neither of them; we could not seize the villa owned by the Spanish villain in Surrey, nor the asset of the British national in Spain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition need to address the issue, because we cannot have a modern society with free movement without a legal framework that can deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, understandably, referred to our debates on the Proceeds of Crime

Bill, but would he have been happy to introduce the provisions of that Bill if it had included in its definitions of offences something as vague as xenophobia? That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that we have a choice about the approach that we take. We can accept that we have no effective judicial co-operation in areas of extradition, the European arrest warrant or the return of assets. We can accept that we need a Europewide legal framework, which would be highly problematic, contentious and impractical—or we can take the approach of mutual recognition. The Opposition are failing to address those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way, let me point out that we are talking not about countries such as Republika Srpska but about European Union countries, all of which have signed the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Select Committee recommendations. However, having read out article 1 in my opening speech, I shall read the preamble that should be read alongside it. I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Framework Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of Treaty on European Union and reflected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably Chapter VI thereof."</p></blockquote>
The preamble goes on to say that the framework decision may not be "interpreted as prohibiting refusal" in certain cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of ECHR compliance is covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is responding as if we only had the choice between rejecting the entire proposal out of hand or accepting it. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said in his excellent speech, the Government should take on board the serious concerns expressed by the Scrutiny Committee, a large majority of whose members belong to the Minister's party. They should send the proposals back, saying, "We are not prepared to impose these in their current form. They might be all right if you leave in all the serious criminal offences, but remove vague things such as xenophobia, and include the safeguards that the Scrutiny Committee recommended." The Minister is, however, brushing
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
aside the concerns and the unanimous report of a Committee that is dominated by members of his own party, as if such things did not matter. He refuses to contemplate renegotiation, and is simply saying that the proposals must go through in their current form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not seeking to show disrespect or to ignore anyone. The European Scrutiny Committee explained why it decided to provoke this debate, and I am responding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked about the list of offences in the context of the European arrest warrant. The principles of mutual recognition require us not to impose our framework of law on others, just as we would not expect or allow them to impose theirs on us. However, there is scope for much more co-operation than takes place within the current framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will give us an effective means of taking action against illegal assets in other countries, just as other European jurisdictions will be able to take action against assets held in our country. We will be able to co-operate on the return of evidence that is required to bring people to justice. I therefore commend the proposals to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
