	<div class='legislation'>Packaging and Packaging Waste</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the current state of play on the European Commission's proposal to amend the packaging and packaging waste directive. I should make it clear that the current proposal focuses primarily on recovery and recycling targets to be met in 2006. The Commission intends to publish a further proposal for a more comprehensive revision of the directive later this year. The second revision will examine issues such as re-use of packaging, minimisation of packaging and producer responsibility. It will also focus on the European Parliament's sixth environmental action plan and Green Paper on integrated product policy. The Department of Trade and Industry's explanatory and supplementary memorandums of 14 January and 11 February 2002 respectively, the latter of which included a regulatory impact assessment, explain the background and potential costs in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak about the proposed amendment to the directive. The Commission has proposed higher minimum and maximum targets within the range of 55 to 70 per cent. for recycling and 60 to 75 per cent. for recovery, and differentiated material-specific targets, all of which must be achieved by 2006. The inclusion of differentiated targets is a departure from current practice and for details I refer the Committee to the table on page 1 of the submission by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the House of Lords inquiry. The proposal also gives new definitions of mechanical, chemical and feedstock recycling of plastics, as well as a binding annexe categorising types of packaging, to increase conformity throughout member states. It should be noted that as a result of Environment Council working group negotiations the definitions are unlikely to be included in the common position text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, the European rapporteur, Dr. Dorette Corbey, has proposed changes to the Commission's proposal. The United Kingdom is keen to see its recovery and recycling rate rise, but is concerned that the suggested 80 per cent. recovery target could prove exceptionally challenging for the UK in the proposed time frame. We are also concerned at proposals to broaden the scope of the current revision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
I turn to the points raised by the European Scrutiny Committee. The European Commission suggested that the costs and benefits of the revision are broadly equal. The estimated costs to the UK during the next five years are difficult to calculate because they depend on making assumptions about the future costs of packaging waste recovery notes, which are market-driven by a range of factors, including the prevailing market price for recycled and virgin materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost to UK business of discharging the 2001 target of 50 per cent., of which 48 per cent. was achieved, was £70 million or—if Conservative Members do not mind my translating that—98 million euros, plus administration costs. That compares with the £36 million and £35 million to meet interim targets in 1999 and 2000 respectively. However, in Germany the cost in 2001 was 2 billion euros or £1·25 billion. The total additional costs to UK business between 2002 and 2006 of meeting the proposed targets in 2006—that is, 60 per cent. recovery—are estimated in the partial regulatory impact assessment to be in the range of £458 million to £656 million. For the estimated 14,000 obligated businesses, that represents an average cost of £7,000 to £9,000 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council will be at least 18 months late in agreeing the targets for 2006, and the UK is therefore seeking an extension of the time frame, for which there has been support from a number of member states. Extending the target date to 2007 would save UK business between £28 million and £35 million. By extending the date to 2008, we would be able to save between £68 million and £84 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK's producer responsibility regulations do not place costs on local authorities. Authorities have statutory recycling targets to meet, and we can expect them to plan to extract more waste for recycling— perhaps by increasing the incidence of kerbside-collection systems—to meet their targets. The experience of Peterborough city council, which is starting to establish a successful system, shows that, for every 100,000 households, it would cost about £500,000 to start up, plus £300,000 per annum to run the scheme. Further details of the Peterborough recycling cell can be found in annexe B of the House of Lords submission. We estimate that for every percentage point increase in the targets between 60 per cent. and 80 per cent., as proposed by Dr. Corbey, the total additional cost to UK business will be in the range of £23 million to £53 million. We are resisting the 80 per cent. target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To meet higher packaging waste recycling targets, there is now a greater need to extract additional packaging waste from the household waste stream and to develop recycling markets. The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment of 2002 targets of 59 per cent. overall recovery and 19 per cent. material-specific recycling reflects that. The not-for-profit company, the waste and resources action programme, with more than £40 million of Government funding over three years,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
forms an important part of the Government's policy to address the issue of developing markets. Estimates for additional infrastructure costs associated with packaging waste will vary significantly and are strongly linked to the overall targets, the material-specific targets and other factors such as the international market for some packaging materials. Other costs have been considered in detail in the regulatory impact assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the relevant issues in negotiation in the Environment Council working group, the European Parliament environment committee and the European Parliament itself. Some member states, and our rapporteur Dr. Dorette Corbey in her proposed legislative amendments of March 2002 to the Commission's proposal of 11 December 2001, have recommended increasing the minimum recycling and recovery targets and removing the maximum target. Although the UK supports challenging recycling targets, we are opposed to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very high targets suggested by Dr. Corbey would be very difficult and costly for the UK to meet in the time scale proposed. That is partly because of the need to extract more packaging waste from the household waste stream and the time lag involved in establishing new collection infrastructure. In addition, removal of the maximum target could result in an erosion of the single market. Moreover, removal of the maximum figure would ignore the fact that recycling has an optimum point, beyond which it is neither cost-effective nor environmentally beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the UK would like an initial revision to include an extension of the 2006 deadline to reflect the delays that have already occurred while the Commission has brought forward its proposals. We would also like targets for recovery and recycling that are broadly in line with those proposed by the Commission. We continue to have some doubts that differentiated, material-specific targets are a necessity, but we recognise the momentum towards that outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to questions, and I urge Members to keep questions brief; speeches come later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the industry, which is anxious to have sufficient time to make its plans to meet revised targets, I refer the Minister to the point about seeking an extension to 2007 before the measures are implemented. If the 2007 extension were agreed to, when would he envisage that conclusions on new targets would be reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point is that the extension that we are looking for is to 2008, not 2007. It is important to emphasise that the reason for the rationale is the 18-month delay that has already occurred in the Commission's introduction of its proposals. I hope that, certainly in the next few
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
months, we will have an outcome on whether we are likely to achieve that extension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What work has been carried out to measure the positive impact of the existing directive and the regulations made under it on reducing the generation of packaging waste and the use of packaging overall? Before we look at raising the targets, we should look at their effectiveness in achieving the environmental objectives that lie behind them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no point in setting targets unless they have proven benefits. I also agree with the need to measure them, and there is constant monitoring of the benefits and the results achieved. The environmental benefits include landfill avoidance, energy savings, conservation of natural resources and contribution to the national strategy for the more sustainable management of waste—in particular, the objective of increasing recycling. Those are all objectives delivered by the targets, and statistics are available on the results of them in other contexts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recovery rate of 60 per cent. represents the avoidance of 5·3 million tonnes of waste, 3 million tonnes of which would be household waste. The avoidance of landfill will also help to meet the targets in the landfill directive. The benefit up to 2006 to obligated businesses of landfill avoidance has been estimated at £80 million to £96 million. That is roughly £16 million to £19 million per annum. The estimated energy savings for industry—which are tangible benefits—from using recycled materials, essentially by burning them, are as follows: aluminium 95 per cent., plastics 80 per cent., steel 62 to 74 per cent. and paper 30 to 35 per cent. The value of those energy savings up to 2006 is estimated at £16 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another relevant, measurable benefit that has already occurred is that the growth in packaging used in our daily lives slowed to virtually nothing between 1998 and 2001.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister put Britain in the context of the rest of Europe? The briefing that we have received refers to other countries' concerns about the directive. How does Britain compare on the scale of ability to meet the targets? Which are the clean countries, and which the dirty ones, in that sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, we have a lot of catching up to do because we started from a very low base. A chart, which has been supplied to Committee members, gives the total recovery and recycling rates in member states in 1997 and 1998. That was a position that the current Administration inherited. On recovery rate, the United Kingdom languished at the bottom, with 26 per cent., rising to 33 per cent. in 1998. That put us behind, for example, Sweden, with 69 per cent., Austria with 66 per cent., Denmark with 84 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
and even Spain, the next lowest, with 37 per cent. We are now catching up on recovery and recycling, but there is a long way to go. Without the challenging targets, I have no doubt that we would have continued to lag behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To update those figures, recovery levels in the UK increased from 30 per cent. in 1998 to 48 per cent. in 2001. That puts our slight failure to meet the 50 per cent. target in perspective—our rate has none the less gone up. Recycling had increased from 27 to 42 per cent. by 2001. I cannot immediately supply comparable figures, but the trend is apparent. We have much further to go, but we have narrowed a wide gap and I hope that we will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the extension, which the Minister hopes will be given before the targets have been finally set, will the Government, in their pursuit to help industry make arrangements to play its part in meeting the revised targets, introduce interim targets that are above current levels but below those that could ultimately be agreed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have targets and we should get on with trying to achieve them. We had a slight shortfall, but it is important to achieve the targets and lay the ground for achieving more ambitious targets in future. Rightly, there will be a consultation this year on the possibility of setting more informal targets in 2003–04. Given the EU-led targets for 2003—and, I hope, for 2008—it makes sense to work internally for less formal targets in between to ensure that we move in the right direction in the interim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Stephen Hesford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the balance between short-term harm to industry and long-term gain for the environment is difficult to strike? Given that that is so, cross-party consideration and support should be given to the subject. What cross-party approach, if any, has he seen from other parties in assisting the search for that delicate balance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not wish to fall out with anyone. The issue has a cross-party history going back to 1994, and the process was in train when we came into government. There may be the odd bit of sniping or disagreement at the margins, but I have no reason to believe that the parties have fundamentally different approaches to the need for targets or for a substantial improvement in our record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I agree with my hon. Friend that the balance is difficult to get right. We are starting from a very low base, so we have an even stronger environmental imperative to do something. That does not detract however from the fact that the process involves cost, which we want to phase in order to maximise environmental benefits and minimise costs to industry. On the whole, industry has been supportive of that approach, on which there has been political consensus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) that I shall say something later about the degree of cross-party consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to turn his attention slightly. We are considering a proposal to increase targets with the knowledge that at a later date further proposals will be suggested that address other aspects of packaging, managing and minimising waste. Is the Minister confident that it is right for us to embark on a road in this piecemeal fashion of agreeing to higher targets without knowing what the Commission will propose for other parts of the jigsaw? Is he confident that the Government will be able to maintain their position, which effectively exempts the majority of small enterprises from the scope of the regulatory regime? We have 14,000 obligated businesses in this country, and it is essential that we maintain the focus on larger economic players and do not allow small and medium enterprises to be sucked in at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is more integration in the measures initiated by the European Union than the question implies because the issues are not compartmentalised. For instance, the present regulations include incentives for re-use and minimisation, and it is not as if each of those is coming forward under a separate heading. It is not the EU but the UK Government who will make the decision about SME exemption. It will therefore be up to us to decide whether we continue to do that, but I certainly have no interest in reversing that policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Luke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having read the documents, I hope that the targets are achievable over a period of time. Let us compare the current reprocessing and waste management system in this country with the systems in countries such as Germany. Does the Minister agree that the essence of those countries' success in recycling waste properly is the infrastructure of the companies involved in waste management? Can we do more in this country to encourage the growth of such companies? Germany has several large companies that deal with waste management, which operate over national borders. Would it not be wise to try to encourage similar growth in this country in order to hit our targets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. We have the bad habit in this country of looking at everything as a burden rather than as an opportunity, and these proposals are a classic example of that. By creating new responsibilities and targets, we are also creating a fantastic opportunity to expand an industry, which, as my hon. Friend has said, flourishes in other parts of the EU. On the other hand, we must be careful that that does not result in a duplication of effort, which occurs to some extent in Germany and clearly adds to cost. I know that my hon. Friend's background is in local government. Local authorities have a big role to play because they can run businesses in their localities that are both useful and profitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to develop the Minister's point about the role of local authorities. Meeting the targets will obviously be a matter of bringing together local authorities, Government and business. What does he intend to do to help local authorities meet those targets? How will he stop the many local authorities that are still using landfill? How will he improve the removal of recycled waste from waste bins on the streets of my constituency and those of other Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious not to start saying that that is not my responsibility but that of DEFRA, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, the Scottish Executive or whoever— although I have just done so. I am sure that members of the Committee will understand that if I pontificate about what local authorities should do, it would create difficulties because I would be straying into other Departments' responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that work through the Advisory Committee on Packaging has led to local authorities establishing their own targets for recycling, which are now statutory responsibilities. A lot of work is going on in that field, but we cannot send the message out widely enough that there is an awful lot more to do, and an awful lot more benefits if we do it. The separation of waste by the domestic consumer in a way in which is recyclable is, for instance, at a primitive level in most of the country. Anything that we can do to educate people and, even more importantly, make it easier in practical terms for them to recycle would be beneficial and would contribute to the targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tony Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert in this field, but it seems to me that the targets for specific materials must be kept in balance. There might be a problem if there were differentiations between wood, paper, plastic, glass and so on and, as a result, one industry became disadvantaged because people moved from one to another. Are the targets for the various materials that we are trying to recycle in balance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that we were actually opposed to differentiated material-specific targets but, as in all negotiations, one can see which way the wind is blowing. It appears that there will be a majority in the EU in favour of differentiated targets, so we must adapt to and accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Disaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that that would be a disaster. That is a rather cataclysmic response. We must adapt to and accept new challenges. However, this is a matter for negotiation, and we must negotiate in a way that safeguards specific sectors against threats of exactly the type to which my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham) referred. The Commission believes that it balances the costs and environmental benefits. Different materials have different environmental impacts, so the Commission
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
would say that it, too, is keenly aware of the need not to handicap any particular industry. From a domestic point of view, we must ensure that that is followed through in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that the targets were UK-wide, but he will be aware that a Scottish organisation, Wastepack, recently failed to meet its recovery obligations. Would he explain how he will ensure that the burden of the more exacting targets that are to be agreed will be spread evenly throughout the United Kingdom so that all parts of the country will be able to respond adequately? Can he tell us what mechanisms exist to ensure, as much as possible, a uniformity of approach, and can he relate that to the county level, where waste structures are currently in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right to refer to Wastepack. The Wastepack saga is a particular irritation to us, for the simple reason that it is the difference between our achieving 48 per cent., which is below the target, and more than 50 per cent., which would have been above the target. Again, I make the departmental point not to avoid the question but because I have to make it, particularly as the regulatory body involved in that instance is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wastepack is the second largest compliance scheme in the UK, with more than 500 members. Oddly, it is registered in Scotland with SEPA but based in Herefordshire, so, in a sense, it is a UK-wide body. DEFRA will be in touch with SEPA about why its compliance monitoring exercise, in accordance with the regulation, found Wastepack to be in default. The Government have said that they will discuss the regulations with the Scottish and Welsh devolved bodies to determine whether any changes are needed. The right hon. Gentleman's point about conformity and even-handedness of implementation and of regulation was well made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister about the Commission's methodology? There is considerable criticism in the European Scrutiny Committee's report and in Parliament's consideration of the measure of the methodology that the Commission has used, particularly for the material-specific targets. Can the Minister tell us what has been done in the UK to validate—or otherwise—the Commission's methodologies? The Commission has indicated what it calls optimal recycling rates of between 50 and 68 per cent. overall. Does the Minister agree that each domestic market within the European Union will have different characteristics and different marginal costs of extracting, recovering and recycling waste? How is he satisfied that that optimal recycling rate includes the rate that has been assessed as the optimal rate for the United Kingdom—given UK market conditions—and what work has his Department done in order to make us satisfied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission proposal is based on draft studies that were commissioned from two environmental consultants—Sofres and RDC/PIRA.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
Both acknowledge that their findings are limited due to time restrictions and the lack of comparative data across member states; they do not believe that they are the last word. We are all entitled to question the methodology, and my officials have done so on behalf of the UK. We have questioned a number of the assumptions in the methodology, including the estimates of costs to the UK, based on our own data and experience. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the process of questioning the methodology and the conclusion that it reaches is ongoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of that, we agree that the results broadly reflect the different costs of recycling differential materials. While I am willing to acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's broad point, I have been advised that the outcomes are not far adrift from our conclusions. I assure him that we shall continue the process of questioning the methodology and any results that we think would be unfair to the UK or to particular sectors within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The justification of much of the directive is its impact on the internal market. Can the Minister say what the comparative impact is across Europe on individual businesses? It is up to the member states to see how much companies charge for their contribution to the recycling process. Do British businesses pay more or less than our European competitors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not think that British businesses pay more, but I shall be pleased to supply the hon. Gentleman with more detailed data.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that credit could be taken for recycling by means of an energy result. If I have understood it correctly, that would involve a degree of waste being incinerated. Can the Minister tell us, in the context of incineration involving combined heat and power, what his Department is doing to overcome current public resistance to that form of waste disposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter overlaps with my energy responsibilities. What is common to all forms of energy generation is that someone will object to them. I defend people's right to object; all I ask is that they do not do so unreasonably or in a ritualistic way to every proposal. I cannot talk about specific cases, but all I would ask in general would be that, in making proposals, developers should be as sensitive as possible to community interests and that they should involve communities at the earliest possible stage to explain what they are doing and the benefits that flow from it. In that way, there is often a chance to give the majority of people—there is never unanimity—an understanding, so that they will support the work. If those basic steps are not taken, rumour abounds and entrenched opposition develops before a project is even at the planning stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government can do some work. I am not sure whether consultation on a review of planning law has begun yet—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Caplin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has begun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has begun, I am told. That has the energy implications of planning law in mind. Ultimately, acceptability depends on the reality and the perception of the project. In each case, the developer must be open. The story has to be a good one to win public acceptance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Energy savings come from not having to extract primary material, as it is recycled. Incineration is a separate policy issue. The energy savings that I mentioned did not flow from incineration, but I am pleased to have given an answer anyway on the issue raised by the right hon. Gentleman about planning acceptability for incineration and other energy projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow an earlier question about differential targets set for different types of materials recycled. Obviously, the lowest target is set for plastic. As a Member of Parliament and in my local government career, I have helped community groups to pick up rubbish from beaches and parklands. The largest amount of waste residue found in those sweep-ups is plastic containers and bottles. That is a big issue, so it is worrying that the targets are so low. I know that that is because there are technical problems in doing a good recycling job on plastic. Are the Minister and his officials aware of any research or investigation that would make recycling of such plastic much more amenable? Such research would help us raise the targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On implementation, I am sure that my colleagues in other Departments will note my hon. Friend's comments. I agree with his analysis that one of the biggest nuisance wastes is plastic. Quantitively, I suppose that a relatively modest proportion of plastic makes for a high quantity of waste, as it is one of the biggest sources of the problem. Some impact is being made on that problem, but there are economic and technical restraints on recovery and recycling of plastics. I am told that good progress has been made on the necessary technology. The incentive exists to make good progress in technology, because the proportions of plastic recovered each year are increasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred in his opening remarks to the significance of maximum targets in preventing distortions of the internal market. Will he clarify what he meant? The only interpretation that I could think of was that a green-dominated Government who set a 100 per cent. target for recycling, in the face of all the economic and cost-benefit logic, might seriously distort the operation of the market in their economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be the reason for the significance of the imposition of maximum targets. However, is not the range of targets suggested by the Commission intended to reflect the different optimum recycling levels and recovery levels in different domestic markets, because of their different structures? Is not the same danger liable to arise if a country whose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
optimum recycling or recovery percentage level is at the bottom end of the range, for political or other reasons, chooses to adopt a target at the top end, or vice versa? Is that not likely to create the same market-distorting effects as those to which the Minister referred when he mentioned the importance of overall maximum targets remaining in the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the reason for sticking to maximum targets is to avoid distortion of the market, but that is distortion not so much of the domestic as of the EU market. In other words, if a country has a very high rate of recycling and recovery, with which the domestic industry cannot cope, there is a spill over into other countries, which distorts the domestic targets of those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a member state needs to collect very high volumes, it might import them from other member states, that material not being available domestically. The maximum targets are intended to ensure that each domestic target is met and that there are not distortions caused by excessive cross-border transactions. A problem would arise if one country had high targets but no domestic market for recycling and therefore flooded other markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am making my point about that balance clear, but that is the thinking behind maximum targets. Exactly the same logic applies to the other issue that the hon. Gentleman raised. The important thing is to get the targets right, which is the subject of ongoing negotiation. Any excessive target, out of kilter with recycling capacity, would create exactly the sort of problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the explanatory memorandum, the Minister has helpfully provided a table to compare the United Kingdom's achievement of its recycling target in 2000 with the proposals for 2006. For metal, the current achievement is 30 per cent. and the target 50 per cent. The Minister will be aware of the difficulties currently faced in the UK over the recycling of refrigerators, which are largely metal. Part of the problem is that no identifiable revenue stream for recyclers has yet been devised to enable the growing fridge mountain to be disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the targets, can the Minister tell us what schemes he will encourage to get round the problem of the future disposal not only of refrigerators but of other domestic items—items for the ultimate disposal of which the consumer currently pays nothing? Such schemes will be central to meeting the enhanced target for metal recycling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to engage in departmental buck-passing, but I have to say that fridges are not us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But metal is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But metal is. I have no doubt that in all such matters there are lessons to be learnt from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
previous experience. The first point to make is that the directive is not something new, but a development of a well-established directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head but, as I said earlier, it dates back to 1994. We will need to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste, including metals, but the fridge issue is a problem not of metal recycling but of lack of treatment technology for the extraction of CFCs. We must not think of fridges, in so far as we think of them at all, as single entities but separate the metal content and the CFC content. The problem is with the CFC content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the Minister on that, because he may not have had the opportunity to read regulation 20/37/2000, article 16, parts 1, 2 and 3; otherwise, he may not have made the statement that he has just made. I accept his points entirely, but my first question is a general one. What mechanisms exist to enable Departments such as DEFRA, the Department of Trade and Industry and other parts of the UK legislature to sit down and discuss such problems together? The difficulties that have arisen over the negotiations on fridge disposal expose some poor cross-departmental communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that I should like to ask the Minister about. Accepting that fridges are metal, at the moment there is no identifiable revenue stream available to those who want to invest in the specialised recycling equipment for old refrigerators. I want to know how that revenue stream is to be developed in pursuit of those targets because that solution is not unique to refrigerators. It refers to the ultimate disposal of many other things under the waste electrical equipment directive, the end of life vehicle directive, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unhelpful, and I do not want to repeat myself, but my understanding is that the fridge problem is not one of metal recycling. Taking the right hon. Gentleman's logic and extending that point, the issues for metal recycling that arise under other directives, including this one, would not be a problem either. If he would give me the particular reference, I should be very happy to see whether there is any conflict between what it says and what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fridge problem is specific to the CFC content of fridges. It is absolutely fair to point out that there is not a recycling capacity for those, and maybe that should have been foreseen. Perhaps communications, either interdepartmentally or between Whitehall and Brussels, were inadequate. I am quite happy to discuss any of those propositions, but I do not see a read-across to a particular problem about metal recycling. I am, however, very happy to correspond with the right hon. Gentleman on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify how the negotiations on the compromise text, or the agreed text, are to be carried forward? Will he be progressing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
those negotiations with our European partners, or will it be the Minister for the Environment, at the Environment Council on 24 and 25 June? Will the Minister explain to the Committee the logic that has him here today dealing with the issues raised by the Scrutiny Committee if it is the Minister for the Environment who will represent the United Kingdom at the Environment Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter question is one that I have been known to ask myself. The rough answer is that the content of the directive is a Department of Trade and Industry responsibility and the implementation of the targets in the directive is the responsibility of DEFRA. The answer to the question about who will be at the Environment Council meeting is that it will be my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. Those lines are never clear-cut, and it is just one of the foibles of government that sometimes matters that would be more logically contained in one Department cross between Departments. That would be fair comment in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 14 of the Commission documentation, which was included in our briefing pack, I see that under article 6·5 of the current directive, some member states are allowed to postpone their attainment of targets. I wonder whether the Minister might comment on the fact that it appears that Portugal, Ireland and Greece are seeking dispensation? Member states should proceed in tandem. Why is the notion that those countries should have some form of derogation from the proposals being given sympathetic treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the point is that Portugal, Ireland and Greece are the member states that, alongside the UK, are looking for postponement until 2008. Certainly, the list of member states that he read out coincides with the ones that are with us in wanting that postponement. I hope that answers his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add that intelligence has reached me that aluminium scrap goes for £500 a tonne, so there is a market in recycling. If ever any of us is looking for a second career, we might take note of the fact that there is a very good price for secondhand aluminium just now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall send the Minister a copy of the Select Committee report on fridge recycling that we are currently writing. It becomes apparent on reading the papers that, if the enhanced targets are to be reached, local authorities will have to do much better at ensuring that the populace take their part in recycling. Will the hon. Gentleman say what his or any other Department is doing to ensure that some of the deficiencies of the so-called kerbside schemes will be more widely promulgated? He cited an example of good practice in Peterborough. At present, although good authorities produce good results, there does not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
seem to be much in the pipeline to drag the worst up to the standard of the best. What is being done about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross), there is a limit to which I can transgress into other departmental responsibilities. The promotion of kerbside collection is not my Department's responsibility. I am in favour of it, but I am not responsible for it. By promulgating best practice, we hope that others will follow such an example. We have a long way to go in this country to make it easy for ordinary citizens to participate in such schemes. Local authorities are responsible for making their schemes more proactive and imaginative. I am speaking as an individual citizen, rather than someone who is responsible for promoting the schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister speak as a Minister, not as an individual citizen? Is he really saying that he cannot come up with an idea that would reward authorities that are meeting their targets and, in some cases, exceeding them, and penalise and incentivise those who are not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to draw a distinction between what is my responsibility and what is not. Local authorities have the statutory responsibility to meet their own recycling targets, so they have to come up with schemes that assist them in that objective. Under current regulations, they also have a consumer information obligation to encourage the recycling of packaging waste. Compliance schemes are currently being devised by a wide range of local authorities. I am not saying that nothing is being done. Indeed, local authorities are under an obligation to undertake some of the tasks that I have mentioned. All I am saying is that if we are to meet more ambitious targets and if there is to be more individual citizen involvement, local authorities will have to be more imaginative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I sympathise with the Minister's difficulty in that we are talking about a cross-departmental issue, is not that absolutely essential to what we are discussing? We are talking about increasing targets to the point at which we will have to tap household waste streams as well as commercial and industrial waste streams. That will have serious cost implications. If I understand the position correctly, we are facing a step change in the level of costs that will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What detailed work have the Government done in mapping the cost curve so that we understand at what point the curve will start to steepen? The Minister has acknowledged that there will be a point beyond which it would not make sense to go in respect of recovering and recycling. There will be clearly be different points for different materials, but based on the Commission's proposals—both specific and overall—will the hon. Gentleman say what assessment his Department has made of the increased need to tap the domestic household waste stream? What percentage of recycling will have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
come from the household waste stream as opposed to the commercial and industrial waste stream? What are the specific cost implications of that? At what point will the curve start change shape? When will we run into significantly increasing marginal costs because of the need to tap the household waste stream?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we must do a great deal more in respect of the domestic waste stream. That is why local authorities have a role not only to implement those schemes, but to involve citizens in a more enthusiastic way, educate them in their individual obligations and explain why that is so important for wider environmental objectives. The nature of the hon. Gentleman's question implies the difficulty involved in answering it. We are talking about a range of different waste streams and the margin would occur at a different point for each. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman giving examples of particular waste streams and where each point may be. It is something of a moving target, however, and I cannot help him further today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tony Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be helpful. A scheme in Allerdale borough council in my constituency deals with fridges, freezers, microwaves and so forth. The local authority collects the items free and they are not scrapped unless they are in a terrible condition. They are taken away and repaired—they may need a new engine, door or whatever—and a shop sells them. Fewer fridges and freezers are scrapped, so there is less waste, and people are trained and employed to repair the goods. At the end of the day, relatively cheap fridges and freezers are available—for £30, £40 or £50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of recycling that avoids waste, creates jobs and provides people with something useful. It is the sort of model that should be repeated in other local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I remind hon. Members that we are discussing the packaging waste directive. Although the European Scrutiny Committee mentioned fridges tangentially, I would be grateful if hon. Members would stick to discussing the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that, Mr. Atkinson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend makes a helpful point, which is related to one I made earlier about seeing everything as a problem or burden rather than an opportunity. Certainly, I see the increasing separation of domestic waste for recycling and the requirement to meet targets in the recycling of domestic waste as a really big opportunity, not a burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the previous point, DEFRA's advisory committee has published the figures that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) seeks, not on specific waste streams, with which I have already promised to help him, but on the amount of domestic waste that we would have to recycle in order to meet our target. The cost implications are in the regulatory impact assessment.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
I am happy to supply any supplementary information that he requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend, we cannot separate local authorities from other players in the field. It is important for local authorities and business to work closely together to maximise the opportunities that arise. The organisation CREATE is currently working with the Government to ensure that equipment continues to be reused. CREATE is a social economy organisation that offers training and sells on white goods, which is an imaginative illustration of what my hon. Friend mentioned. Interesting and creative ideas will result when one focuses more clearly on what can be done with domestic refuse and waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reassure me that the United Kingdom will not agree to enhanced targets until there is a clear breakdown of the proportion of waste that will have to be recycled by improved domestic arrangements and commercial waste management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the sort of issue that is still under negotiation. Everything that I have said suggests that we do not want British businesses or consumers to be disadvantaged or to bear costs that are disproportionate to the benefits. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that we are being asked to approve not a done deal but our negotiating line. I hope that everything that I have said about the negotiating line and the criteria that I describe command the Committee's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I seek your guidance. You rightly asked us not to deviate too far into a single-minded debate on refrigerators, but in paragraph 2·6 of the 19threport of session 2001–02 of the European Scrutiny Committee, which was included in the papers provided, specific reference is made to the disposal of refrigerators. I presume that it is in order to discuss the contents of that paragraph subsequently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like me, the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt have read the paragraph carefully. As I said, the matter is referred to tangentially. I was happy to tolerate a debate that involves the question of refrigeration, but we do not want the entire debate to focus on that issue. If hon. Members do so, they will be called to order. That brings us to the end of the time allocated for questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 15194/01, draft Directive amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste; welcomes it as a positive step towards achieving high levels of environmental and single market protection, whilst limiting the impact upon UK business; and supports the Government's negotiating line.—[	<i>Mr. Wilson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that it is some time since I served on a European Standing Committee, although such Committees were one of the great joys of my

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
early years in this place. I had expected the Minister to speak again, and I looked forward to further elucidation, but that is obviously not to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the debate is the existing directive, which I believe came in force in 1994. It was always envisaged that the targets would be reviewed, and, almost inevitably, I suppose, increased, after five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has been rather tardy in presenting its proposals, and some criticisms of its methodologies made by member states and other observers may explain why. Will the Minister comment on member states apparently tolerating the Commission's tardiness even though the Commission has not always been so tolerant of tardiness by member states when they are supposed to adhere to a timetable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals seem to do two things that are important to discuss. They impose higher targets for recovery—up to 60 to 75 per cent. for packaging materials—and for recycling, which is 55 to 70 per cent. They also impose material-specific targets, which I expected the Minister to say the Government are committed to resisting, but judging from his earlier remarks the Government may have conceded that point already, which many hon. Members will consider a serious development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of consensus on the issue has been referred to. I should like to believe that there is an underlying, cross-party consensus, as long as we eliminate the most extreme approaches at both ends of the spectrum. Regardless of political party, I suspect that most hon. Members want sensible recovery and recycling when the costs are not disproportionate to the benefits achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to believe that in a frank and open debate, most hon. Members would regard the issue as involving the UK's interests and the approach that Britain takes to dealing with such problems as well as how we ensure that that approach receives a fair hearing in the wider European context. It sometimes seems that some of what is proposed there goes against the grain of how we would approach the problem here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, there is a party political gloss on the issue. I sometimes get the impression when we discuss matters involving the European Union and the European Commission that Labour Members feel it necessary to defend the actions of those bodies. Equally, my hon. Friends sometimes attack them regardless of the substance of the issue. I suspect that much party political posturing on this issue is related to the parties' general approach to matters emanating from Brussels rather than the substance of the proposals before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Stephen Hesford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about extremes. Will he characterise the American stance on Kyoto, and is it at the extreme of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
spectrum? Does he agree with the US approach? It would argue that it is on all fours in protecting its interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing a European directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I shall not be drawn on the hon. Gentleman's question, he raises an important point. I have a reference to Kyoto in my notes, but I shall pass over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we carry public opinion with us on these matters. I am not an expert on American public opinion, but I am quite certain that it is behind the stance that the American Government have taken. We must be alert to the possibility that public opinion will turn against the recycling and recovery agenda if we seem to advocate approaches in which the costs are disproportionate to the benefits achieved. We must bear that in mind as we discuss the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members, including the Minister, talked about the cost burden that the measures place on industry. He is familiar with my point of view, as he has heard it before: the cost burden is not on industry, but on consumers, and the question is how the burden passes via the intermediary of industry to the consumer. It is important that we are careful to take stock of the effectiveness of the legislation and regulations in place before we go further down the route of increasing targets and increasing recycling and recovery. The Minister has already agreed with me on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the documents that members of the European Scrutiny Committee received would tell us more about the effectiveness of the existing directive and the mechanisms in place in the UK to allow us to study its ongoing effect. We would have known what has happened and what will happen when the targets come into effect, thereby providing us with a basis on which to deal with future reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initially, the proposed increased targets will affect some 14,000 obligated businesses in this country, although ultimately we will all be affected. We must consider the financial and, in particular, the marginal costs of raising targets. I asked the Minister a question about the changing shape of the cost curve as we seek to recover and recycle ever-higher percentages of material. The partial regulatory impact assessment indicates the anticipated costs of meeting certain specified recovery and recycling targets. I would have liked to see a more refined analysis showing how the costs would change as the percentage target moved, perhaps percentile by percentile, so that we could be sure that the UK sets appropriate targets. I hope that the Minister has one locked away in some private study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unnecessary to enter a complex cost-benefit analysis discussion, because a quick look at the cost curve readily indicates the approximate range where we should set a target to ensure that we secure economically achievable environmental benefits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
rather than move into an area where costs become disproportionate to benefits achieved, thereby risking the public opinion reaction to which the hon. Member for Wirral, West referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also alert to the feeling in industry that the current regime for dealing with producer responsibility obligations is bureaucratic and over-embellished. The Engineering Employers Federation has given me a briefing:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Compliance with the regulations in the UK requires setting up a sophisticated data tracking system … Companies have to record packaging types and weights associated with each product they make—and in many cases they can have thousands of product lines."</p></blockquote>
They also have to account to the Environment Agency for
	<br><blockquote><p>"changing product mixes, company divestments and acquisitions, and constantly changing recycling costs and targets."</p></blockquote>
Furthermore:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Environment Agency compliance audits are detailed in the extreme, expecting to see calculations for individual products and calibration records for weighing equipment."</p></blockquote>
My experience of the EA, which I suspect is also that of other hon. Members, is that it is under-resourced for dealing with the real problems that face our constituents. Therefore, it is alarming that the EA has such large manpower resources to fuel that bureaucratic process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated a different aspect of waste reprocessing last week, so I know that the Minister is, in general, anxious to ensure that we use methods that bolster and exploit existing market mechanisms, rather than overlaying tiers of bureaucracy in complex organisational structures, to promote recovery and recycling. I hope that he ensures that they involve a lighter touch as we modify the current regime to move forward to meet those higher targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to ensure—as is the Minister, no doubt—that we genuinely achieve net environmental benefits when we impose targets such as those under discussion. I remember that not so many years ago it was the custom for boy scouts to knock on front doors and collect newspapers and magazines, which they sold for recycling. Judging by the facial expression of the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), perhaps that happened more than a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I remember when voluntary organisations generated funds by collecting newspapers and selling them for recycling. I recently inquired why nobody does that any more. The answer is that the large amount of recycled packaging material in the system has so depressed waste paper prices that it is no longer economically attractive to recycle other forms of paper. Clearly, we would score an own goal if we established elaborate systems with high targets to ensure that we recycle ever-more cardboard packaging, only to discover that we have done so at the expense of other forms of reprocessable paper waste, which are no longer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
economic as a result. Some forms of recycling have direct environmental costs. They require additional transport, and energy is used for the transformation process, creating greenhouse gas emissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pushing at a door which is not ajar, but open, when I urge the Minister to ensure that the proposed recycling targets are set at a level that will create unambiguously positive net environmental benefits. The ratio of the benefits to the economic costs must be clearly positive, and those matters must be crystal clear and beyond doubt. Otherwise, public confidence in the drive to increase recycling and recovery will be shaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, I am worried about the disquiet that has been expressed on the methodologies used to assess the costs and benefits. The Commission documents caution a wary approach to the costs and benefits, which is reflected in the Government's publications on the matter. It is clear in all the documents that those figures are extremely difficult to assess. Having said that, the issue between costs and benefits is presented as broadly neutral. Pushing for ever higher targets when the methodology underlying the analysis is clearly suspect and even the person promoting it appears to be claiming only that the costs are broadly in line with the benefits is perhaps a rather unusual direction for the Minister to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test that we ought to apply is how, for a given financial cost, our environment can best be enhanced. The information that has been presented does not convince me that increasing the packaging recycling and recovery targets is the best use of the marginal few hundred million pounds that we are about to spend to protect our environment. Has the Minister conducted any cross-scheme analysis on whether that £400 million—it may be £500 million or £600 million—could be spent on ways of providing measurable benefits and protection of our environment greater than any achieved by the proposed increased targets for the packaging recycling scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I began our parliamentary careers on a European Standing Committee, so it is not the first time that we have exchanged opinions. His speeches are no shorter, but I will forgive him on this occasion, because he is making a good deal of sense. Given the hon. Gentleman's comments about the uncertainty of the costs and the impact on industry, does he agree that it is important to ensure that the directive is enforced throughout the European Union in a way that does not create an unequal competitive impact in this country, compared with others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. He has raised a separate issue, which is also important. He may not have been in the Room earlier when hon. Members asked the Minister questions in order to ascertain how certain we in the United Kingdom are that the range of targets set by the Commission is appropriate. The Minister was also asked what mechanisms are in place to ensure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
that the right targets are chosen for each domestic economy and that each carries a similar share of the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point that seems important is the extent to which the proposed change takes us over the threshold to a different part of the cost curve so that we have to tap a higher proportion of the household waste stream in order to meet the new target. That is the crux of the matter, and it is not a question that I, or maybe even the Minister, can answer. However, it must be analysed in detail before deciding whether the target range is correct and what the United Kingdom's individual target should be. The general thrust of what I and others have said is that we must not allow ourselves to move into a part of the cost-benefit curve that is neither justifiable nor sustainable to public opinion. I fear that we are moving toward that, and we may find that we are required to set up elaborate household collection and separation systems to reach the marginal few per cent. in order to meet the targets. That would have significant marginal cost implications. I have not seen anything in the published documents to suggest that the matter has been analysed in sufficient detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was stunned by what the hon. Member for South Thanet said about the length of my speeches. Of course, the occasion to which he referred was before routine timetables when Opposition Members on Standing Committees needed to learn to speak at great length from the scantiest of materials. Indeed you, Mr. Atkinson, will remember such delightful times as those spent on the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill. However, as I was so stunned by what the hon. Gentleman said, I shall draw my remarks to a speedy conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to urge his right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment to press vigorously for the delay that is wanted universally by industry in this country and by many other member states, and to resist the material-specific targets that will be imposed in view of the questionable methodology that the European Commission adduced in support of them. I ask the Minister for the Environment to ensure that the directive allows us to maintain maximum flexibility in interim targets before we reach the targets that are ultimately set for 2006 and 2008, and to maintain the market-based system for the pricing of recycling obligations. Most importantly, I ask the Minister for the Environment to ensure that the UK makes it clear that we insist on retaining the right to exclude permanently small and medium enterprises from the scope of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister for Industry and Energy said that that is not included in the current directive and that it is, therefore, a matter for the UK. I accept that there is no immediate likelihood of the UK Government choosing to remove the derogation for small and medium enterprises. However, the next set of draft directives might include moves by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
European Commission to prevent the exemptions for small and medium enterprises that the Government have put in place. We must resist that strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share an objective of wanting to ensure that all environmental policy is soundly based and proportionate in terms of costs imposed and benefits delivered. We want to ensure that the policy genuinely produces significant environmental benefits rather than being merely based on gesture politics that respond to specific agendas from environmental pressure groups in the European Union. I believe that if we approach the measures in a proportionate and measured way, we will slowly build public support for recycling and recovery as a reasonable cost approach to a real problem. There is a degree of fragility to the consensus of public opinion—the American example is a good one. We will lose public support if we appear to impose unnecessary or disproportionate costs to achieve marginal, unquantified or unmeasurable environmental benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. The debate has been useful, but it is a shame, because this is a cross-departmental debate and we cannot get answers to some of the questions that we would have liked to ask. It is the implementation that is crucial to so many of the issues debated by the Committee and which has the greatest impact on British industry, not the targets. The targets may be laudable, but their implementation and the civil service's interpretation of them will determine whether we are put at a disadvantage compared with our competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is right to say that there are difficulties in relation to public perception and a possible public resistance to some of the targets. I hope that the Minister will agree that there is a need for Government investment in an education programme about the need for recycling. It is important that people understand that the planet has only finite resources. We cannot keep digging holes to get stuff out of the ground and then dig more holes to put stuff in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large landfill site in my constituency has recently become a local problem. Unpleasant smells were generated after heavy rains and many people in neighbouring villages were very upset. We must get away from such a method of disposal. I hope that the directive will help us to reduce the amount of landfill and get us back to more productive means of waste disposal. In that sense, it should be welcomed. We should see the directive not in the context of those who favour or are opposed to Europe, but as part of the international agreements such as Kyoto that try to limit environmental damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A delegation from the European Parliament recently visited the landfill site at Heathfield to examine the environmental impact of foot and mouth, because some culled sheep were disposed of at the site. The Danish delegate was horrified that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
site was so large—over so many acres—and to see so much waste being put into the ground. His comments clearly suggested, "We would not do this in our country." It is a great shame that Britain has lagged behind in recycling for so many years. It is an indictment on previous Governments that they did not take recycling or environmental policies sufficiently seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we lag so far behind and that we are catching up with our main competitors means that most of what we discuss will have little competitive impact on British industry. However, it is important that the costs to UK businesses are not disproportionate to those faced in other countries. I appreciate that the Minister said that he would write to me about the comparative costs. I hope that he will tell his Department and DEFRA—when it comes to implementation—that costs must not be greater for UK businesses than for our competitors and the methodology must not be more complicated. The civil service should consider a red tape audit when implementing European legislation and compare the bureaucracy of our competitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but would he acknowledge that our competitors are not only European Union countries, but include countries outside the EU, which do not have to comply with this type of regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but that is all the more reason for international agreements such as Kyoto. The majority of our trade in that sort of packaging is with Europe, and the competitive edge for most of our businesses is in Europe, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the proposals are to work, there must be cultural change and education on the subject, as I have said. We cannot make changes unless our local authorities are given the assistance and motivation to do so. It is no good for the Government to set targets and send them down to our county councils, saying "You must meet this target," when county councillors are struggling to ensure that they have bed places for elderly people, homes and support for children and enough social workers. Those matters have a high impact on counties, which consider environmental issues to be on the margins. The Departments should ensure that county councils have the cash and incentives to comply. If that means setting specific budgets for capital projects, I hope that the Departments will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first put on record my thanks to the Minister's parliamentary clerk, who made available in good time a comprehensive and well laid-out briefing for the debate? That is much appreciated, because in the past we have not always had briefing in sufficient time to read and understand it, let alone to receive other valuable opinions about the proposals to which it refers. Secondly, I apologise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
to the Committee and to you, Mr. Atkinson, for my enthusiasm for fridges. Having consulted and reexamined annex 1 of the regulation, I find that refrigerators are certainly not in the packaging items listed to help us to define what is covered and what is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intriguing to look at the detail in annex 1 and find out how tricky the issue is. Obvious things such as paper and packaging on a retail product are included, but chip forks are not. I foresee great practical difficulties in implementing the proposals if we are to go into the nitty-gritty of what is included and what is not. That perhaps illustrates the complexity of the matter. I am glad that the Minister has taken a practical and pragmatic approach. Hon. Members have outlined important points on matters on which the Minister will be involved in negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had consultations with the trade, particularly Valpak, which makes it clear that an early resolution of the targets would be helpful, and that attention should be paid to local authority waste schemes. Valpak kindly provided me with some information that illustrates the variation across the United Kingdom in the effectiveness of the methods of dealing with waste that will play an ever-increasing role in meeting more exacting targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the Minister has frequently had to apologise slightly, in a kind and courteous way, for not been able to deal with other matters connected with waste because they fall into the province of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I serve on the Select Committee that monitors that Department's activities, and I am beginning to learn more about the problems associated with waste. The Committee is about to embark on an inquiry into the subject, and joint witnesses may well be required. It would be helpful to have some better indication of how matters are being co-ordinated across not just Government but the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I respect the uniqueness of the different legislative arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we are discussing United Kingdom targets. As hon. Members have mentioned, it is important that all sections of the UK play their part in meeting the exacting targets, and that policy is properly co-ordinated. That is where the question of refrigerators is relevant, because the evidence that was taken by the Committee that I chaired indicates that there were deficiencies in co-ordination between different branches of Government, which led to a failure to realise the scope and scale of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
This has been a useful debate. I congratulate the Minister for being pragmatic and practical, and I hope that he can achieve further improvements in the way that we tackle enhanced targets, when they are agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief contribution, as I have been involved in these matters for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe is often a dirty word to many hon. Members, but it has a clean track record and plays a positive role in setting targets for waste management. Many of the companies that are involved in waste management are international organisations. As a result of competitive tendering, many companies that are based on the continent operate contracts to pick up waste in English cities. With regard to packaging, because of the freedom of movement of goods and services across European borders, waste that is dealt with here might have been produced abroad, so a co-operative approach is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the targets that we have set. However, I also agree that it is necessary to extend the deadlines. There has been progress, but a great deal more progress must be made. I have discussed the matter with many people in my part of Scotland, so I know at first hand that a lot more collaborative work needs to be done, especially with regard to looking at using new technologies to create new ways of dealing with waste materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the issue of plastics. Our streets and parks are awash with different types of plastic, such as bottles. I took part in an exercise to collect different types of waste and packaging; we collected an immense amount of empty plastic bottles in one morning on a beach in Dundee. If we cannot tackle the problem of surplus refuse, we will face a frightening future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the national and devolved Governments must play their part by encouraging waste management operators and local government authorities throughout the UK to develop best practice with regard to handling this type of work. The Minister has a strong track record in Scotland, as is indicated by his previous ministerial appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My city has a strong track record. It was the top recycling city in Scotland, if not in the entire UK. It has slipped from that position, because of changes in the market and a lack of focus at times, but it continues to work hard. There are clear divergences in the way that different local authorities manage such matters. That is also the case with regard to home energy, which I have discussed with the Minister; some councils have excellent track records on that. We need to reproduce that success, so that all local authorities hit their targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, there is a need to encourage more collaborative efforts between the private sector, local government and devolved Administrations to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
that the planning is in place. My big fear is that, although we set targets, there is no infrastructure to enable them to be met. I know that that is the case in my area, although the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has played a positive role. We have talked about Wastepack: it is an English company that operates north of the border, and I have had discussions about schemes that it wanted to put in place to make recycling more manageable and more accessible to citizens. Such local area waste management plans should be produced throughout the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, there are problems. The point has been made that in order to hit the targets, we will have to tap domestic waste streams in a much bigger way. However, some local authorities that have developed waste energy incinerating strategies are under contract to give all their domestic waste to a privately owned incinerating company, and they would face penalties if they did not continue doing so. Therefore, problems would be caused if that waste were recycled rather incinerated. These difficulties must be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should delay the targets and put back the deadlines. The targets should be welcomed and I hope that a delay would allow for a more comprehensive approach. We all hope that the targets will be hit because we must work comprehensively to address the big problem in cities throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and interesting debate and I am grateful to all hon. Members, who contributed in a constructive spirit. There is agreement on the need for the measures, and questions asked were about implementation and practicalities rather than the ultimate objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members recognise that progress has been made. This is not a party political point because the process began in 1994, but in 1997 we recovered only 30 per cent. of packaging waste, which was approximately 3 million tonnes. By 2001, that amount had increased by more than 1 million tonnes to 4·5 million tonnes. Equally importantly, the increase in the quantity of packaging stopped during that period and, consequently, we are discussing a fairly static target rather than one that is constantly rising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pick up on several of the points that were made. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge placed much emphasis on cost-benefit issues. I have said that I shall make further inquiries into whether I can give him figures on the point at which it becomes uneconomic to recover or recycle each specific material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is not only about economic cost-benefit analysis. The motivation that underlies it includes a contribution to our climate change objectives, to sustainable development, to improved resource productivity and to the Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
overall waste strategy. The cost-benefit analysis is fair enough, but it must be conducted on broad terms as well as with regard to narrow economic factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that in addition to the economic cost-benefit analysis, an environmental cost-benefit analysis must be conducted? The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke) mentioned the problems of recycling plastics. Is one such problem that recycling several plastics is environmentally costly due to energy consumption and the production of greenhouse gases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is part of the reason why the proportion of plastics that should be recycled is lower than that of other materials. On the other hand, how wide does one draw the cost-benefit analysis? My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East implied that plastic lying about all over the place causes a major intrusion on people's lives and their enjoyment of society because beaches are covered with plastic and a person cannot walk down a street without plastic bottles and packaging lying about. If we can tackle that, a cost-benefit analysis would show that there would be benefits that were not necessarily economic, but social and environmental.

I remember meeting with a company called Anaplast, which is based just outside my constituency. The company had developed a scheme, which was almost a sideline, to collect fertiliser bags from farms. The company was reprocessing those bags into black plastic sacks. That was a large scheme for a while, although I do not think that it survived. I was astonished to learn that farmers simply bury huge numbers of fertiliser bags in the ground. If there is no way of reprocessing them, there is a cost. That cost might not be economic, but it is not clever to dig a hole and to throw thousands of heavy plastic bags in it. There are wider issues at stake. The scheme is not just a good thing in its own right because it makes a wider contribution.

I agree with the hon. Member for Teignbridge and my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East about the role of local authorities. There is much scope to learn from best practice. I do not know whether I am technically qualified to send out that strong message, but it cannot be ignored. Councils cannot continue their traditional methods and behaviour, and it makes sense for them to look for commercial opportunities and partnerships with the private sector to develop businesses that will be beneficial economically and will enable them to deal effectively with such materials when the measures are in place. I hope that there is a widespread realisation among local authorities that they face a major challenge.

The hon. Member for Teignbridge asked about information packages and teaching the public. The packaging directive requires us to explain the motivation and purpose behind it. The forthcoming WEE directive—more terminology with which we shall become familiar over the next year or so—and the end-of-life vehicles directive have the same public information requirements. There is much work to be done in getting such messages across to the wider public and we are all ultimately responsible for participating in that process.

The right hon. Member for Fylde referred to co-ordination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Across the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. No matter which Government are in office, one Department cannot be responsible for everything, although there will be cross-boundary issues. Obviously, it makes sense to work closely with other Departments and I am sure that my officials work closely with DEFRA. Given the devolved responsibilities to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it is important that people are involved both at governmental level and with agencies that are charged with delivery of the directive throughout the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reiterate the UK Government's commitment to the exemption for small enterprises from the effects of the directive and their intention to fight vigorously to defend that exemption should it come under attack from the Commission or elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the policy of the United Kingdom Government that small and medium-sized enterprises should be excluded from the effects of the directive. In fairness to the European Union, there is nothing to suggest that it is about to challenge that policy.

We have scrutinised the directive and I have explained our strategy for its implementation. I am grateful to members of the Committee for the way in which it has been discussed and I am glad that we have finished in time to see the European cup final.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 15194/01, draft Directive amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste; welcomes it as a positive step towards achieving high levels of environmental and single market protection, whilst limiting the impact upon UK business; and supports the Government's negotiating line.</p></blockquote></p>
