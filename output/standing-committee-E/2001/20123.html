	<p>	<i>[Relevant documents: European Union document No. 5330/01, Audit of management of external aid programmes; European Union document No. 7131/01, Euro-Mediterranean co-operation on transport and energy; and Unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 24th April 2001 submitted by the Department for International Development on Council Conclusions on ECA Report on assistance to Palestinian Society.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two Ministers are present, but I understand that only one of them intends to make an opening statement. I call Mr. Hilary Benn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Amess; I am glad to see you in the Chair this morning. I hope that the Committee will enjoy the fact that it has two Ministers for the price of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first document to which the motion refers is the Commission communication, "Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process". The Government welcomed that communication. It provided an analysis of the five years since the Barcelona declaration in 1995, and suggested useful ways forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to what I believe are the achievements of Euro Med. The European Union is close to concluding association agreements with all the Mediterranean partners, and it continues negotiations with Syria. Even in areas of trade that are traditionally protected by the EU, we have opened our markets to our Med partners. Last year saw the agreement of further agricultural liberalisation with Tunisia, a similar agreement is being negotiated with Israel, and I hope that the EU will soon begin negotiations with Morocco. Furthermore, the EU/Lebanon association agreement provides more liberal access to the EU market for Lebanese agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Multilaterally, the Barcelona process continues to take small but useful steps. Since the November 2000 Marseilles conference, when Syria and Lebanon stayed away in protest at the situation in Israel, officials from all 27 partners have met regularly. The last meeting of Foreign Ministers in Brussels in November 2001 saw ministerial attendance from all partners. Against the backdrop of the previous year's boycotts, that was an achievement. The Barcelona process remains the only instrument where representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab nations meet regularly to discuss issues of mutual interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
However, there are areas where progress has been less good. Ratification of the association agreements is slow, and we need to ensure that such agreements receive parliamentary scrutiny without inordinately delaying ratification. The Government therefore support the Commission's request for ratification of agreements within two years of signature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charter for peace and stability remains an aim rather than one of the achievements of the Barcelona process. The European Scrutiny Committee asked whether such a charter was over-ambitious. Perhaps it was, but it was worth a try and the partnership can return to it when the time is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the Government believe that the Barcelona process continues to play a useful function in bringing the various parties in the region together. Progress has inevitably been faster in some areas than others, but as the EU's experience shows, enhanced economic co-operation can create prosperity and foster security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second document to which the motion refers is the special report by the Court of Auditors on the management of EC assistance to the Palestinians. The United Kingdom welcomes that assistance, which is an important component of a broad international effort. It includes bilateral support from a number of member states, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complex and volatile political situation has created a difficult working environment for international donors, including the EC. However, support must continue in response to the worsening social and economic conditions caused by the current crisis. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line has risen during the intifada from 21 per cent. to 35 per cent. The Palestinian economy shrank by 8.2 per cent. in 2000, and unemployment has risen from a low of 10 per cent. in September 2000 to more than 28 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About one third of my Department's funds are directed to the EC, and that UK contribution forms about 19 per cent. of its aid budget. We therefore have a strong interest in ensuring effective EC support for the Palestinians. We fully endorsed the Court of Auditors report and the resultant comprehensive programme of reform, which began last year and is continuing. Those reforms include focusing on poverty reduction and creating more streamlined structures and better management arrangements, but improving the quality of staff and progressing delegation, both of which are crucial, will require more time. We shall monitor progress closely, working with the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and other member states to ensure its success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the UK Government are firmly committed to both the Euro-Med process and the EC's programme of assistance to the Palestinians. Ensuring the effectiveness of both is a high priority, which we take seriously and will continue to work to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to Ministers. I remind hon. Members that they should be brief, and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
Members to ask several questions. It will be for the Ministers to decide which of them should respond to each question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Roger Casale	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's remarks, and the continued support that the British Government is giving to efforts by the European Union to deliver aid to the Palestinian Authority. Does he agree that although there are difficulties in delivering that aid, not least because of problems with the management structures and with the political situation, it is more important than ever that we reinforce our efforts to underpin the Palestinian Authority, as a critical element in our attempt to stabilise the current crisis in the middle east?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The additional support that the Palestinian Authority is receiving is, in part, to compensate for the withholding by Israel of the tax and customs revenues that would otherwise be due to the Palestinian Authority. The documents before the Committee demonstrate the importance of the programme, which was also recognised by the Court of Auditors. There is also a recognition that, as with a number of EC aid programmes, there have been problems in delivery. This is a matter on which there is agreement across the parties, and we are working hard to improve things. The support that is being given to the Palestinian Authority by the EC and the multilateral agencies, the work funded by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and our small bilateral programme are all designed to try to improve the capacity of the Palestinian Authority and to improve its structure so that it can spend support money effectively, while recognising that its circumstances could not be more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend seen yesterday's 	<i>Financial Times</i> article about EU aid and what has happened to it? I should like to alert him to three short extracts from it. The article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Israeli army has inflicted at least 20 million euros—£12.3 million—of damage on projects financed by the European Union in the Palestinian-controlled areas, according to statistics collated by member states and the Commission."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that that involved
	<br><blockquote><p>"destruction of parts of Gaza International airport and the bulldozing of greenhouses … shelling schools and wrecking irrigation systems,"</p></blockquote>
and states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"EU officials will today decide what measures, if any, they will recommend foreign ministers take when they meet next Monday in Brussels. So far, apart from unofficial complaints to the Israeli foreign ministry, there is no consensus, let alone any real push by member states to demand that Israel pay compensation over what amount to projects paid for by the European taxpayer."</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend comment on that report, on the damage that has been done and on what we are doing, collectively and individually, about the fact that good projects, funded by money given for good reasons, are being destroyed by military action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Europe (Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised the matter, which is of concern to the whole Committee. I understand from reports, not least in this morning's papers, that some £11 million worth of European funded property in Palestine has been destroyed, including a school building, an airport, a seaport, broadcasting studios and an irrigation scheme. I cannot but agree with the European Commissioner, Chris Patten, who is reported as having said that he was "shocked and astounded" at what was happening, and added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We ask whether it really contributes to security if everything we try to support with EU assistance is destroyed."</p></blockquote>
We share that concern expressed by the European Commissioner. We are very worried. There is no way in which the obliteration of much needed infrastructure of that kind, provided with taxpayers' money from Britain and other European states, could contribute to additional security and stability in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the situation is so fraught that yesterday a gunman opened fire in central Jerusalem's main shopping area, wounding more than 20 people. Six Israelis were killed in the banqueting hall attack during a bar mitzvah last week. Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior political member of Hamas, has issued this warning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have entered a new phase that will reach every Israeli everywhere."</p></blockquote>
Tit-for-tat violence is running away with itself, so while we join the European Union in condemning the destruction of European Union-funded infrastructure, we must also work hard, recognising that the terrorist attacks on Israelis are creating panic and producing the over-response. That response is perhaps understandable. What would happen if a gunman went loose in Oxford street? There would be calls for revenge, whether justified or not. We must work to re-establish peace in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mine is a simple procedural question. Not for the first time recently, there has been a long delay between the reference from the Select Committee and the meeting of this Committee to discuss matters. Delay is understandable in the present instance, but can my right hon. Friend expand a little on the reasons? The matter was referred in July and some of the documents date from a year or even two years ago. We should scrutinise such matters more quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's concern; perhaps it would help him and the rest of the Committee if I set out the chronology. The debate was originally requested before the general election. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was happy for it to take place. However, as scrutiny clearance was not required—the document was an information only document—we were content for the debate to happen in due course, when it was mutually convenient. As you will be aware, Mr. Amess, the Scrutiny Committee linked together two documents, one from DFID and one from the FCO. Today was the only day on which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development and I could find time, at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the convenience of the Committee, to attend the debate. Otherwise it would have been put off until late February. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) that there was no evil intent. It was just one of those things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rutland and Melton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister enlighten the Committee about the state of the infrastructure for the reliable supply of water to the Palestinian National Authority? Are there any projects in which the process that we are considering might be used to improve things? To what extent is the PNA dependent on third parties for its water supply, putting it at the mercy of any action by them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has rightly drawn attention to a matter of concern. We are working on the issue through the United Kingdom bilateral programme, which will this year total £14 million in the West Bank and Gaza—an increase on last year's figure of £8 million. We are also offering increased support to UNRWA, which will total £25 million this year. That includes work on water supply, including a particularly important project on which we are co-operating with the Palestinian authority in Hebron.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the reply that my hon. Friend the Minister gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. It is one of the frustrations of work on this Committee that we sometimes find that we are scrutinising historical documents. However, that is better than the alternative, when we occasionally find that we are to scrutinise documents that have not yet been written, or that exist only in a French version in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the document is a year old, will my hon. Friend comment on whether improvements have been undertaken in the past year to the European Union's management of its foreign aid budget, which might go some way towards tackling the questions raised in the documents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to speak about the process of the reform that the European Union has undertaken. For reasons that I outlined a moment ago, considerable and understandable concern has been expressed, and is reflected in the documents, about ineffective operations in the past. There is especial concern about the programme in Gaza and the West Bank, where there is an increasing disparity between the commitments and the actual expenditure, which has grown increasingly large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been structural reform, with Relex taking responsibility for the overall strategy for aid, and EuropeAid, which was set up last year, the responsibility for managing the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the backlog, a concerted effort has been made to reconsider commitments that, more than five years after their instigation, have not been spent, and to write them off the books. That backlog was cut by 51 per cent. last year. Discussion is taking place about a possible new financial regulation that would introduce a sunset clause, as the jargon has it, which would bring that five-year wiping-off timetable down to two or
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
three years. That would create a pressure to ensure that money that is committed is spent without inordinate delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a reduction in the number of contract types: there used to be 30 different contracts, and now there are four. A streamlined system has been created to deal with the process of tendering for aid. ECHO, the EC's emergency response organisation, has been restructured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is a process that the EC describes as "deconcentration", although I would prefer to use the word "delegation". Our experience in DFID has been that one can increase the effectiveness of an aid operation by having those responsible for administering the programme on the ground in the country in question. In relation to the EC office in Jerusalem, it has been agreed in principle that deconcentration and the process of increasing the number of staff should take place this year. That will lead to a significant increase in the number of staff on the ground who have responsibility for overseeing the programmes and providing technical support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, I should add that it remains to be seen how effective the new arrangements are in overcoming difficulties of which all members of the Committee are aware. We shall continue to monitor carefully, as it is in everyone's interest that we spend as effectively as possible the substantial sums of money that the EC makes available for aid generally, and especially in relation to Gaza and the West Bank. We must make sure that that money is spent in the interests of the people who really need that support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My party and I are committed to support for the Palestinian Authority, and we recognise the effect of the intifada and the unwarranted actions of the Israeli state. As a new member of the Committee, I have considered the documents and I have read about the sorry tale of under-management or non-existent management of some projects. The staff resource on one project fell from six to one. Given the Minister's last answer, how confident is he that that is in the past, and that projects will be managed better in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said a moment ago in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde, our view is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. Recognition has been made that the weaknesses, to which the hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention, need to be addressed. The right structures are being created but, as is often the case with a reform process, much depends on how effectively it is implemented and to what extent the arrangements that are put in place are carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Success depends especially on the quality of staff on the ground—a point that we have discussed with the Commission. Someone whose job in Brussels was to process paper—such jobs need to be done, and I mean no disrespect—will find that the responsibility for managing a programme is a different challenge. The Commission has recognised the need to ensure that staff with the right skills and attributes are put into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
such positions, especially in the delegated offices, because that is the best way of ensuring that there is the capacity to manage projects effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too want to talk about staffing. I fully accept what the Minister said about management being a multi-faceted problem, involving processes, skills and many other factors. Will he, however, comment on the issue of staff numbers? Paragraph 4.11 on page xxiii of the Scrutiny Committee's seventh report, which refers to paragraph 31 of the Court of Auditors report, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The report records that in 1994 the Representative to the Occupied Territories, who had been based in Brussels, moved to Jerusalem. As the Israeli authorities were not prepared to allow the Commission Representative to open and operate an office in that capacity, the European Commission Technical Assistance Office—ECTAO—was set up to manage the aid programme. Its activities were taken over in 1998 by the EC Representative Office—ECRO. It took the Commission five months to appoint a new Representative in 2000, leaving one official to manage all the activities."</p></blockquote>
Is my hon. Friend aware of any other situation in which an administrative authority, let alone an occupying authority, says to the EU, "It's up to us to determine how many people you send over here and what you will be allowed to do to operate your projects." Is that attitude not problematic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. He rightly draws attention to the particular difficulties with the Commission's representative office in Jerusalem. It might be helpful if I tell him, in addition to what I have already said, that delegation/deconcentration is due to start this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reinforcing the number of staff was dependent upon the negotiations. Those were concluded in June 2001 and clearance was given by the Israeli authorities to increase the staff in the current year. It was agreed that the office could employ up to nine more expatriate staff, consisting of two additional officials for contract and financial management and seven sector experts replacing the current MEDA technical assistance team. That would increase the total number of European expatriate staff in the office to 17, to be assisted by a more than equal number of local staff. The total number of staff in the office would then exceed 35. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that when implemented, that will represent a considerable increase in the available resources.

In addition, in 2001 the staff of the Commission's Jerusalem office was reinforced by what is known as a detached national expert—the term does not reflect on the nature of the postholder's application to their task—from the United Kingdom, and an additional technical assistant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of what the Under-Secretary said about the concerns that have been shared across the parties about EU aid in general, and in particular its delivery, will he tell the Committee whether, in relation to the Palestinians, the same problem has occurred that we have observed in other areas of EU aid? The main problem has been that large
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
numbers of charities and non-governmental organisations have had to borrow money at commercial rates because of the huge delays in the delivery of EU aid that has already been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development have been asked questions by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) and myself. The Secretary of State gave me a written answer on Monday, in which she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we understand that the delays have been reduced but remain of concern".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 January 2002; c. 603W, Vol. 378]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that under some EU aid programmes, millions of pounds due to charities and NGOs were not paid? Will he tell the Committee what he and his Department are doing to ensure that charities and NGOs are not left out of pocket? Clearly, it is a matter of huge concern, not only to all parties in the House, but to donors to charities in the UK. Those donors may find that the charities that they support have to waste their funds on borrowing at commercial rates because EU aid that has already been pledged has not been handed over for months, because of the EU's byzantine bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. He will have seen from my right hon. Friend's answer to the written question earlier this week that we recognise the problem, that some progress has been made but that there is continuing concern. I would be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with further details of the representations that we are making, and our current assessment of the scale of the problem, to which he rightly draws attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Roger Casale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe is right to emphasise the paramount need to safeguard the lives of Israeli citizens in the face of the dreadful suicide bomb attacks. Does he not agree, however, that Israel's long-term security will be severely compromised unless we can break the current spiral of violence, and that, by its own actions, Israel can contribute to a de-escalation of the conflict? Does he further agree that although the European Union has played an important economic role in the middle east, it has lacked the political clout strongly to influence the crisis there? Given Britain's standing and the Prime Minister's authority in the world today, does my right hon. Friend agree that the EU might now have more political leverage, and that it should try to advance the agenda in the middle east and move away from the counsel of despair that we seem now be facing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes his point well, and I agree with him. He was a little unfair about the EU's role, because Javier Solana, the Special Representative, has been actively promoting the middle east peace process and has travelled regularly to and fro in the region. The Belgian presidency and Commissioner Patten made an influential visit in the aftermath of 11 September, seeking to use that window of opportunity to bring people together. Sadly, it was not successful—but this is heavy lifting, and we must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
keep at it. Yes, the EU has a decisive role, and Britain, within the European Union, has a special part in that because we are trusted by both sides as virtually no other country is trusted. We can make a contribution, and we seek to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of my hon. Friend's earlier comment, I offer this observation. It is vital that we get the Palestinian Authority and Yasser Arafat, its leader, around the negotiating table with the Israeli Government and Prime Minister Sharon. I do not understand their strategy. I do not understand where Prime Minister Sharon believes he is taking his country when he responds as he does—perhaps understandably—to the awful terrorist attacks made by suicide bombers and others in the midst of Israeli communities. Those attacks cause terror and mayhem and constant daily fear, and I can understand the response, but I do not see how Israel's security can be advanced by that sort of strategy. It is imperative that both sides call a halt to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return briefly to the matter of late payment and the costs faced by charities that have to borrow to pay their bills as a result? It was the Government's policy for the private sector that companies that paid late should reimburse the extra interest charged to those who were waiting to be paid. Will he assure the Committee that in the charitable sector, it is the Government's policy on such projects that if a charity is out of pocket because of a late payment, it will be reimbursed the costs that it has unreasonably had to pay as a result of late payment by the likes of the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point, and I appreciate the analogy that the hon. Gentleman draws between that and the problems faced by business more generally. However, I cannot give him an undertaking that it is the EC's intention to operate such a policy in relation to late payments. It would not be proper for me to do so. Expectation about payment would depend on the detail of the arrangements. As I said to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), the most practical contribution that we can make is to put pressure on to ensure that difficulties with late payments are overcome so that the money can be passed on directly. I am glad to say that, so far as I am aware, that difficulty does not relate to our bilateral programme to support the capacity of the Palestinian Authority in several areas in Gaza and the West Bank.

	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend a specific question? A project mentioned in the documents that gives cause for concern, in terms of its cost and various levels of mismanagement, is the European Gaza hospital. The Scrutiny Committee regretted the fact
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that it had not been updated about what was happening on the project a year ago. I am willing to accept a written reply, but will my hon. Friend update us on whether the hospital exists? Is it open? Does it treat people? Has it been knocked down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I go back to the question of deconcentration? Will the Under-Secretary comment on how problems may be solved by the recruitment of local staff, rather than moving out staff who have previously been flying desks?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point about the balance of skills available in delegated offices. Increasingly, the Department for International Development recruits further staff locally, which in itself makes an important contribution to the development of countries in which we work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question gives me the opportunity to mention the importance of the changes to the Commission's staff regulations. In discussions with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and me, Commissioner Nielson and his colleagues have said that their capacity to ensure that people with the right skills are moved to the delegated offices would be improved by broad changes in the staff regulations. Those are yet to be completed, but once they have been, they will give the Commission a greater opportunity to ensure that it can put the right people in the right jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe if he is aware of the letter that has been faxed to all member states of the European Union from an organisation called LAW, or the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment? It is about the application of the EU-Israel association agreement, and recognises that the EU has attached great importance to Israel's legitimate security concerns. It also draws member states' attention to the fact that the association agreement is meant to be seen in the context of the Euro-Med agreement, which includes respect for human rights within the framework of the rule of law in accordance with article 2 of that agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on to ask, in view of the concern expressed by the association council on 20 November about extra-judicial killings, administrative detention, collective punishment and the increasing recourse to house demolitions, what the EU will do about that, beyond expressing concern. Will it respond positively to the calls from many quarters—but particularly from

the Palestinians—to put international monitors on the ground to give us a clear picture of what is going on and, I hope, to help do something about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for courteously giving me a copy of that submission before the debate, and it makes a powerful case. The European Union is indeed concerned about the deterioration in the situation. We shall continue to raise the denial of human rights and the escalation of violence by both sides through our process of engagement with the Israeli Government and through the association council. We monitor the situation continuously and will carry on doing so. It will remain a matter of concern as long as both parties behave as they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain supports the principle of external monitors, who could make both sides aware that they had inserted themselves into the situation and could contribute not only to observation, but to restraint. We continue to press the issue, and I hope that the Israeli Government will agree that having such observers would be in their best interests. Equally, it would be in the interests of the Israeli people, who are confronted with suicide bombings and gunmen rampaging through their streets, for objective international observers to ensure that the peace process went forward, rather going than continuously backwards, as, sadly, it has done these past few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Barrett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the possibility of co-ordinating with other organisations the monitoring of the large sums that go into this complex area? Other groups and organisations must have problems similar to those of the Government, and there may be scope to work with others in the region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Several existing forums aim to co-ordinate the international aid effort for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including the formal ad hoc liaison committee, which meets regularly. Member states are also represented by the EC. Furthermore, informal donor meetings take place in Brussels—the last one was just before Christmas—and in Jerusalem, and the World Bank and the IMF usually attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to an important point. We and the rest of the EC have pushed for a more harmonised, pooled approach, under which donors would move away from their bilateral activities towards—I hate to use the jargon— a more joined-up attitude. That approach can help to overcome the difficulties of the Palestinian Authority, whose capacity to cope with the challenges that it faces—not least the intifada—is greatly stretched. It is a step forward to be able to deal with one organisation in which several multilateral bodies and individual bilateral donors have pooled their money. That is an issue in several developing countries, and we are pushing in that direction because we can see the benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If no more hon. Members have questions, we shall proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.9 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has already heard quite enough from me, so I shall not make a speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 11381/00, the mmission Communication on "Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process", and 14778/00, relating to the Special Report by the Court of Auditors on the management by the Commission of the programme of assistance to Palestinian Society; and welcomes the Government's approach to EC assistance to Palestinian society and supports the Government's continuing commitment to the Barcelona Process.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by unreservedly condemning the attacks that took place in Jerusalem, and I am sure that all Committee members will want to join me. We welcome the Barcelona process, more formally known as the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and look upon it as a valuable part of the relations of European Union member states with the other Mediterranean states. It has helped to create and improve dialogue and it has the potential to contribute much needed economic development to areas, especially in the middle east, where such assistance could bring real benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of the reports and communications before us is serious. Large sums of money and the economic future of many Palestinians are at stake. The Palestinian Authority is in desperate need of economic progress and of the stability that that will bring. If we are to see the viable Palestinian state that is required for long-term peace, the question of economic development in the Palestinian areas must be addressed. We must work to ensure that the infrastructure, power supplies, water supplies and transport links, all of which I referred to in a debate in Westminster Hall on 15 January, are in place to support a tolerable standard of living and properly functioning civic facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside that basic infrastructure, a functioning education and health care system must be established and maintained. All those are vital, and effective aid will help to increase trust and reduce the economically based resentment that is the enemy of progress. We have the opportunity through these programmes, if they are well implemented, to help to build hope among the Palestinians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is our duty to raise some serious issues in the context of aid, not just as trustees of public funds, but as people concerned with peace and progress in the middle east. The original reports contain worrying references to mismanagement of aid money by the Palestinian Authority, apparent mismanagement of large sums and a lack of transparency and clarity in the way in which those funds are spent. We must be sure where the money goes and what it is spent on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody objects to aid that helps to create a more viable peace process, and the EU aid referred to in these documents has the potential to do just that. However, the safeguards and assurances must be in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
place to guarantee that the money cannot find its way into the hands of terrorists or be spent on arms used to murder innocent Israeli civilians on the street. We do not want to find that this aid has funded arms shipments rather than a viable Palestinian state. It must get to the people who really need it to improve their lives, and it must be spent on basic energy, transport and other infrastructure projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect, which may appear to some tangential but is relevant to EU aid to Palestine and illustrative of the need for transparency, is the question of school textbooks. School is where opinion starts, and textbooks shape the minds of millions of youngsters. We must know what steps are being taken to ensure that their content is pro-peace process, and that no polarising or racist language is used in the books that might shape the outlook of future generations for the worse. We must be sure that any way in which EU aid could conceivably be spent is monitored to ensure that it serves its intended purpose. I know that the issue of the educational content of aid is of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, and also to my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About one third of DFID's aid budget is spent by EU-managed programmes. It must be a priority for the EU and for our Government to address any shortcomings in the management of aid programmes that use such large amounts of public money. They have massive potential to do good, but can also do evil or simply be wasted if the proper safeguards are not in place and carefully monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In parallel, the Palestinian Authority must address its shortcomings and manage the aid granted to it with the clarity and honesty demanded by the public. Only if we make sure that the aid is properly targeted can we be sure that it will help to build the infrastructure and the basic services needed to create a viable stable state. Only then shall we see a state that is willing and able to engage fully in the peace process and engage the Israeli Government in constructive dialogue. Only then will there be genuine progress in the peace process. That is by no means the only element required for long-term peace, but it has an important role to play, and I hope that the Committee's deliberations today will contribute to ensuring that it happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.14am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly, because unlike some of my hon. Friends, I am not an expert on middle east affairs. None the less, I should like to put my views to the two Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome all that the European Union can do to help Palestinian society. It is desperate; people are suffering terribly in Palestine—and some of that is a result of the actions of terrorists from Palestine. The world needs to focus on what is happening there. It is not surprising that funds are sometimes mismanaged in a place that at times barely functions as a coherent state. Even in the best regulated states, like those of the European Union, funds are not always perfectly managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
We must deal with the political problem of the middle east, and not study the details of aid. It is significant that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe is here as well as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, because the problem is clearly political, and not just a technical aid problem. Clearly the Israelis must be pressed more strongly to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state with agreed boundaries—boundaries agreed by the Palestinians, not just imposed by one side. That will be a difficult process. Moving from the Oslo accords to where we are now has been a depressing decline, and talking about aid without dealing with the major political problems is like watching a ship listing heavily and slowly sinking, while discussing financial arrangements with the purser's office. That may sound like a trivial way to look at things, but we must do something about the fact that the ship is in peril. Major steps need to be taken internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to recognise that both states—Israel and Palestine—are not political monoliths. There are peace movements within both of them, and secular democrats who want a proper modern state and do not want to give in to the extremes of religious nationalism that have taken hold in recent years. We should remember that right-wing Governments in Israel often win elections only by small majorities, against a substantial body of opinion in which there is concern about the direction taken by the Israeli Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Palestinian side, encouraging political developments have taken place in past years. Perhaps they have been overwhelmed recently by the rise in religious nationalism, but it is the despair of the Palestinian people that has given strength to the religious nationalists, extremists and terrorists. There are and have been many democratic politicians on the Palestinian side. Throughout the Arab world a high proportion of university academics are Palestinian. They have a tremendous amount to offer the world once their state is established and they can begin to live a normal life of one that is dominated and fragmented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have real optimism about the future of Palestine once we can establish a viable state. I also think—this has been said before—that the security of Israel depends on accepting a Palestinian state on agreed terms. Once that happens, Israel will have a secure future and the extremism that is now apparent in the Government of Israel will diminish. Democrats and peace lovers will emerge, and the same will happen on the other side. We must put more effort into working for that. The tragic events of the past six months have, I think, stirred the west to take the situation more seriously, instead of acquiescing in what happens without doing much. Pressure must be exerted on Israel, in addition to adopting measures to stop terrorism against Israel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am describing a simple approach, but we must not be too obsessed with the details of aid when a major political problem needs to be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.20 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I compliment, and agree with, those who spoke from both Front Benches; they talked about our outrage at the violence of the past 24 hours, which comes on top of the violence of the past few months. We must be careful to condemn all the violence that has taken place over the past few days, including the appalling attack in Jerusalem yesterday. Like everyone else, I experience a chill at the thought that Israeli friends of mine who live in west Jerusalem could have been part of that bus queue. Fortunately they were not, but the thought sends a chill through me none the less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, a chill goes through me when I think of what might happen to friends in Nablus when Israeli tanks roll on to their streets. Just before yesterday's attack, four people were killed in a house in Nablus. We are told by Israel that they were Hamas activists and terrorists—I have no idea about that. Apparently the incident was part of a fire-fight and that one man was shot in the shower, which seems an odd place from which to defend a house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the violence in recent months has been appalling. We should also record another act of violence, in which a Palestinian was shot by Palestinian Authority personnel. After the news of the killings in Nablus by Israeli forces, a major demonstration occurred outside the Nablus prison, which is run by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians, outraged by what had happened, demanded the release of
	<br><blockquote><p>"25 Hamas members interned as part of Mr. Arafat's efforts to maintain a ceasefire. Police dispersed the protesters with teargas, stun grenades and live ammunition. A Palestinian man, Abdel Nasser Swaftah, 37, later died from head injuries."</p></blockquote>
That is appalling for the man who died, and for the Palestinians in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember that Israel's justification for its incursions into Palestinian territories is that, allegedly, neither the Palestinian Authority collectively nor Yasser Arafat in particular has taken any action against Hamas or other terrorists. In that case, why are Palestinians demonstrating against the Palestinian Authority in Nablus, demanding the release of people who, according to the Israelis, are not in jail? That demonstration ended with one person dying at the hands, not of the Israelis, but of Palestinian forces. It is important to set that in the context of Israel's claims about the so-called justification for its actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report from the Court of Auditors is hard-hitting and critical about the management of projects—rightly so in many ways, as both my hon. Friends who have spoken on the subject have said. The responsibility for that is divided several ways. It is partly due to the administrative capabilities—or lack of them—of the Palestinian Authority. It is also party due to procedures in the European Commission and the European Union, and the monitoring undertaken by those bodies. Partly, however, as my hon. Friends have acknowledged, it also the result of Israel's response to the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The report rightly emphasises the effect of the closures that have blocked the transfer of money and tax revenues that are vital to the Palestinian economy. The report comments critically on other aspects, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) raised the issue of Palestinian text books, which is a subject worth addressing. A lot of things have been said about racism in the Palestinian curriculum. The issue of aid for education is an important part of the European Union's programme. A recent study of the Palestinian curriculum was made by Nathan Brown, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington university. I shall briefly refer to that study, as it is important to know what is used in Palestinian schools and what is not—and why it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Brown said that his research focused
	<br><blockquote><p>"primarily on the role of democracy in the new curriculum. Nevertheless, I could not ignore the international controversy surrounding Palestinian textbooks and the many claims that they incite violence and racial hatred. I was therefore surprised to find books that were far less incendiary than portrayed; most were perfectly innocuous."</p></blockquote>
He continued by describing the background, in these terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Upon assuming responsibility over Palestinian education in 1994, the Palestinian Authority (PA) restored the Jordanian and Egyptian curriculum in their entirety as an interim measure. This included the use of books that contained sharply anti-Israeli and even anti-Semitic material. It is based on these books that the strongest charges have been levied. Criticisms of that decision are fair, but must be viewed in conjunction with the following facts:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The PA determined from the beginning to replace these books and formed a curriculum development center to draft a new set of books. This decision came not as a response to international pressure but instead was a Palestinian initiative (though some international funding was available)."—</p></blockquote>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is aware of that funding. The research document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The plan developed by that center has proceeded according to schedule.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The PA issued a series of 	<i>National Education</i> books for grades 1–6 to supplement the Egyptian and Jordanian books while the new books were being written. Those books were devoid of any anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli material.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Oddly, Israel allowed the offensive Jordanian books to be used in the East Jerusalem schools but barred the innocuous PA-authored books, probably fearful that use of the PA books would be an implicit recognition of sovereignty."</p></blockquote>
That quote may cast a slightly different angle on the debate over Palestinian textbooks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited the occupied territories at the end of October, as part of the Barcelona process, for a seminar organised by the Palestinian Legislative Council—the PLC—in conjunction with the European Commission. That visit made clear to me how many good projects funded by the EC are being interrupted. I saw schools that were on a shift system, because there was not enough money to allow children to go to school all day every day. More than 50 per cent. of Palestinians living in Gaza do so on less than $2 a day, which is the official poverty threshold. The report in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> to which I referred during the question session mentioned the damage that is being done to projects by military action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
We should be aware of those matters and, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, of the need to improve the effectiveness of EU aid and how it is managed—but I caution against throwing out the baby with the bathwater. I worry about the parts of the documents that say that we should reduce involvement to more manageable proportions. That may be right, but the EC presence and the aid that is given is in itself an important statement. It was so important to people in Gaza that politicians such as myself, and those from other European countries, were there, because our being there was a way of saying, "We know you're here and that you're trying to establish institutions, and we are with you"—I do not mean "with you" in a political sense, but being there to bear witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's presence is valued, which is why the issue of international monitors is so important. Some European politicians are already involved in such activities; in the past few weeks, Luisa Morgantini and Ulla Sandbaek, who are Italian and Danish MEPs, have both been in the country to monitor. In fact, Luisa Morgantini was thrown to the ground when Dr. Barghouthi, a Palestinian human rights activist, was arrested by Israeli forces a few weeks ago. We must retain a presence and value the good work that the European Commission does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my visit, I thought that it was ironic that I, as a British politician, could travel to a seminar sponsored by the European Commission in Gaza city and meet Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, but those same Legislative Council members were not allowed to travel from Gaza to their offices in Ramallah, in another part of the Palestinian territory. I met the Palestinian Minister for the Environment, who is a great environmentalist, and is concerned about the degradation of the environment in Gaza, and Israel's dumping of toxic waste in that area. Yet ironically, although I can travel half way round the world to talk to him, he cannot travel a few miles up the road to do his job. That is the effect of closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those factors are important in the context of the EU-Israel association agreement. Indeed, the agreement seeks respect for human rights and for the rule of law at a time when we see less and less of that. For instance, we know that damage is being done to projects and that extra-judicial killings are going on. I am pleased to hear that Britain favours the use of international observers, but eyes are now turning to the European Union. If those words about respect for human rights are to mean anything, they must be backed by action. Instruments are available for taking action under the association agreements. There is a debate taking place on Zimbabwe in Westminster Hall today, and we know that the EU will discuss Zimbabwe on 28 January, both with the emphasis not on what we say about it, but on what we will do. I hope that at the next EU-Israel association council, the focus will also shift to what we are to do about the situation in Israel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One part of the association agreement is particularly important, and that is the fact that it includes trade provisions that allow Israel preferential terms for imports of Israeli goods into the EU. However, it does

not allow preferential terms for goods to come in to the EU that are not Israeli but, according to international law, are made illegally on settlements in the West Bank in Gaza and imported into the EU under preference with the label "Made in Israel". Yet that is known to happen, and in answer to questions to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, it has been acknowledged that the British Government and the EU have grave suspicions that it is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Israel was questioned about the matter, but it did not give satisfactory answers, and the position will be reviewed at the next association council meeting. Reviewing things is all well and good, but I must ask my right hon. Friend what will happen as a result. If we continue to allow the association agreement to be abused and its provisions to be broken, and if the EU agrees to ignore it—other than issuing a few words of warning—we shall have undermined the agreement and other future agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North that if we do that, we will be doing nothing to further real peace in the middle east. We will appear to be fudging it. We will seem to be saying that there is one law for Israel and another for Palestinians, and I cannot imagine anything more likely to increase the frustration and sense of despair among Palestinians. Moreover, although Israel has every right unconditionally to demand recognition, and security and peace for its people, we are not saying, as we should, that Israel does not have the right to put conditions on everybody else's rights and make those rights dependent upon Israel's discretion and say-so. That is what the Sharon Government are doing, and it is wrong. It is time for the European Union to be more assertive, and for us to say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that three major themes emerge from the documents, but I shall put them in an order slightly different from that chosen by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden). First, there are the lessons for the European Union about the management of its external aid programmes, particularly in difficult regions. It is inevitable that aid is often given as a result of natural disaster or on-going war. We are not likely to give aid to an area that is beautiful, well governed and well run, and where all lines of communications are open. We are debating an extreme example, but it is important that lessons are learned from the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to focus on that subject, and as this is a European scrutiny Committee, I assumed that that would be the majority topic of discussion. However, you have been extremely generous in allowing the debate to range much wider than the Committee's remit would normally allow, Mr. Amess—even Zimbabwe has been mentioned. A precedent has been set, and I am happy to follow suit and address some of my remarks to the general political context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lessons for the EU. My hon. Friend may correct me on this, but I believe that Boutros Boutros-Ghali's first step on becoming UN Secretary-General was to establish the "lessons learned unit", whose sole
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
task within the UN edifice was to collate the lessons learned from various UN initiatives and exercises and diffuse them through the rest of the organisation. I do not know whether the EU has such a unit, but will my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe tell us whether the EU is permeated by a "lessons learned" mentality? Is there a genuine willingness to find out where measures have gone wrong and, as the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) suggested, to consider Christian Aid programmes in the region, and best practice? Are such steps being taken?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the suggestion that was made both by my right hon. Friend and by the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman—that Britain is one of the foremost countries in the EU in arguing for the more rigorous application of the relevant rules, and for lessons to be learned. I also welcome his suggestion that progress has been made since the period to which the documents relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a few words about the general context. Hon. Members have said that we should bear in mind the fact that there is fault on both sides, but I hope that they will forgive me for saying that they then went on to major heavily on the faults of just one side. I do not want to gainsay the idea that there are faults on both sides, but I shall consider the other side of the equation for a moment. I have no brief for Ariel Sharon or his Government; indeed, I was much happier when there were Labour Administrations, because genuine progress was made with the peace process then. I am therefore no fan of Mr. Sharon or his modus operandi.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, critical that we ask why Israeli citizens support Ariel Sharon, when only a couple of years ago they were willing to take historic steps and make historic compromises for peace, and to embrace the Oslo accords, the Wye River agreement and what, by any stretch of the imagination, were historic compromises at Camp David in the dying days of the Clinton Administration. They support him not because they do not want peace or because they have suddenly become bad people, but because they are terrified that their very existence—this is not simply a matter of their security as they go about their business—is under threat every day. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe mentioned that terror and fear in an earlier reply, and we would do well to bear it in mind. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North that the majority of Israeli citizens would much rather be in a different situation and embrace a peaceful solution. If they have rejected such a solution, it is not out of badness or malice, but out of terror. We should bear that in mind when we consider where responsibility for the situation lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield was right to establish the broader context, but I want to consider some specific points. It is not Israel's fault that there was mismanagement and incompetence as regards the European Gaza hospital or the Palestinian Housing Council, or that there was incompetence and corruption over the location of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Those projects are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority. My hon. Friend asked whether there was a lack of capability on the part of the authority, but then shrugged his shoulders and moved on. However, the authority administers European taxpayers' money, and we must examine its capability before we give it any more. I do not say that we should close off aid, but as part of our on-going commitment, we must analyse the authority's ability to manage projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.20 of the seventh report of the Scrutiny Committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The decision by the Commission to provide assistance to the Palestine Housing Council … is described by the Court as an ambitious step for which the Commission deserves credit. It then points out deficiencies in the management of the project, both by the PHC and the Commission. At one point they were not on speaking terms."</p></blockquote>
That reads more like a description of an Edwardian marriage than of a contractual agreement and a relationship between a funding body and an organisation in receipt of its funds. How on earth did the European Commission, which provided funds, allowed itself to be frozen out and not spoken to by the Palestinian Housing Council, which administered the funds, ostensibly to provide housing for its own people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the saga of the European Gaza hospital. I am delighted that the hospital is now open, 10 years after its inception. An audit of that process might give ample opportunity for a full debate on that subject alone. We should also remember the Palestinian Legislative Council. It agreed with the Commission to fund the construction of its building in Ramallah, only for the Commission to discover much later that it had entered into a second agreement to construct another building elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the report, those funds have now been "decommitted"—but how much of that money was spent on finding a site, planning the architecture and carrying out site surveys? Such matters are not cheap, especially when we are talking about something akin to a Government. When the funds were committed, did the Palestinian Authority know that there were already plans to build something elsewhere? If so, that is serious. None of that mismanagement, incompetence and corruption can be laid at the feet of Israel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report repeatedly refers to a period when there was a much greater sense of harmony in the region, without the interfada or the current unrest. Instead, there was great hope and optimism when there was a Labour Government, and a much greater sense of dialogue between the parties. However, there was still mismanagement of funds and incompetence. Again, it cannot be said that the fault lies with the daily intransigence of the Sharon Government. Many of the problems detailed in the documents refer to a time before Sharon, when relations between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority were better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield that if we are to continue with the process, we have to be tough on Israel. However, we also have to be tough on the Palestinian Authority.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
We must ensure that money committed by the United Kingdom and the European Union is spent on the projects for which it is earmarked, and that there is no incompetence or corruption. In this country, even if we pay builders and they do not deliver the goods or provide value for money, we can be reasonably certain that our money is not being spent on arms or shipments of explosives. Are we certain that money given by the EU for certain projects, on which we know that it was not spent, has not been filtered away to continue the armed struggle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unhappy about the tone of what my hon. Friend says. Corruption has to be condemned wherever it is found, and one has to attach conditions to aid to ensure that it does not happen. However, I know for a fact that there is corruption in many other major established countries that receive aid from the EU and elsewhere. Is he saying that corruption in Palestine is worse than in those other countries? I suspect that it is rather better, judging by some earlier comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering a report from the Court of Auditors on the way in which those funds were handled in Palestine. That is the basis of my comment. I do not, therefore, feel qualified to comment until I have seen reports into the way in which EU funds are handled. My hon. Friend has been a member of this Committee for far longer than I have. He may, therefore, be able to tell me about other Court of Auditors reports into EU funding elsewhere. I am happy to accept the basic thrust of his argument that there is corruption elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such corruption should not be tolerated, whether it occurs in Palestine or anywhere else. It is important that the Palestinian Authority is properly funded and has its own council, a working parliament, hospitals and good houses. However, how sure are we that all the money given for such projects was actually spent on them and did not end up being spent, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton suggested, on the means of continuing an armed struggle, which was not the intention of the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that corruption needs to be rooted out wherever it exists, whether in the Palestinian Authority or anywhere else. I would like to take my hon. Friend back to one of his points. Because the reports mainly refer to the situation before the intifada started, Israeli policies of border closure and so on could not have had a big impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors report was published on 16 October 2000, less than a month after the start of the intifada. Paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 on page 12 of that report talk about the negative impact that Israeli policies, such as requiring permits to travel, were already having on Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip at that time and before. As tensions increased, Israel adopted the policy of sealing the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has had a considerable negative impact on the Palestinian economy by increasing unemployment, hindering trade, increasing costs and slowing down the implementation of development projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I hope that my hon. Friend will agree with me that, although things have got a lot worse under Sharon, such policies did not start under him. Many were being implemented when the rest of us were saying, "Isn't it wonderful that there's a peace process." At the same time, Palestinians were living in abject conditions. There may just be a link between our failure to recognise that and the start of the intifada.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily concede those points. They are not in dispute. I readily concede that Israel's behaviour has often exacerbated the situation, but I hope that my hon. Friend will concede that the behaviour of the Palestinian Authority has not been exemplary on every occasion. I am sure that he will concede that the Palestinian Authority does not have, or pretend to have, complete control over everything that goes on in its geographical area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, I welcome the fact that the Palestinian Authority is beginning to get a bit tougher on some of those operating unchecked—I will not use the phrase "under licence", because I do not like it— from bases in Palestine to launch terrorist attacks on Israel. I obviously regret the killing of one Palestinian by another, but if the Palestinian Authority sends a clear signal that it will not tolerate such breaches, some good may come out of that tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question for DFID and the EU is whether to increase resources in order to match high aspirations, or to lower aspirations and do less, but better. I am unashamedly in the second camp. It is always a mistake when there is mismanagement and funds are going missing to believe that the problem will be solved if more money is thrown at it. I do not agree; that is not the right attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must focus on getting core activities right and ensuring that, within waivers and limits, corruption is minimised. If we can get those basics right, the programme should be expanded, but if there is a running argument about whether to increase resources to manage existing programmes or to lower aspirations and do less, better, I will nail my colours to the latter mast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Roger Casale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this timely opportunity to debate the positive role that the European Union can play in relation to the present crisis in the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I preface my remarks by saying that I welcome the fact that a debate of this kind brings together hon. Members such as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield, who has had such a distinguished and long record of commitment to the middle east peace process, and others who have perhaps come to the subject more recently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all recognise that we need to set the question of the EU's role in the middle east, and, in particular, the EU's aid and assistance to the Palestinian Authority, in a broader strategic context. The middle east crisis is at the top of the international security agenda. All of us who want the forces of moderation and democracy to prevail over a descent into violence and despair should want to show our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
colours at the present time and engage in the debate, just as we look to the European Union to step up its engagement with the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and in response to a reply given by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe, I do recognise the roles that EU high representative Solana and External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten have played—not forgetting the EU special envoy for the middle east peace process, Mr. Moratinos. However, I think that all three would be the first to admit that their role would be more effective with clearer political leadership, stronger political will and a broader strategy—together with a mechanism for monitoring it—for using EU influence to try to stabilise the situation in the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drafting of the documents that are before us began in 2000, and there has since been a dreadful decline in the political situation in the middle east, with the breakdown of the peace process, the start of the second intifada and a steady deterioration with respect to security. As has been mentioned, Israeli tanks rolled into the Palestinian town of Nablus yesterday, and last night we learned of a further shooting, on the streets of Jerusalem, of Israeli citizens by a Palestinian suicide gunman. The ebb and flow of violence in the middle east has claimed more than 1,000 lives since November 2000–80 per cent. of them Palestinians, and many of them women and children. Yet the cycle of murderous attacks followed by brutal assassinations and savage military reprisals daily becomes more severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that dismal backdrop, we are right to ask what, if anything, can be done to move the Arab-Israeli conflict away from violence and towards the path of peace. This debate provides a further opportunity to reconsider what steps can be taken by Britain, the international community and, in particular, the European Union, to engage constructively in the current middle east crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years, the EU has provided substantial economic assistance and aid to the Palestinian Authority. More than 108 million ecus were given to the authority in 2001, in addition to the more than 3 billion ecus that have been invested in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1994. The EU has also done more than any other institution to promote elections, the fight against corruption and the rule of law in the Palestinian territories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the peace process broke down, the EU rightly began to examine its role and effectiveness more critically. Later, as the political and security crisis deepened, the EU's overall strategic framework for aid to the middle east began to be called into question. By the time of the terrorist attacks on America on 11 September, the EU's approach to the middle east was in need of a complete overhaul. We face the choice of finding a bold new impetus for EU involvement or losing influence in the region for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents that we are considering today relate to the Court of Auditors assessment of the assistance that has been given to the Palestinian authority, but also the strategic framework—the Barcelona
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
process—through which the EU has sought to bring the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority together, in the context of a regional initiative to secure peace and stability in the Mediterranean region. The European Union can play a greater role in relation to the middle east, but that will require much greater leadership, political will and, perhaps, an entirely new strategy to build on the Barcelona process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors report makes the understandable, if obvious, point that the effectiveness of the economic assistance provided to the Palestinian Authority has been hampered by deterioration in the political and security situation. It also criticises the lack of management skills, staff and co-ordination necessary for the efficient delivery of the programme. The building of the European Gaza hospital is cited as a particular example of such failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part, the difficulties encountered by the EU in delivering development assistance to the Palestinian Authority are germane to the EU's development work as a whole. However, given that such problems exist in relation to similar programmes elsewhere, it is not surprising that the situation has been further exacerbated in this case by the political situation in the middle east. That has made it harder to deliver individual projects on budget, on time and to the defined specifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also heard evidence that completed EU-funded projects have been damaged or destroyed by the fighting—particularly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield said, by Israeli military reprisals in the Palestinian-controlled areas. In re-examining the package of assistance, it is right to accept that there is always a need—as there is in this instance—to improve the efficiency and monitoring of EU projects in the area. However, I do not believe that it would be right in the present circumstances to use that kind of argument to throw the existence of the aid package into question. On the contrary, it is crucial that the EU should continue and, if possible, step up its assistance to the Palestinian Authority, not just as an instrument of development aid, but to help to shore up the Palestinian Authority and so help to stabilise the political situation in the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should recognise that there is a two-way relationship between aid and the political and security situation. As the Court of Auditors report makes clear, a deterioration of the security situation would hamper our development efforts. It is also the case that reducing the level of assistance would aggravate the political situation and lead to further escalations of conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU must continue to take the lead in supporting the Palestinian Authority, recognising that it is the only structure capable of providing basic services and a minimum security guarantee; it is the only alternative to anarchy and increasing support for militant groups, such as Hamas and jihad. We should ask our Ministers to work with their EU counterparts to impress on Israel the need for restraint—not least because in destroying infrastructure and public buildings in the West Bank and Gaza, and through its policy of closures, it is destroying projects that have been paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
for in whole or in part by Europeans, who will wish to hold them to account. We in Europe, and people across the world, have a stake in the success of those projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree strongly with my hon. Friend. Does he agree that a good case can be made for substantially increasing aid in order to rebuild the very projects that have been destroyed by military action by Israel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Roger Casale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do agree. I hope that the matter will be discussed at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Brussels next week and at subsequent summits of the Euro-Med council and the Barcelona summit. It is right that we should do that; there is a fundamental issue of human rights and of justice. It is also essential in order to stabilise the situation in the middle east. None of us should forget that the situation is so grave that we all—wherever we are in the world—have a stake in a satisfactory outcome to the present crisis in the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the Barcelona process itself. It was launched under the Spanish EU presidency in 1995. By coincidence, we are re-examining the Barcelona process under another Spanish presidency. It was also in Spain—in Madrid—that the Palestinians and Israelis were brought together under American leadership 10 years ago, when a strong, new impetus was given to the peace process that led to the Oslo accords and the Mitchell agreements. The process must be seen as an attempt by the EU to help create the conditions to shape the parameters of the middle east peace process so as to increase its chances of success. As the tragic events unfold in the middle east, it is clear not only that the peace process has broken down but that the road back to the peace process is no longer in sight. Under those circumstances, the question of reinvigorating the Barcelona process must, as today's debate suggests, be seen in a completely different context from that when the document was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider not only how best to reinvigorate the process but whether the strategic approach that underlies the Barcelona process is appropriate. Looking today at the Barcelona process, it seems to me that we need to consider three principal options. First, we might consider abandoning the process in the face of the current crisis, or at least formally decouple the Barcelona process from our strategy to put the middle east process back on track. We can see that from the minutes and from the ministerial correspondence in the documents before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the EuroMed meeting in November 2000, the middle east issue was dealt with in separate meetings, and at the Euro-Med meeting in November 2001, EU Foreign Ministers could do little more than reaffirm their commitment to the Barcelona declaration and urge both Palestinians and Israelis to end their violence and return to the negotiating table. However, it was clear that there was no prospect—it has been confirmed today—of the charter for peace and stability, which was meant to underpin the Barcelona process, being signed. Moreover, although the importance of widening and deepening dialogue
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
between cultures and civilisations within the European framework was emphasised, especially in relation to education, youth and the media, there was also recognition of the fact that that dialogue would have little or no impact on shaping the political and security situation in the middle east. However, to abandon the Barcelona process would be to advocate a counsel of despair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second option to consider is whether, if the Barcelona process can be reinvigorated, it could have a discernible impact on the current crisis. That seems to be the Government's preferred option, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply. It could be argued that there is sufficient flexibility in the Barcelona process to accommodate discussion of the middle east crisis while moving forward on other aspects of the European Mediterranean agenda, and that the stronger the bilateral links that bind EU countries to those non-EU countries that border the Mediterranean, the better the prospects for peace and stability in the region, whatever the outcome of the peace process in the middle east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that there would be much merit in reinvigorating the Barcelona process, and I hope that the Minister will take those arguments further when he meets his EU counterparts next week and at the Euro-Med conference in April. The process is well established, and it provides a vehicle and mechanism for taking forward and implementing important strands of an overall approach to the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third option that I ask the Committee to consider is that the Barcelona process should be set within a new strategic framework if we are to give a new impetus to the EU's role and influence in the middle east. We should take the process forward, but recognise also that the strategy underpinning that process has been overtaken by events. It is time now to broaden that strategy and to give it a new strategic focus. We face a middle east crisis, not a middle east peace process. That crisis must be seen as an international security crisis of the highest order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot continue to view the political situation in the middle east—as the Barcelona process does—as being predominantly about regional peace and stability in the Mediterranean area. I submit that the Barcelona process should continue to be part of our overall approach within the new strategic framework, but that the impetus for recasting and reinvigorating the framework must come from elsewhere in the EU's institutional portfolio. In particular, we should examine the role that the instruments of the European Union's common foreign and security policy can bring to bear. Such is the elaboration of common positions in relation to the middle east, that I would favour the elaboration by the EU of a common strategy on the middle east, with a much stronger input from the European Council at the level of heads of state, leading into the Barcelona summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traditionally, as I commented in my earlier intervention on my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the EU has been seen as—and has been—economically powerful, but has not enjoyed political power or influence commensurate with its economic strength.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
That has been particularly true in the middle east. That is a serious handicap in relation to the role that the EU can play with respect to the unfolding crisis. However, new leadership—by Britain in particular—would help to overcome the EU's lack of political authority internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that will not be lost on any Committee member is the extent to which many citizens not just in this country but across the European Union look to our Prime Minister as the European leader who could move the political and security agenda in the middle east forward from its present position towards the path of peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that today's debate will encourage the Government to try to move the EU agenda beyond simply attempting to reinvigorate the Barcelona process. Instead we should recognise that Britain can play a decisive role in giving new impetus to the overall EU approach to the middle east, by focusing attention on the middle east crisis as an issue that threatens international security. It is in Britain's interest to do that, and it might help to tip the balance between the spiralling violence, with the end of any prospect of peace, and a return to the negotiations that are the only route to a stable, just and secure future for all the peoples of the middle east.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first respond to the powerful and persuasive arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon? He asked pertinent and sometimes uncomfortably awkward questions about where the Barcelona process is going and the limits of our engagement, as the European Union and the British Government, in this fraught crisis. I should like to reflect on many of the points that my hon. Friend made, and perhaps write to him, because he raised some sharp issues about the direction of the process during the current conflagration in the region. That will, as he pointed out, be the subject of the Barcelona five session in April, under the Spanish presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank hon. Members, including my hon. Friend, for their contributions. It has been an interesting and sombre debate, at a key moment in the developing crisis. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton asked some fairly sharp questions, about educational aid for example. Those were, I think, partly answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield, but I should add that many of the allegations, which it was quite proper to mention, have, as a result of investigation by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, been shown to be unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the importance of delivering British and European aid in a responsible fashion, and, as well as enhancing the development of a new Palestine, promoting stability and peace. We strongly agree with the important point about the possibility that effective, targeted aid could be a powerful instrument in reducing economic resentment on the ground, which is the enemy of progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North made the compelling point that the problem is political and not just technical. I agree, and it would have been wrong if the Committee, particularly under your generous chairmanship, Mr. Amess, had concentrated only on the technical matters when the whole region is up in flames and people are killing each other in such a terrible way. I also agree with my hon. Friend that opinion is not monolithic on either side. There are still peace activists, in difficult conditions, in Israel, and there are democratic and progressive forces, which we need to encourage, both in the Palestinian Authority and generally in the Palestinian Authority region and the occupied territories. We must unlock those creative forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield showed his long-standing and committed interest in the region's problems. That is particularly true of his strong support—which I share—for Palestinian rights, and he has probably done as much work as anyone in that regard. He said that it was important to understand the concerns of his Israeli friends in Jerusalem and his Palestinian friends in Nablus, all of whom are caught up in this dreadful situation, and he speaks with great authority in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned an issue that he has persistently and quite properly raised with me before: goods from settlements. It is good that he does so, because Parliament should scrutinise the issue. It was raised at the European-Israeli association council on 20 November. There is evidence that goods from settlements are being imported as though they were of Israeli origin, and we have been working with our EU partners and Israel to find a solution that is compatible with EU law. This technical matter is governed by the terms of the association agreement. We have not yet reached a satisfactory outcome, but the association council agreed on 20 November to continue discussions at an expert level. I am glad that my hon. Friend raised the issue, because we cannot continue to put it on the back burner and must resolve it.

My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde said that it was important to have a lessons-learned mentality. He referred to a unit that was set up under the then UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali. I must say that my hon. Friend has educated me in that regard, because I was not aware of that unit. I am advised that the EU has a cross-cutting inter-service quality support group, part of whose responsibility is to learn lessons from different projects and programmes. I hope that my hon. Friend finds that reassuring.

My hon. Friend asked very pertinently why Israeli citizens who were active peacekeepers only a year or two ago were now Sharon voters. That goes to the heart of the issue because, as my hon. Friend said, Israeli citizens are completely terrified. It is difficult to see how the tit-for-tat violence that Israel inflicts on the Palestinians and the Palestinians inflict on Israeli citizens through suicide bombings can lead their communities anywhere other than down an increasingly dark and bitter cul-de-sac from which it

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
will be extremely difficult to emerge. I agree that there were faults on the Palestinian Authority side before Sharon, but very damaging faults and mistakes could be ascribed, too, to the Israeli Government. Those will not enhance the future security of Israel or its citizens, but, on the contrary, damage them.

My hon. Friend also mentioned the potential misuse of funding. I remind him that, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, European Community budgetary aid is accompanied by conditions, including accountability for funds and transparency. In addition, support is channelled through one line Ministry. As regards its assistance, the European Community employs strong monitoring mechanisms in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund. I am not saying that there have been no failures, because clearly there have, but we keep a beady eye on the situation. I should also remind my hon. Friend that British support is currently provided in the form of technical assistance or through non-governmental organisations, not in the form of direct funding to the Palestinian Authority. Several donors have now confidently begun using direct funding mechanisms that go through PA institutions, and we hope that that will generate greater confidence so that we can engage much further.

Overshadowing this debate are the awful tit-for-tat atrocities being committed by both sides. That is self-evidently a tragedy, and it is a frustration to the British Government and the European Union. Just 18 months ago in August 2000, when I was Minister responsible for the middle east, I recall meeting both Prime Minister Barak, as he then was, and President Arafat within hours of each other, travelling from Jerusalem to Gaza. We talked about the fraught issue of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
sovereignty over the Haram al-Sharif—the Temple mount. I carried a message between them and it was clear that they were very close. The differences were deep, yet they were incredibly close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to get back to that situation so that we can bring the two sides together to crack the negotiated settlement that I am confident is there for the cracking if only we can provide the conditions in which people stop killing each other and start talking. The European Union's commitment to the Mediterranean region is important to the Union's prosperity and security. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon. The regional conflagration is not isolated from us—it has the capacity to destabilise the whole world and could well do so if it is not resolved.

The Barcelona process is an important means of furthering Europe's relationship with our 12 Mediterranean neighbours. As has been said, the 1995 declaration established an equal partnership among 27 members and called for further co-operation on political and security issues, economic and social issues and cultural issues. I hope that the debate has contributed to extra energy being put into resolving an intractable problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
