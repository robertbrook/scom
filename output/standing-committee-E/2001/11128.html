	<p>[	<i>Relevant Documents: European Union Documents Nos. 5619/01 and 7218/01.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission's Green Paper is wide-ranging and it deals with an important area of policy from an economic and an environmental point of view. It comes at a time of increasing European Union energy dependence and the United Kingdom is closely examining security of supply issues as we face becoming a net importer. The performance and innovation unit, too, is undertaking a broad review of UK energy policy. We agree with the Green Paper's analysis of growing EU energy dependence and we support its main conclusions. I shall highlight three of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we support the view that security of supply entails reducing the potential risks associated with energy dependence rather than striving for self-sufficiency, even though the UK has enjoyed decades of self-sufficiency. Liberalised, integrated and competitive markets, in the EU and internationally, are central to security of supply. Liberalised markets can open up opportunities for investment and supply, and ensure that the right price signals are given to bring supply and demand into balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We strongly support the Commission's efforts, and those of fellow EU member states, to complete the single market in energy, and to promote economic reform in supplier countries and competition within and outside the EU. We therefore welcome the Commission's proposals for a directive to amend the existing electricity and gas directives and a regulation on cross-border electricity trading. Those proposals should go a long way towards completing the single market in energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we support the emphasis on measures to reduce the demand for fossil fuels, promote renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency. Such measures contribute to energy diversity and security, as well as to environmental objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we agree that the missing links in trans-European energy networks should be identified and action should be taken to facilitate completion if the links are necessary to ensure security of supply or the completion of the internal market. That is an area in which the Commission can provide real added value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on European Legislation—the Scrutiny Committee—has identified four important areas on which the merits of Community intervention should be examined. First, on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
harmonising fiscal policies, we are not convinced that different levels of energy taxation in member states would hamper the single market, or that a lack of harmonised energy taxation would distort competition between member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main aim of taxation is to raise funds for high quality public services. Member states choose an appropriate level of public service provision, taking account of a range of considerations. The tax levels needed to pay for those provisions will therefore differ. However, subject to certain provisions, we support the harmonising intent behind the proposed energy products directive and we accept that, on environmental grounds, minimum energy tax rates will be required throughout the EU for the business use of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we see no justification for the stockpiling at Community level of oil, gas or coal. It would be unnecessary, difficult and expensive. For oil, perfectly good emergency arrangements exist among the International Energy Agency countries and European Union and there could be problems with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. For gas, our priority of a liberalised market and dialogue with producer countries will provide the most effective safeguards for security. For coal, as there is no significant risk to external supply, we see no security of supply justification for supporting indigenous production or for exempting the industry from state aid rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, on whether aid for renewable energy should be funded by levies on existing energy sectors, it is important to ensure that the future benefits of the wider use of renewable energy are not outweighed by the costs on domestic and industrial consumers. Large UK electricity consumers are concerned that our target of 10 per cent, of electricity sales by 2010 could undermine their overseas competitiveness if other countries do not take similar measures. Any EU measures will therefore need to be considered carefully in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Government's 10-year plan for transport aims to secure a significant increase in the volume of freight carried by rail. Logistical realities, however, mean that most freight will continue to travel by road. We are working to minimise the impact of road freight by investing in measures to reduce congestion and improve the condition of our roads. Any Community measures would need to take account of the different transport systems of member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government support the main thrust of the Commission's proposals on the internal market, which require full market opening in both electricity and gas by 2005. They also require the key features necessary for a fully functioning competitive market to be in place, notably legal separation of monopoly networks, published non-discriminatory prices for network access and independent regulation. The system in Great Britain is largely compliant with the proposals already, although some changes would be required in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
There is general support among member states for the main elements of the proposals, but France and Germany have problems with some of them. France is resisting allowing its domestic consumers a choice of supplier but is prepared to liberalise its industrial and commercial sectors. Germany is in favour of full market opening, but has difficulties with the ex-ante regulation, legal separation in gas and published tariffs for access to networks. Some other member states also have concerns about legal separation for gas. Acceptable compromises will eventually be found on those issues, although the timetable will inevitably slip somewhat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There will be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions, so this is not the time for statements. That will come later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Key	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the Opposition do not seek, so far, to divide the Committee on the motion. However, will the Minister say when we can expect to hear a public statement to the House on the performance and innovation unit energy review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the Committee the timetable for the PIU energy review. I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question directly, but I hope that he will appreciate from what I say that I am not trying to obfuscate in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PIU energy review was always intended to be a six-month study. It was first requested by the Prime Minister immediately after the general election, so the final report should be completed by the end of the year and we are on target to meet that deadline. As the PIU review is a six-month study, it will point out other work to be done as well as drawing broad conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report will be published and will become the subject of debate in both Houses of Parliament and in the wider community of interest that it affects. I cannot say precisely when the report will be debated in the House. However, just as the whole process has been transparent, with all the submissions being posted on the website and a comprehensive sounding of views and advice being taken, the consultation on the published review will be equally comprehensive and will include discussion in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister enlarge on his reference to the changes that are required in Northern Ireland? He will be aware that we have long argued about differentials in fuel charges there. What changes will be made and when will they take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that a different situation prevails in Northern Ireland. I am well aware of concerns about the effect of any changes on industrial users of gas. I am responsible for Northern Ireland, just as I am for the rest of the United Kingdom, but on European energy issues in particular the writ of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
does not run to Northern Ireland. That has left the development of a competitive regime lagging some way behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Responsibility for implementing EU liberalisation proposals rests principally with Northern Ireland Executive Ministers, but my officials liaise closely with their counterparts in the Executive on the progress that is made in negotiations with other member states. They will factor in the views of interested parties in Northern Ireland. Initial feedback suggests that the main concern is to have a requirement to ensure that the new energy directive does not adversely affect the existing directive, which enables the grant of exclusivity for the transmission and supply of gas to facilitate the development of the emergent natural gas industry in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the Northern Ireland electricity market is 35 per cent. open and the requirement to open it fully by 2005 presents a significant, but not insuperable challenge. The transition to full market openness will require careful planning among the various players. Primary legislation may be necessary to effect the agreed changes to existing market structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the distinctive position in Northern Ireland is very much in our mind as we conduct negotiations with the EU and we are in close touch with the Executive there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister expand on the Government's nuclear policies in the light of the documents, which refer to nuclear energy as an undesirable option that would be satisfactory only if the problem of waste was sorted out? How do the Government's nuclear energy proposals fit in with the documents? Do they not run counter to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to stress that there are no proposals for nuclear energy at present. Equally, there has never been a moratorium on building nuclear power stations in this country—the fact is simply that in the past 20 years no one has thought it a good idea to do so. In future, commercial companies will take the decisions. The halcyon days of the Government deciding to build nuclear power stations are in the past and companies will take commercial decisions on whether to build them. As far as I am aware, there are no such proposals at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PIU report will cover nuclear and all other forms of energy generation. The PIU team is not predisposed one way or another on nuclear energy. The arguments will be set out and general conclusions will be drawn. The job of the PIU team is to examine the arguments for and against nuclear energy, just as it will examine those for and against renewables and increasing dependence on gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honest and clear position is that there is no policy and the PIU is being given no steer on nuclear energy. The merits and demerits of nuclear energy must be assessed along with those of other forms of energy. Waste is one element in that, and a separate review is being carried out under the auspices of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on what to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
To put the debate in context, at present the UK gets 25 per cent. of its electricity from nuclear sources, so they are a big and largely emission-free contributor. The corollary of companies deciding not to replace nuclear power stations will make the challenge of meeting our Kyoto obligations all the greater, as the contribution made by nuclear power is declining steeply. It will be down to 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. by 2020.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PIU report caused the problem to be tackled seriously, as it suggested that we could not ignore it. If a source, no matter what it was, that supplied 25 per cent of our energy needs were to disappear, we should ask whether that was desirable and what we could do to replace it. Those questions arise on nuclear power as they would on other forms of power generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like the Minister to mislead the Committee. On Tuesday, in a written answer, he told me that the percentage of electricity produced from nuclear sources by 2020 would be 7 per cent., not 2 or 3 per cent. Does the Minister agree that if we reduce electricity production from nuclear sources from 24 per cent. in 2005 to 7 per cent. in 2020, the vast majority of that capacity will be replaced by forms of energy that produce greenhouse gases, despite the Government's vast investment in renewables? Will he confirm that the rest of the European Union will have similar figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Those are exactly the balances and trade-offs to be considered, at present in the PIU report, but in time by the Government when we formulate policy. We create the policy framework, but companies will make proposals within that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing that I want the debate to become is an argument about nuclear versus renewables. In all foreseeable circumstances, there is a role not only for a substantial increase in the contribution from renewables, but for an increase in the targets that we can set for them beyond 2010. We can all feel good about setting targets, but we must ask whether they are deliverable. By all reasonable accounts, a 10 per cent, target for 2010 is challenging and we will have our work cut out to meet it. I want to meet it and go beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to encourage the growth and development of renewables in a way that will bring down the cost of generation, which is another tradeoff. We can all pay lip service to renewables, but if they shove electricity bills up, a broad body of opinion will suddenly consider them less attractive. A lot of work must be done on renewables. It is important to break the term down, as it is not generic, and consider the separate forms of generation, some of which have better prospects than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's basic point is right. In this job, one finds that there is opposition to everything, be it nuclear, windmills or coal. There should be a proper
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
debate about reliance on gas, especially imported sources of gas, on which we will become increasingly reliant in the circumstances that he described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 1.4 of a report of the Select Committee on European Scrutiny reminds us that member states have adopted the necessary national legislation for the freeing up of their internal markets, which the Minister supported in his statement. It also points out that infraction proceedings are presently being undertaken against the Governments of France, Luxembourg and Germany due to their unwillingness to proceed on liberalisation. Will the Minister tell us whether he thinks that the matter will be concluded within the time scale laid out in the draft proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making progress on liberalisation. However, I do not underestimate the inherent difficulties and the extent of the resistance to full liberalisation. That resistance comes particularly from France, which is not a great revelation. It is difficult to advance such an agenda in France during the run-up to the elections there, but work is continuing through the European institutions. The objective is clear and it is high on our list of priorities. We will continue to push the issue under the Belgian presidency and then under the Spanish presidency. We will keep it high on the agenda and achieve it, I hope, within the time scale to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. It is not easy. In France, they have different considerations and a different perspective. We have to win the argument through negotiation and pressure and without deviating from the objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grogan	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Selby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Annexe 3 of the Commission report deals with coal. The Minister said that he saw no justification for continuing coal subsidies on security of supply grounds after the current treaty expires in 2003. Are there other grounds on which the British Government might countenance the continued provision of aid to the coal industry throughout Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with everything else in Europe, there are processes of negotiation and different countries have different priorities and views, which synthesise into a policy to which we all sign up. As I have said in the past, if a successor coal regime is introduced in the EU, we will not allow our industry to be put at a relative disadvantage, on principle. However, our stated position is our starting point in the discussions and if another state aid regime is agreed to, we will reluctantly subscribe to it and it will then be part of the scheme to which we have subscribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for not hearing his opening words. He went on to talk about the harmonisation of fiscal taxes and I was not sure that he discriminated between measures designed to reduce demand and those designed to promote one form of energy supply over another. Are the Government opposed to both those types of fiscal taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said that the purpose of taxation is to raise revenue. Its primary function is not to achieve other desirable objectives. A mixture of incentives can be applied to achieve our objectives, particularly in relation to renewable energy. However, that should not be done through taxation—measures such as the renewables obligation are more effective. The obligation is not a tax but a clear message to the renewables industry that if it can propose projects, we will guarantee it a worthwhile return by guaranteeing it access to the grid and the payment of a premium price to give it that access. That is not a tax but a financial incentive, which I am sure will work well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to revert to the question of nuclear energy. Does the Minister agree that, despite there being obvious concerns about plant safety and the disposal of waste, for example, the matter under discussion is all about cleanliness, renewable energy, storage of energy and, perhaps more importantly, reducing the dependency of countries on outside sources of energy? In that case, would he agree that the nuclear way forward should be considered closely, especially when we bear in mind the dependency on nuclear generation of countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, which want to be admitted into the family of European nations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely that the continuing nuclear option should be looked at closely and compared with other options. There are several strands to the argument, including the contribution to our Kyoto targets and the security of supply. It is obvious that we have an indigenous industry, which may be in contrast to other countries where imports are an increasingly large factor. The problem is that as soon as one takes a balanced view of the nuclear industry, one is immediately branded as some sort of pro-nuclear freak, whose obsession in life is to build 15 nuclear power stations around the country. That is not my position or the position from which the PIU report starts, but I make no apology that we start from the position that the nuclear industry is highly valuable to this country. It makes a valuable contribution to our energy needs, is a clean source of energy and employs a large number of highly skilled people. It would be plain daft to throw all that away in a refusal to contemplate the prolongation of the nuclear industry. What I have said is not a conclusion on which we then build facts, however. We must consider all the facts relating to the nuclear industry as part of the current mix and ask the intelligent question, which no one should try to avoid, as to whether nuclear has a continuing role in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's argument is right and those who want to rule out the nuclear option conveniently ignore it on what are sometimes spurious grounds. We do not control what happens close to our own shores, given that France has a 70 per cent, nuclear dependency and that other countries depend on it that are less sophisticated than us and could benefit from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
our expertise. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that we should consider the continuing role of nuclear in our energy mix and should not start with prejudices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am probably the kind of pro-nuclear freak to whom the Minister has just referred and I make no apologies for it. He said that decisions about building nuclear capacity had been made on economic grounds. Will he confirm that the economics of energy supply are the way that they are because the nuclear industry alone is forced to internalise the entire environmental costs of its operation, including the cost of decommissioning? Does he agree that an energy strategy for the European Union should apply that good practice to every form of energy production, so that we have a level playing field when deciding on the economics of energy production?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I have allowed the debate to continue about the nuclear industry, but if hon. Members look at the motion before them they will see that it does not specifically mention it. We are bordering on the edges of the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Olner. I hear what you are saying, but the reports to which the motion refers focus strongly on issues such as the nuclear energy industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document before us mentions the "internal market" and
	<br><q><p>"common rules for … electricity and natural gas".</p></q>
The motion borders on the edges of the nuclear issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fairly bordering on the edges now, because I do not want to pre-empt anything in the PIU report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the responsibilities borne by the companies are as set out at the time of privatisation. Those who invested in the nuclear industry at that time knew what they were taking on, so I am not prepared to shed too many tears in that direction. Everyone is in favour of level playing fields in principle, but as soon as people begin to argue for a particular player, they are prepared to make exceptions here and there. In Scotland, in particular, there are those who argue that the nuclear industry is subsidised because of its contracts with the electricity industry. Others see subsidy for coal as a terrible evil. I do not, even if I have come to that view reluctantly. Obviously, in a sense there is subsidy for renewables, because of the renewables obligation. There are all sorts of tilts to the playing field and part of the work of the energy review will be to develop a rationale for that, and some transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the fiscal environment that Governments can create will affect decisions on investment in any form of generation, including nuclear. As I said earlier, Governments will not be building nuclear power stations in future, but clearly, those who decide whether to invest will be influenced by the context. The energy review will doubtless make a recommendation on that, but the Government will decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain, given his understandable and proper emphasis so far on renewables, why the new electricity trading arrangements militate against renewables and against combined heat and power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting and proper question. The explanation goes back to something that I said earlier about the balances involved. The new electricity trading arrangements have, in their own terms, been an enormous success. The wholesale price of electricity has dropped in a few months by about 25 per cent. That will feed through into bills for domestic consumers and industry. The man and woman in the street may not be intimately familiar with NETA, but if they are told that it has brought about electricity price cuts on that scale they are likely to be in favour of it. That is probably common ground. However, there are side effects, which impinge on Government policy. We are in favour of competitive markets and of cutting energy costs through efficiencies, as well as the trading arrangements that have been introduced but, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly implied, we are also in favour of renewables and combined heat and power. The question is to what extent does one set of objectives cut across the other, and what can we do about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact on renewables and on combined heat and power would not have been a reason not to introduce NETA, but it is a reason to study, at this early stage, the effect of each on the other, and to ameliorate any harmful effects, if possible, once they have been more precisely identified. That is why we are now carrying out a consultation on the impact of NETA on renewables and small generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman said, NETA is perceived to have had a particularly adverse effect on combined heat and power. That bothers me a lot. As I have said repeatedly, I shall not keep talking about targets for combined heat and power if the real trend is in the opposite direction. It is, however, fair to recognise that NETA is not the sole source of the current difficulties facing combined heat and power. Arguably, the high price of gas and the rapid increase in gas prices in the past year is a bigger factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will read the small print in yesterday's pre-Budget statement, which contains an interesting passage on combined heat and power. It recognises the difficulties and, while it does not provide a specific undertaking as to the climate change levy, it gives a pretty strong nod in that direction. We shall continue to work on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Olner. In your response to the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) you drew the Committee's attention to the terms of the motion. I seek your guidance on the status of the motion, given that it has yet to be moved. My understanding of the procedure of the Committee is that the Minister makes a statement and that we hold a Question Time before moving on to debate the motion to which the earlier point of order referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, but the Question Time relates to the subject matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Olner. I want this clarified, because it is an important issue. The resolution, when it is eventually moved, will refer to document 5619/01, which deals in general terms with security of energy supply by discussing the energy options that are available to European Union member states. In that context, discussions of renewables, nuclear power and other forms of energy supply would seem reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to steer the Committee towards understanding that the question was not totally about nuclear energy versus renewables or other forms of supply. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. All forms of energy and supply can be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the level playing field and the concept of private or Government activity. Does he think that the plan to use more renewables could be hindered by some planning law, particularly in England, when one bears in mind that private developers have had to go to Scotland to get on with renewable supply? Do the Government have any thoughts about how that will affect our hopes of reaching the target even by 2010?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. It is of concern to us and the answer is yes; I hope that we are on the point of doing something about it. The difficulty was made clear to me when I visited a wind farm that had just been opened in Cornwall. It was a modest affair of 16 windmills up a hill, doing no harm to anyone and barely visible from any inhabited area. It struck me as extraordinary that it was the biggest wind farm to open in England since 1993. At that rate of progress the percentage we reach by 2010 will not be 10 per cent, but 0.01 per cent. As a contribution to the country's energy needs that is a joke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not decry or underestimate people's right to obtain planning inquiries and to object to proposals, but systematic delay of every project is not compatible with our objectives. That is clear. It is pretty well established that while every proposal for a wind farm attracts objections, once wind farms are set up, the objections largely evaporate. The wind farms come to be regarded as good neighbour developments. Some bigger proposals are now being put forward for wind farms. I hope that the planning system will give them a fairer wind, where appropriate, than at some times in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I was the Minister responsible for this matter in Scotland we changed the planning rules and made projects transportable. If, once they had approval under the renewables obligation, or its predecessor arrangement, they ran into planning difficulties in the location originally proposed, another site could be sought without the need to go back to square one with respect to the obligation. That approach has been quite successful in freeing up projects and enabling them to make progress. That is clearly an option for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With particular reference to the hon. Gentleman's interests—and indeed my own—the other big barrier to the contribution to be made by renewables is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
infrastructure. In many of the places that are best suited to producing the stuff, the infrastructure is so weak that it cannot be got to where it is needed. It is relevant to Northern Ireland—and possibly to the Republic—that I have initiated a consultancy report on the feasibility of a sub-sea cable, down on the western seaboard of the British mainland. If that proves feasible and works, it could be good for renewables and the places that are capable of generating them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for reverting to the subject of tax measures, but when he referred to the renewables obligation he did not discuss the climate change levy, which seems to me to be a tax measure by another name, and designed to influence the choice of energy sources. If he believes that to be right in particular circumstances, does he find it acceptable in EU circumstances? Therefore, is his objection to the introduction of EU-wide measures, rather than to the use of physical measures to influence the choice of energy supply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to give a health warning which has the virtue of being absolutely true: all matters of taxation are for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury. We are not convinced by the suggestion that different levels of energy taxation in member states hamper the operation of a single market, or that a lack of harmonisation in energy taxation would lead to a distortion of competition between member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the climate change levy as a tax, but the primary purpose of taxation is to raise the funds necessary for public services. The main objective of the climate change levy is environmental. As I am sure that he knows, all its proceeds are channelled back through national insurance, so I do not accept what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, harmonisation can be beneficial. For instance, the UK supports the proposed energy products directive in its harmonising intent, subject to the domestic sector being exempt from its provisions. The Government recognise that there are environmental grounds for agreeing minimum energy tax rates for the business use of energy across the EU. I hope that satisfies the hon. Gentleman that, where appropriate, we are not theologically opposed to taking common action across Europe and do not see it as incompatible with our distinctive tax measures on energy issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony D. Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Yarmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the subject of renewables. There has been an application for an offshore wind farm in my constituency, but the time taken for permission to be granted for such a scheme seems to be a problem. Will the Minister reassure us that applications for offshore wind farms will be speeded up, as they obviously do not require the necessary planning applications for land-based wind farms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be pleased to come back to my hon. Friend on that case. If he gives me the details, I shall find out what the hold-up is and what the prospects are for resolving it. He is right to say that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
issues related to land-based wind farms do not apply, but there are other problems. A range of maritime bodies—fishing interests and so on—have to be consulted about any offshore proposal, but we place a high degree of reliance on offshore wind as a contributor to our renewables target. Offshore wind is one of the major beneficiaries of the £100 million that we have recently announced as an additional tranche of money to encourage renewables, so we share the interest in substantially getting the projects going without undue delays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister about the importance of the trans-European networks. Who regulates the price of the British-Belgian gas interconnector? It cannot be the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, because its writ stops at the coast. Will the Minister confirm that the regulation of price is the subject of an international agreement between the two Governments that is exempt from standard EU law? Will he explain why, when the pipe is closed for maintenance, the price of gas in the EU stays the same but the price in Britain falls? The oligopolistic ownership of the pipeline may have some bearing on that, and on the high price in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coincidentally, I met the Belgian Energy Minister last night, and we discussed the increasing importance of that pipeline in anticipation of Britain becoming a net importer of gas during the next decade. We shall work closely together to facilitate the link being used to bring gas in our direction rather than in the other direction, as has primarily been the case. The pipeline is regulated, but it is privately owned, so although the two countries will co-operate, the UK-Belgian agreement on the gas interconnector does not regulate prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matters raised by the hon. Gentleman are very relevant to security of supply and to gas prices in the UK. We are conducting an investigation into the surge in gas prices during the past year. The price has fallen back now, but it was obviously a major source of concern to industry, and I am keen to get to the bottom of it. We need to understand the forces that pushed prices up so sharply. Although we may think that we know the answers—some, particularly those in industry who were adversely affected by that surge, have their own theories on how and why it happened— it is important for us to listen to the industry and to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent it from happening again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past year, some companies have seen prices excluding the climate change levy rise by about 44 per cent. Those price increases have come from somewhere. We want to know exactly why they happened, and the questions put by the hon. Gentleman can usefully be included in that review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the main document, which gave us all such wonderful nighttime reading. The technical section states:
	<br><q><p>"these changes will depend on the power of authorities or regulators to intervene".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
What is the Government's view of such intervention? I understand that they are reluctant to press Ofgem to intervene on NETA to help CHPs. Will the Minister explain the Government's policy on intervention in that context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ofgem is independent. Most hon. Members would agree that that is as it should be. If Ofgem were simply an instrument of government, the benefits that we seek, which include a reduction in prices and an increase in competition, would be less likely. In the Utilities Act 2000, we defined the role of Ofgem as regulator, and Ofgem will be left to get on with the job. At the same time, its remit of social and environmental responsibilities has still to be fully defined. I hope that we shall do that in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ofgem is aware of the effect of NETA on renewables and CHPs. Its primary role, however, is not to solve such problems but to foster competition and reduce the price of electricity. A balance must be struck. The role of an independent regulator vis-à-vis the Government raises almost philosophical issues, which we shall not resolve through megaphone diplomacy. It is reasonable for us to make clear in discussions with Ofgem the unintended consequences of NETA and its other policies, and it should take account of that. None the less, it remains an independent regulator and we do not want to challenge its independence, which we so recently created and reinforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Luke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much has been said about supply and demand. The question of how we conserve energy efficiency and retain security of supply has not been as prominent as I thought it would be. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a vital component of any future policy in Britain and Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. Energy efficiency has been a Cinderella topic in the UK: everyone pays lip service to the idea, but we have had limited success in achieving it, particularly in the domestic sector. There has been much greater success in the industrial and service sectors, which have a more obvious financial imperative to reduce energy demand. Energy efficiency in the domestic sector has improved by only about 2 per cent. in the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we can see the benefits of energy efficiency at a personal level. I was involved in a couple of events last week. We launched our fuel poverty strategy in London under the warm zone scheme, which is a proactive way of targeting people's energy needs to help them improve their energy efficiency. I visited the home of a lady who had had central heating and insulation put in under the scheme. She will not only make her home more energy efficient, but reduce her bills by about £300 in a year, which is a substantial reduction. Last week was also Scottish energy action week and I visited a home in my constituency that was being provided with insulation. Again, it was warmer, less energy was being used and the occupants saved substantially on their electricity bills. When we boil the issue down to the individual level, we find that a lot is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
going on. Last month alone, 23,000 homes were insulated under the Government's warm homes initiative, and 3,500 central heating units were installed. The measures benefit people by saving energy and lowering bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The profile of energy efficiency can be raised and the PIU will deal seriously with that. We have not begun to tap the benefits that come from energy efficiency. It is a vital corollary of the other measures that we are pursuing to reduce demand. We want to make serious inroads into improving energy efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documents say something about security of supply of energy and a lot about security of transfer, which is slightly different. Perhaps, however, we should focus on demand, with which the documents deal very little. We touched briefly on wind power and have not mentioned biomass, but a whole raft of issues will be important if we are to satisfy the demands of Kyoto. Does the Minister agree that the focus may be wrong and that, although the debate mentions supply, we need to consider alternative sources of energy? The documents deal little with that question—they are more interested in security of transfer than security of supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. We must maximise our domestic generation potential. I was interested in his mention of biomass, because that relates back to the point about objections made by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth). Last week, I visited some businesses in Ely in Cambridgeshire and the area nearby. The two guys that I met told me that they represented the entire British biomass industry. That is slow progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the question, because an application has been made for a biomass plant in my constituency, on the Isle of Arran. At the Labour party conference, I shared a debate with the director of Greenpeace, and told him, "We all know what you are against, would you mind telling us what you are for?" He said that the organisation's strategy was to cut demand by 2050 by 50 per cent, and that the other 50 per cent. would come from renewables. I told him that that was very interesting but that I would not want to bet my children's future on it. When I asked him which forms of renewables he favoured, he said biomass. I told him, "That's interesting because when the first commercial biomass plant in Scotland was proposed in my constituency, there was a petition of 800 objections to it. I would bet my bottom dollar that half of those who signed it are members of Greenpeace." The conscience must be squared with the intellect and if people say that they are in favour of renewables, they should not try to block proposals when they come along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) is right to say that we should diversify our generation sources. That takes us back to the nuclear question. The trade-offs against imported gas have to be considered, as do the potential sources of imported gas
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
and all that must be put together in such a way as to guarantee us long-term security of generation and supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documents seem a little short on geo-political analysis. Have the Commission or the Government taken account of policy announcements by those such as the Russian Government? They have been open about their intention to shift their internal energy demands away from gas and oil, so that by the latter two thirds of the century they can dominate the world market in those sources and sell them to the European Union, because they are convinced that we are not going to able to reduce our demand in time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which relates back directly to what I have just said. We have gone from a standing start to being heavily dependent on gas and, within a few years, will be net importers of gas. We will remain heavily dependent on gas that will come not from the North sea but from various sources throughout the world. There is lots of gas in the world and a lot of the gas that we use will undoubtedly come from Norway and other sources that people would agree are stable. However, as my hon. Friend says, we will be in a seller's market, which presents issues of its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the PIU review, it is important that we take account of the geo-political considerations and that we project ahead to 2050, as we are obliged to do. We are not talking about Russia, Kazakhstan or Algeria as those countries are today. We must look ahead 50 years and consider whether it is a good idea to be 70 per cent. dependent on gas, with 90 per cent. of that gas being imported. We need to know exactly where the gas will come from and be able to reach an informed conclusion about the conditions of supply that will pertain at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>That this Committee takes note of European Union documents Nos. 5619/01, the Commission Green Paper, Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply, and 7218/01, relating to common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas; and supports the Government's welcome of both these documents as the Green Paper provides analysis of the energy supply situation and the proposed Directive and Regulation would increase competition in the internal energy market and facilitate cross-border trading in electricity and thereby contribute to security of supply.—[	<i>Mr. Wilson.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have this opportunity to give the Conservative party's response to the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that strikes me forcibly is the way in which our energy needs and patterns of consumption have changed. We now recognise that the nations of Europe constitute the world's largest energy importer and second largest energy consumer. We are importing more and more energy from beyond our borders— about 50 per cent., but that could rise to 70 per cent. for the European Union countries in 20 years' time.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
We are also putting increasing pressure on the energy supply system and European energy consumption is rising by about 2 per cent. a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greater energy use is increasing our greenhouse gas emissions precisely when we are committed to reducing them. Part of the reason for that is our reluctance to reduce energy consumption and wastage. In that area, unlike other areas, every single citizen can make a difference through patterns of domestic consumption and decisions such as whether to leave the little red button on their television sets glowing and whether to insulate their homes. Some of those issues have been neglected. In previous years, we made a brave attempt to encourage loft insulation and the use of draught excluders but that has now been left to do-it-yourself and to those who visit Homebase and B&Q on Saturdays and Sundays. I suspect that each one of us needs to take a more responsible attitude to such things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that there has been a sluggishness in the UK to exploit renewable energy sources. It has seemed to me for a long time—perhaps, parading my green credentials, since I was the warden of a field study centre, when I had a proper job as a teacher many years ago—that there is something innately conservative about renewable energy resources: about seeking to generate power as close as possible to the point of consumption, about minimising our use of power and, above all, about using natural resources. After all, the islands of the UK are the one part of the European continent where we could probably generate almost all our energy from renewable sources. As the Minister said, that would be extremely difficult because it would require us to set up interconnectors along the west coast, which could be extremely expensive and, given the overall balance in energy policy that the Government must achieve, would not be achievable in my lifetime. With the Minister, I will be pushing up the daisies before we see that vision become reality, but that does not mean that we should abandon or ignore it—quite the reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman says about the practical difficulties of exploiting renewables, but I disagree with his first statement that we could produce all our energy from renewables if we wanted. How could we deal with issues such as base load? Has the hon. Gentleman read the royal commission report on climate change and energy production, which suggested that it would not be possible to overcome the practical difficulties and produce all our energy from renewables, even if we wanted to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said, "not in my lifetime" because of the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman rightly identifies.

As the Minister said, we do not start with a clean sheet of paper. All of us who are involved in discussions of energy policy know that we have inherited a massive backlog of problems from previous

generations. Every advance in energy technology produces its downside. The coal industry produced massive environmental disadvantages and huge social problems and it is the same with every succeeding generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not to be deflected by the hon. Member for South Thanet from saying what I intended to say, the nuclear industry is another challenge. I was absolutely fascinated by the intervention of the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross). With typical Liberal credentials, he mentioned the first sentence on nuclear energy, where the Green Paper says that nuclear energy and solid fuels are the undesirables among energy products, but he did not even finish the sentence, which ends by stating:
	<br><q><p>"their contribution within the global energy balance, which is restricted almost exclusively to the generation of electricity, is enormous."</p></q>
The section on nuclear energy in the document ends by stating:
	<br><q><p>"The European Union must retain its leading position in the field of civil nuclear technology, in order to retain the necessary expertise and develop more efficient fission reactors and enable fusion to become a reality."</p></q>
Before the hon. Gentleman rushes out a new edition of the Liberal "Focus" newsletter in Teignbridge, I must warn him that I will circulate copies of the record of the Committee around his constituency. I will not be deflected by the threat of Liberal "Focus".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman never heard of the waste paper directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that that is directed at focus groups all over the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to read the speech to the London School of Economics of Loyola de Palacio, the Commission Vice-President responsible for transport and energy, in which she said
	<br><q><p>"Another challenge to our energy security is the decision by some member states to phase out nuclear power. I find it very difficult to see how we can tackle climate change and maintain a diverse energy base unless we retain the nuclear option. Although I fully respect the decisions made by member states, it seems wise, in my view, to keep the options open."</p></q>
I agree. I am also reminded that European integration was founded on energy policy. The European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom were the first institutions of the European Union. That is why we must take the matter seriously, and indeed we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recognise that the European Coal and Steel Community, as one of the founding treaties of the European Union, is due to expire. The Green Paper rather dismisses the future contribution of coal to the energy mix. If coal and nuclear both declined, our problems of security of supply might be greatly exacerbated. Does my hon. Friend agree that the EU should consider promoting some of the new technologies that might enable coal to continue to make an economical contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clean coal technology undoubtedly has a future. The question is where that future lies. I suggest that we must handle dirty coal technologies first, but I agree with my hon. Friend. There are, as ever, conflicting objectives in energy policy. On the one hand we want low price and constant supply, and coal can certainly meet those criteria. On the other hand, we have a problem with producing coal electricity cleanly. I refer my hon. Friend to the current situation in which the increase in the price of gas has led to some old coal-fired power stations coming back on stream, notably the one at Tilbury, which is now pumping out the filthiest emissions of a kind that most of us thought had disappeared years ago. That is because of energy prices in Britain. However, I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) brought that up, because the future of the European Coal and Steel Community has been marginal to EU development in recent years, and we can no longer allow that. We must give it the consideration it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to read the resolution of the European Parliament on the Green Paper, published in the minutes of 15 November 2001. It pointed out the mix of different EU electricity generation throughout the Community. The figure for nuclear power is 35 per cent., for solid fuel 27 per cent. and for gas 16 percent. Incidentally, the UK's gas figure is about 39 per cent. and rising. The EU figure for renewables is 15 per cent., but it is about 2.8 per cent. in the UK. The figure for oil is 7 per cent., but it is only 1.5 per cent. here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament resolution mentioned the dependency of the EU on middle east countries for 41 per cent. of our oil imports, the security of which depended largely on the foreign and military policy of the United States of America. It suggested that we depended on Russia for 41 per cent. of our gas imports and 18 per cent. of oil imports, and on Algeria for 29 percent. of our gas imports and that 95 percent. of our uranium requirements were met from imports. We cannot afford to ignore the international dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pleasing that the European Parliament document made an interesting statement, the thrust of which I agree with, about the need to
	<br><q><p>"encourage the shift towards zero-carbon emission fuels for power, notably electricity generation from nuclear energy, hydrogen for transport fuel from biomass, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy sources, both by removing existing legislative obstacles and by making them subject to a specific EU-wide exemption from all excise duties, energy taxes or climate levies and also by providing incentives to encourage a shift towards efficient energy production plants, including combined heat and power."</p></q>
I agree with the thrust, but not with the tax policy or regime that the Parliament promotes. Nevertheless, it recognised the importance of the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document went on to discuss the role of nuclear power. Paragraph 47 of the resolution states that the European Parliament
	<br><q><p>"Recommends that special emphasis be placed on research into new designs for safer and less costly fission reactors with more efficient fuel consumption, given the need, whatever the future of nuclear power may be, to remain sufficiently capable of drawing upon a diverse range of energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, should dramatic geostrategic shifts in the world

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
or a sudden adverse trend in climate change render it vital to update nuclear power stations in Europe once the current generation of power stations reaches the end of its useful life".</p></q>
That is startling, given that it comes from the European Parliament. We do not normally associate such sentiments with the feelings expressed by our representatives there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document continued by calling on
	<br><q><p>"Member States who presently enjoy the benefits of nuclear generation of electricity which have not already made provision for the treatment and disposal of their own radioactive waste material to adopt appropriate measures as soon as possible"</p></q>
and encourage much more research into the subject, which is absolutely right. We need more research, because the nuclear industry has a problem. There is not a lot of public debate on energy, let alone nuclear energy, although there is a mass of prejudice from small numbers of people. What public debate there is suggests that the nuclear industry of the future will somehow be dominated by the problems of the past. That is not the case. We must remember that the origins of the nuclear industry lay in defence. The choice of fuels and the processes that led to the civilianisation of nuclear energy in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was defence led. That is in the past and when we decide whether to pursue a nuclear future, we should bear that legacy in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also fascinated by the inquiry by Sub-Committee B in another place into security of energy supplies in the EU, in response to the Green Paper that we are debating. I was interested in the submission from Dr. Burckhard Bergmann, the chairman of the executive board of Ruhrgas AG from Essen in Germany. He was interrogated by their Lordships, who asked:
	<br><q><p>"Is there a need for a European Energy Policy? What effect would a European Energy Policy have on global markets?"</p></q>
He replied:
	<br><q><p>"A policy for safeguarding energy supplies must take account of the respective national conditions, i.e. be based on the principle of subsidiarity. Responsibility for energy policy should therefore continue to be borne primarily by national governments. There is no need to include an energy chapter in the EU Treaty or increase the powers of the EU Commission in the field of energy policy."</p></q>
And so say all of us in the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also delighted to discover an exchange between Lord Brabazon of Tara and the Minister of State. According to the Minister's explanatory memorandum, Lord Brabazon wrote to him on 10 July 2001, saying that
	<br><q><p>"the United Kingdom is already virtually compliant with the requirements in the proposed Directive, and the electricity and gas markets operating in the United Kingdom are compatible with the proposals in both the Directive and the Regulation."</p></q>
He then asked about
	<br><q><p>"the position of all the other Member States on this important aspect of the liberalisation of energy markets in the European Union."</p></q>
The Minister replied on 18 August, saying:
	<br><q><p>"France is resisting 100 per cent, market opening and will, at present, only commit to liberalising down to industrial and commercial customers. We understand that there is no possibility of the French Government agreeing to allow domestic customers a choice of supplier until after the Presidential elections in May 2002. We are hopeful, however, that the French will agree on a final date for full liberalisation at that stage. You referred to French reluctance to open their gas market and may wish to note
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
that the Commission is taking legal action against the French Government for failure to implement the 1998 Gas Directive on time. The Commission is taking similar action against Germany too. These are moves which we strongly support.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Germany is in favour of full market opening, but has fundamental objections to many of the Commission's proposals, particularly independent regulation and transparent and nondiscriminatory tariffs for access to the network. The Germans are not supported by other Member States on the substance, but German resistance serves France's purposes well, at the present at least."</p></q>
The Minister concluded by saying:
	<br><q><p>"The liberalisation timetable is therefore inevitably going to slip, as the proposals also have to be agreed by the European Parliament. The UK Government's view, however, is that, provided the structural measures and a final date for market opening are agreed, a one or two year delay is acceptable."</p></q>
That is astonishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a parliamentary question on encouraging competition in the energy market, and last night I received an answer dated 27 November. The Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"The Government supports the proposals published earlier this year by the Commission to complete the internal energy market by 2005"—</p></q>
I suppose that I can give him that two-year slippage. He continues:
	<br><q><p>"These measures would provide the mechanisms and regulatory structures needed for a functioning single market in electricity and gas.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The proposals are currently being negotiated in the Energy Council, where we are seeking their early adoption."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 2001; Vol. 375, c. 787W.]</p></q>
I want to press the Minister on that. We cannot afford to put up with such slippage. By giving the Minister hell over the next couple of years, I hope that we shall encourage him to push the Commission to persuade the German and French Governments to behave responsibly towards consumers. It is outrageous that French consumers must put up with an absurd arrangement that we have not experienced for a decade. The coalition Government in Germany includes the Greens, and it is astonishing that they wish to hold up the introduction of transparency into energy transmission. That tells me that a lot of people wandering around Brussels must be on another planet. Consumers in Germany and France should have something to say about that, even if the oligopolistic approach to energy is more prevalent in those countries than it is here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the development of security of supply in Europe, energy transmission in France and Germany is a huge impediment not only to a potential European policy, which is not desirable or likely to work, but to the consumer interests of all the countries in the European Union. Britain has led the way in creating and opening up the single market, and we must not stop now but continue to apply pressure. I urge the Minister for Industry and Energy to use every fibre in his body and campaign as in the old days, when he campaigned on the 	<i>West Highland Free Press,</i> in the interests of consumers not only in the West Highlands but in the European Union as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
I should let you into a secret, Mr. Olner. When I was younger, we used to go on holiday to the West Highlands of Scotland, where I would read the 	<i>West Highland Free Press</i> and see what the Minister was up to—and hasn't he done well!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face a geo-political risk. We are at the risk of swings in the politics of the middle east, in particular, and must recognise that there are potential areas of instability in that region that we must encourage to remain stable. If the worst happened, it would be very serious for us indeed. On the other hand, I am convinced that the situation in Russia is more stable than we could have dreamed even five years ago. The whole Russian nation is now economically driven and, given that Russia is deeply dependent on exports of energy, we can have some confidence that the supply from that country is reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have confidence in security of supply—that little bit of the energy equation is fine—but diversity of supply is a different matter. As the Government know, we must maintain that balance in our energy sources, which, whether by design or good fortune, is better than it has been in our history. On the whole, Governments do not make good decisions about diversity but react to individual circumstances, making short to medium-term rather than long-term decisions. People ask why the French are 70 per cent. dependent on nuclear power, but that was a direct result of the French Government's response to the oil shock of the 1970s. At the same time, when we were discussing Sizewell, we made similar judgments. However, as the Minister said, in future Governments will not be the ones building nuclear reactors, even if they decide on that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In achieving the right balance, we must identify market imperfections. We hope that the market will find a solution, but we have to trust Governments to tweak market solutions to improve them in the overall policy equation. For example, as I may say in response to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who spoke about coal, the new electricity trading arrangements will encourage a resurgence in that fuel. Of that I have little doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the infrastructure in security of supply throughout Europe and the United Kingdom, where there are real problems. Gas is landed at five points in the country, but there is no economic nexus between the offshore producers and Transco, for example. One may consider the cases of St. Fergus and Bacton. It is difficult for Ofgem to know what it should say, or whether it should say anything at all to persuade Transco to put in particular investment at a particular point. For example, if we wanted to increase our imports of gas from Norway, it is no use suggesting that we should do that through a particular landfall if the capacity does not exist. I suspect that Ofgem has a responsibility to encourage Transco to respond to market signals, and I suspect that Ofgem is doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the electricity distribution system in Europe and in the United Kingdom. We have a legacy from the Central Electricity Generating Board in the national
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
grid, but some major constraints are imposed by planning. The point has been raised already that we have an opportunity in the Government's decision to review planning procedures further to encourage the sensible and appropriate distribution of electricity in the UK. The fact is that we suffer huge transmission losses, about 9 per cent. of electrons being lost in transmission. That is pretty unacceptable. I hope that we shall see a drive towards electricity being generated closer to the point of consumption—as I said, it is a deeply conservative principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some things are going wrong, however. The north Yorkshire line is an example that must be close to the Minister's heart for the grief that it causes him—not to mention the people of north Yorkshire. We also have a little problem with the storage of gas in the salt deposits in Northwich. Some planning issues need to be considered. We also have the problems of balancing energy hour by hour, the profiling of energy and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Minister addresses the problem of investment in power generation. It is a complex matter. Generally speaking, when prices are low there is no incentive to invest. That is one of the problems in California; the low prices there are artificial because they are capped, but it led to energy suppliers signing contracts that made supplies much more expensive than the capped price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quite follow another aspect of our energy policy. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the Committee. At the moment, long-term contracts available for the purchase of electricity supply are simply not taken up. That is one aspect of NET A that is not working properly. Why is that? I believe that companies are not taking up those long-term contracts because of uncertainty about future oil prices. I applaud the fact that we have the best energy market if not in the world certainly in the EU, but that uncertainty is a disincentive for suppliers of electricity for retail consumption to take up long-term contracts. That needs to be investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the balancing necessary for the day-to-day security of supply, which will involve some tweaking. I know that studies are being made into what would happen if a major energy supplier simply went bankrupt. The globalisation of ownership of those resources and assets means that we cannot ignore the fact that one of the big retailing companies could go bust—not a UK company, perhaps, but one in the United States of America. What measures are the Government taking to address the potential collapse of one of our major suppliers, which could be extremely disruptive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have asked why NETA is not working for small producers. I suspect that NETA includes consolidation arrangements but, for one reason or another, they seem not to be working. If consolidation arrangements were in place, all the little producers of CHP such as wind farms could get together and, at least in theory, they could sell to the market. But such arrangements are not in place. Not even medium-sized producers such as Slough Heat and Power Ltd, which I visited last Thursday, can sell
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
electricity. As a result, it is operating at only 50 per cent capacity, even though it generates from waste products. That needs investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that the NETA system is not working in Scotland. My recollection is that the retail price of electricity and gas in Scotland used to be about 10 per cent. below the English price; it is now 10 per cent, above it. That is strange. Particularly as the Minister for Industry and Energy is Scottish, I do not understand why Scottish consumers face higher prices than English consumers? The answer obviously has something to do with NETA and our system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is valid. My figures are 5 per cent. below and above. However, he will remember that privatisation in Scotland, where the two existing companies were privatised on a vertical basis, differed significantly from privatisation in the rest of the UK. He is talking about the legacy of that privatisation. I can assure him that examining how Scottish consumers can receive the same benefits of competition as consumers elsewhere is high on Ofgem's list of priorities and on mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. I will quickly conclude, because others want to have their say. We welcome the conversion of the Labour party to the benefits of market liberalisation in energy. We applaud the progress that they have made. We urge them to try much harder, particularly in Europe with France and Germany, in the interest not only of consumers in those countries but of the whole of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe strongly in a balanced energy policy. It is certainly my wish to see this country greener than the greenest dreams. We must take every opportunity to use sensible and sustainable renewables, because they have a huge contribution to make to our nation's quality of life. Above all, I hope that a real interest in energy issues will develop in this country, because such an interest has been lacking for a long time. Almost every debate on television and in the newspapers is about the negative aspects of energy in the UK, such as whether or not we should use nuclear power or some aspect of pollution. It is all negative, and that is very sad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that nowhere does the document discuss in sufficient detail the European attitude and policy towards offshore wind farms, which we have briefly discussed this morning? There does not seem to be a coherent European strategy towards one of the cleanest available sources of energy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but as the Minister said earlier, there is always an objection to everything when it comes to energy. I happen to be strongly in favour of offshore wind farms, in that I am strongly opposed to onshore ones. If we can have offshore ones, which cause less grief, that would seem desirable. However, I have received representations from the Fleetwood inshore fishermen, who are upset about the prospect of an offshore wind farm south of Barrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
When I was a boy fishing on the west coast of Scotland, I always found that a man-made structure such as a ship or a wreck was wonderful for inshore fishing, but I digress—the debate is very serious. We need to take energy more seriously in this country. We have progressed beyond the sandal and beard era of discussing alternative energy. We must have a hard-headed, scientifically based, politically led energy policy, not only for the United Kingdom but for all the nations of the European Union. I hope that we will be able to proceed with the motion in that spirit and agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and give other hon. Members the opportunity to speak. There are two principal issues. First, there is the document, which is fairly worthy. The liberalisation of European markets is a necessity. We are sometimes at a disadvantage and it would be to our benefit to deliver the changes contained in the document across the European market. It has always concerned me, however, that when we meet in Committee to discuss European matters, we end up making agreements that disadvantage British industry. There are dangers and pitfalls that could put us at a disadvantage and we have strayed into those because of the way in which NETA has been introduced and the way it is working. I hope that those will be dealt with in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree about the need to cut energy requirements. We are very poor at that. I have spent most of my life working in architecture and building. I have worked on building sites and on the design of homes. I appreciate that there is much good intent. There is an idea that, by changing the building regulations several times, insulation can be increased. If it is increased in poorly designed houses and everyone shuts the doors and windows, there is condensation and the first response to that is to open the doors and windows, thus undermining the efficiency of the 2 in of loft insulation. We need to be a little more sophisticated in our house design.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A crucial point that has not been made is the need to cut energy requirements as a part of transport policy. We waste and pollute a lot. Probably quite a few hon. Members in this Room do so by rushing up and down motorways—not too fast, I hope. We could rely on public transport policy to help reduce that sort of behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked about the nuclear option and I was pleased that the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) saw fit to draw widely on the document, which finds that there are advantages in that option. However, it warns of a difficulty in decommissioning and ways of dealing with waste products. The document also warns that some European countries have moratoriums, which lead it to conclude that there will be difficulties in expanding nuclear options in Europe. We must deal with the waste issues if we want to expand the nuclear industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the expansion of nuclear facilities. Is that the policy of his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The line is very clear. It will be possible to expand the industry only if the waste problem is dealt with. Until we have dealt with it I, and my party, do not believe that we should expand the industry. That is fairly consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone recognises that we need to tackle the problem of waste. Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that an inquiry is under way, under the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which will have taken five years to draw conclusions? Does the hon.

Should we keep the nuclear option open pending the outcome of the inquiry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have favoured a moratorium on nuclear power some time ago while we sorted out the problems.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have given way twice already and shall not do so again. There are concerns to be dealt with and I think that I have made my party's position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Salisbury wants to come to Teignbridge to explain my party's position and distribute his torch leaflets. That will double his party's delivery network and I am sure that it will be welcomed. However, if he is so much in favour of explaining the nuclear option, and as the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) is so eloquently in favour of nuclear power, perhaps he should move the nuclear power station to East Devon rather than Teignbridge. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Salisbury says that there is not one in Teignbridge; I want to protect against his policies ever putting one there. However, it would not need to be that close. The dangers of nuclear waste and the problems of radiation spread far, as we learned from Chernobyl a few years ago, and as we nearly learned from Three Mile Island.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is a potential for growth in coal, but there is always the danger that a growth in coal will mean that we must import it, rather than being able to use what has always been a natural product in the UK. It has been irresponsible Government policy to allow the disposal and seizing up of the supply of a potential resource that should have been kept open. I certainly hope that coal options, including clean coal, will be explored and that those options will promote the British coal industry rather than allowing its wholesale destruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I generally welcome the document. There is a need for liberalisation, which, I hope, will lead to lower prices and to the security of the UK energy supply. We are benefiting from the fact that OPEC is unable to increase oil prices, partly because of the Russian market. That cannot always be guaranteed and may present dangers in, not the medium, but the near future, so we need secure power sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Teignbridge, the energy policy of the Liberal Democrats, like Liberal Democrat policy on so many things, panders to what they perceive to be the public wish without addressing any of the real problems. When a party has no prospect of getting into power, it can easily cop out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me comment before I give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy for Liberal Democrats to say what they will not do if they will never have to say what they will do. It is easy for them to talk about their commitment to renewable sources because they will never be in a position to deliver on that commitment. I know of no engineer, scientist or person who has worked in the industry generating renewable electricity who believes, in his wildest dreams, that the Liberal Democrat target for energy production from renewables—50 per cent.—is even remotely achievable. Such people would be delighted if we could achieve half that target. To base energy policy on a complete pipedream is irresponsible in the extreme. If the hon. Gentleman will tell me which engineers, companies or scientists think that that target is remotely achievable, I will gladly follow up any references he can give me to find out what those people have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not quote a list of people trading in the different sectors, but many people feel that there is a greater need—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman says that the Liberal Democrats are pandering to the public but our policy on renewable options is long standing. We expressed doubts about the nuclear option at a time when it was favoured by the public, so our policy goes back somewhat further than his memory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point. The Liberal Democrats never offer references for the sources of their policies or even any evidence that they are remotely deliverable. They pander to the fears that they have helped to generate in the public mind and they do a disservice to the public by reducing debate to that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Salisbury said, we must get the debate going again and engage people in the real issues about energy supply and the options that face us. I was going to say how eloquent and well-structured the hon. Gentleman's comments were and what a helpful contribution he had made to the debate, but then he began to wobble. The last time that I saw such a wobble was when I watched a unicyclist at Covent Garden—I think that a bee was trying to sting him. The hon. Gentleman's wobble included him saying that there was no need for a European energy policy. I shall return to that issue in a moment because I believe that there is a need for such a policy. He talked about knowing that we could rely on the supply of gas from Russia. He is right to the extent that the Russians have made it clear that they intend to sell the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
west and the European Union large amounts of oil and gas well into the future. There will, therefore, be continuity of supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently discussed the issue with the first secretary at the Russian embassy. The Russians might have been communists once upon a time, but they are no longer. They intend not to give us the gas or sell it to us at subsidised prices, but to keep it until they dominate the marketplace and control the price. They will then sell it to us at a price that we shall have to pay. We shall have consumed all the gas and oil to which we have access and which we control and our economy will be in their hands. That is the Russian perception of the course of the energy debate during this century, and I mean this century. I have had discussions with representatives of other countries, but only the Russians have a 100-year energy policy. They are engaged in long-term thinking, while we never move beyond the middle of the century and sometimes not even beyond the next five or 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the Russians would have us over the proverbial barrel if we did not have a policy to ensure diverse energy supply. I hope that we shall not depend on gas for 80 per cent. of our supplies, but even if we do depend on it to a greater extent, the development of liquid petroleum gas markets in Nigeria, northern South America and perhaps the Caribbean will alleviate the problem. We must have a balanced policy and rule nothing out at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. The hon. Gentleman suggests why we need a European energy policy. We may take a balanced view of energy issues and of the need not to rely on gas, and a responsible view of investing in renewables and energy conservation. However, if other European Union nations are allowed to make decisions that pander to the feelings to which the Liberal Democrat party panders and decide to build their energy policy entirely around gas, they could undo all that we are trying to do. It is, therefore, important that the EU takes a Union-wide view of energy policy and has a way of controlling what each nation does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unacceptable that some nations can declare for ever a moratorium on certain types of energy production. They should at least keep an open mind and engage their European partners in debate. The policy of the Irish Government is extremely unwise and, one could even argue, dishonest. They attack the development of nuclear power in this country while engaging in energy production practices that contribute grossly to global warming. We must consider all the aspects of energy production, not just one. The European Commission should be involved in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to countries with a moratorium. He asked earlier for a list of people in the industry and perhaps he should write to them, because their advice clearly advocates a moratorium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is untrue. Some countries have moratoriums on nuclear power, but their energy production is not necessarily based on renewables and certainly not on the level of renewables that the Liberal Democrats propose. Such countries increasingly base their production on gas, thereby undoing all that we are trying to achieve as regards the geopolitical situation and climate change. That is entirely inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason for a European policy on such issues brings us back to the documents. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, many decisions on energy production and nuclear power in particular are down to economics. At present, short-term economics would lead us to build only gas-fired power stations and I would entirely agree with such a conclusion. If I were to invest my money in energy production, I would do so in gas at the moment, given how we have structured the marketplace and how prices work. I would not invest in renewables, energy conservation, nuclear power or anything other than gas. At the moment, our energy policy seems as though it will be to use all our gas and worry about what comes after when it is gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way we can make people take alternative long-term decisions on the way in which they invest in energy—to encourage them to invest in renewables and, if we go down the suggested route, new nuclear capacity—is to change some of the rules that govern the economics. One change that we and the European Union, with its eye on the single market, should make is for every company involved in energy production to internalise the entire costs involved, including the environmental consequences and the cost of decommissioning. The nuclear industry does so now and there is no reason why the gas, coal and renewables industries should not do so. Every means of energy production has environmental costs, which should be part of the equation so that we can make sensible decisions. We could make that change straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might also have to manipulate the marketplace to allow certain long-term investments to be made now because we see a need for them in the future. One cannot build a nuclear power station overnight. It would take about 15 years, especially given the current planning process, which is rubbish. As has been said, we have a ridiculous planning process under which it takes seven years to build a windmill. I hope that the Government will change that in the near future, but it would still be a year or two before such legislation was in place. Then one would have to go through the new planning process, commission the power station and start building it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that it is disingenuous for anyone to say that they are in favour of keeping the door open on nuclear power, but also to say that nothing should be done until the issue of waste is resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am not declaring an interest, but I will tell him why I am interested in the subject. My research degree was on isotopes in the environment. By training and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
profession, I am a radiation biologist and environmentalist, and I am satisfied with current short-term strategies for handling waste. I have lived by and worked on reactors. I have lived, worked and brought up my family on sites that handle radioisotopes. I have lived in a house that backed on to the railway line of which Greenpeace has been publishing pictures. I used to live next to the yard where the so-called nuclear train was marshalled, and I am perfectly satisfied with current protections in all such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me criticise my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the Government. The time scale for making decisions on waste is far too protracted. A year spent consulting on how we consult before we start talking about options is nonsense. The period of time must be made extremely short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so glad to hear the hon. Gentleman say that. I suspect that the time scale for the DEFRA review is not five years, but seven. We can talk about kicking something into the long grass, but that time scale is nonsense. Two years might be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The technical questions about waste handling and management are no-brainers that any scientist who works in the industry can answer. The important question—a different type of question—concerns where waste management will happen. We should recognise that and move much faster on it. The European Union and Commission can play a role and in so doing help the EU come to a common plan to guarantee our energy supply into the future. It must ensure that we are secure as a union, not overly dependent on those outside the EU, and have a robust and green energy strategy that we can be proud of, for which our children will be thankful and that leaves our country—and the European Union, if we take the collective view—stronger and more prosperous. I hope that Ministers will keep that in mind when negotiating on the future of the documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for South Thanet. He made some valuable points based on his own experience and it always good to find that there is still room in the Labour party for criticism of the Government if they are not moving forward as we believe they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to his point about the Russians having our economy in their hands through their long-term plans. It is part of our responsibility, even while playing a full part in the European Union, to ensure that our economy is in the hands of our Government. I welcome his comment, particularly because of his training, concerning the Government of the Republic of Ireland. I must declare an interest, in that Professor Walton of my alma mater Trinity College Dublin was involved in atomic research in those early days. The tragedy has been that humans regularly misuse the best gifts that God could give us for our own selfish interests and for dastardly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
purposes. That is not to say that nuclear technology cannot be used to the advantage of the human community, both medically and in the power industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something strange about a Government who, over the years, have not been unduly worried about polluting the atmosphere and allowing lead poisoning to take place in Northern Ireland and the Republic and yet are concerned about the potential risk of emissions from Sellafield. In reality, the levels of radiation in the Irish sea are higher than anything that Sellafield might cause. It is ridiculous that, although we are all part of the European Union and are supposed to be trying to move forward together, the Government of the Irish Republic are challenging our Government in the courts to try to stop the development of something that the arguments in this case show is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the hon. Member for Teignbridge has gone. His statement was brisk, but he was developing the not-in-my-back-yard argument, which I, and I trust most of us, deplore completely. He did not want a nuclear power station in Teignbridge, but he did not mind it in East Devon. We must be more consistent in our arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Salisbury spoke about Transco. The Minister will remember that, although I have not yet spoken about it in this sitting, I raised the problem of Pheonix Gas at an early stage. It wants to continue to lay pipelines to parts of Northern Ireland. It has been discovered that when changes including the establishment of Ofgem took place and the different transporters of gas were divided up into different companies, part of the money that should have been divided up among them was not given to Pheonix. Yet private investors continue to pour in their money to develop that source of supply, which will help both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I trust that the Minister will go back to that issue and consider whether something more positive can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like to question the Minister on reserves. It is important that we maintain our reserves. I have been told that the geology of the north Antrim coast, right across to Rockall, is similar to that of Norway and the North sea. Have we not developed the oil fields there because we do not have the money to do so, or because we want to hold the oil in reserve so that when other places dry up we will have the necessary supplies for our industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, I share a political interest in what happens off the west coast and would like to see the development of an oil and gas industry there. The problem is not that there has not been exploration, because there has been, or that people are holding it up, although some would like to veto the whole thing. It is that the returns have not so far been very promising. One discovery has been made off the Hebrides, which I hope will lead to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that comment from the Minister.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Reference has been made to clean coal. I am not too sure whether we can supply clean coal, but I understand that this country has something like 300 years of reserves, while European reserves total only 200 years. Therefore, we have our own hand to play. I join the Committee in welcoming the discussions that are taking place and look forward to the people of this nation benefiting from the supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Building has also been discussed. Why could not architects, with all their wisdom, perceive that when we installed central heating and closed chimney breasts, condensation was inevitable in a climate such as ours? Some of the best brains of our nation could use a little more of their intelligence, not only to encourage us to turn off switches but to ensure that houses and buildings are properly built to satisfy the climatic conditions of the modern world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting, and has shown the complexity of the issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury painted a broad canvas, but referred to many important issues, and the hon. Member for South Thanet made some salient and important points about the safety of nuclear materials and the nuclear industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I pick up on a point made by the hon. Member for Teignbridge, I should declare an interest. In my constituency, apart from pressurised water reactor fuel, we make all the fuel for nuclear power stations in the country, at BNFL's plant at Springfield. We are considering the implications of a wind farm off the Fylde coast. Already, from my front room window, I can see gas extraction in Liverpool bay. Fylde is a positive little Klondike, as it also has some onshore gas, and we are enjoined in all aspects of the energy debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats are confusing in their minds the different challenges of legacy waste from former military and current nuclear power sources with a different waste scenario that would apply to some of the newer designs of nuclear power stations. They would produce infinitely less nuclear waste, which could be stored in dry, on-land conditions as advanced gas-cooled reactor fuel is at present. That would create a wholly different regime from the one that has left the more difficult legacy waste. Any party that tries to have its cake and eat it in terms of energy supply should bring itself up to date with the technologies and relative challenges of that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One word goes to the heart of the discussion—risk. Europe is considering a strategy for energy supply to spread the question of dependency and to open up markets in order to share some of the risks that are involved. The hon. Member for South Thanet was right to mention geo-politics. What would be our defence scenario for the middle east and, indeed, Afghanistan, if we did not have to have one eye over our shoulder on oil and gas supplies in those regions? We could dramatically change our geo-politics, our sense of security and our whole defence policy. That underpins the importance of the debate, because it relates to so many issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
I was interested by the paragraph in the summary of the Green Paper, which states:
	<br><q><p>"The European Union's long-term strategy for energy supply security must be geared to ensuring, for the well-being of its citizens and the proper functioning of the economy, the uninterrupted physical availability of energy products on the market, at a price which is affordable for all consumers (private and industrial), while respecting environmental concerns and looking towards sustainable development, as enshrined in the treaty."</p></q>
What a fantastic paragraph—and it might make good energy policy. I was going to ask the Minister to define the Government's energy policy, because the document described a series of positions—about competition in the marketplace, the operation of the pricing structure and the position in Europe. However, the command and control idea, a policy that would allow the Government to pull levers and strings and to make things happen, cannot be implemented in a free, liberalised market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to reflect on why we are debating the European energy review. It was the shock of California that made us realise that the era of limitless supplies of energy was coming to an end. The problem with that statement about Europe's energy needs is that we cannot have our cake and eat it. We cannot have a limitless, totally secure supply of energy at low prices. It certainly cannot happen if, at the same time, we are to respond to the environmental challenges that are also a key factor. We have to find the right balance if that policy is ever to mean anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would we do for energy if we had no gas— perhaps it became politically unavailable—and no European oil. The United Kingdom is sitting pretty; people would say, "We are all right, Jack." We are sitting on a large chunk of coal—we have been reluctant to burn it in ever-increasing quantities because of the CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. We have nuclear technology. If we really looked after our oil and gas reserves in the North sea, we could make them last a little while longer. We are doing a good job with renewables. However, other European countries are not so well placed. That is an important perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Price versus security is also important. One of the reasons why I changed from driving a high consumption diesel-engined car—I changed to that from an even higher consumption petrol-driven car— was that the price of fuel went up. It concentrated my mind as no other signal could have done that Mr. Jack and his family had to reduce their consumption of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that if using renewables meant increasing the price of electricity, it might not be popular. If we are going to have our cake—a clean environment, and meeting our CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> obligations—we will need a Government brave enough to say that there will be a price to pay. We have seen the price of energy come down in real terms, but if Europe is to address the problem it must start a debate so that people know the price that they may have to pay. That is true also of the nuclear industry. The hon. Member for South Thanet spoke about investment in what we would consider to be an expensive source of energy if we took account of the cost of disposing of some of the raw
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
materials. On the other hand, if we want secure energy supplies in our quarter of the globe and if we want CO2 targets to be met, we shall have to bite the bullet—on that and on renewables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tables on page 83 of the Green Paper spell out the projections for oil and gas consumption. The first shows the EU's share of oil and gas as a proportion of total energy consumption. It starts with a figure of 64 per cent. for 1998 and makes a projection for 2030 of 67 per cent. The second shows the projected increases in CO2 emissions set against the 1990 Kyoto base, in which the EU has a projected increase of 5 per cent. by 2010 and 22 per cent. by 2030. The third table shows that the EU's import dependency is forecast to increase from 49 per cent. in 1998 to 71 per cent. by 2030. Those simple statistics made clear what challenges we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe must press forward on renewables. We cannot duck the issue of nuclear power if we do not want to find ourselves 71 per cent. dependent on imported energy, as is projected in the Green Paper. That seems to sum up the whole challenge. While I will not say that the issues of liberalisation of the French electricity market, the German market and the gas market are sideshows—because proper development of the physical interconnections provides us with an opportunity for sharing burdens if there are problems, which is something to be applauded—the real issue is to get to grips with the consumption of energy. If we do not really drive down our consumption we shall be stuck with the inexorable rise in the demand for energy, and the intractable issues involved with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall paint a small picture: if we wanted to burn more coal, but were reluctant to do so because of CO2 considerations, a way round the problem would be to reduce energy consumption, so that within the total we could afford to burn coal while achieving our environmental output. That would be a very secure position for the United Kingdom, but we are a long way off it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to consider transport, as there has been virtually no serious development. There has been some work on fuel cell cars, but since the internal combustion engine was introduced more than 100 years ago, transport technology has been firmly based on the hydrocarbon cycle. To break out of that, we need to motor on very quickly towards alternative technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister underscored the fact that the Government are re-examining NETA and that he knows about some of the problems affecting combined heat and power. A delegation from British Sugar was in my office yesterday. What is happening seems to me a potty way to deal with something that is 89 per cent, efficient in thermal terms. The interaction of NETA and the climate change levy is turning a company like British Sugar away from conducting its activity in an energy-efficient way while helping to sustain a part of British agriculture—sugar production—that is doing reasonably well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
If the Government are keen on a sustainability agenda they should look after rural Britain by maintaining successful farming activities such as sugar beet production, which is dependent on British Sugar's knocking down its energy costs by means of good quality CHP. That is just one example. Bruner Mond in the chemical industry is another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many interconnections, not just relating to energy, but in a wider sense relating to the energy market. In developing a new policy, hopefully in the context of this European debate, the Government must get to grips with some of the big issues that I have identified. If they think only about the short term, they are in grave danger of losing some of the long-term benefits that we crave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having recovered my breath I apologise for my earlier hesitant start to the debate. There was some confusion about the Room in which it was to be held and I had to make a rapid dash, so I was grateful for the Committee's sympathy. I put it no more strongly than that. One thing that I have learned from today's proceedings is that I must do something about my personal fitness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a good debate and a relatively non-partisan one. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I see the hon. Member for Teignbridge laughing, but he must expect that. I am sure that the prospect of the hon. Member for Salisbury appearing on the streets of Teignbridge and passing among the people distributing tracts filled him with alarm and that he will review his attitudes henceforth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have welcomed the Green Paper because the consultation process that it initiated in Brussels and in the UK will help to develop a shared vision of European security of supply for the future. It is timely, because we were engaged in that debate about security of supply anyway. The energy review had been contemplated before the events in California. It is trite to draw close parallels with what happened there, but it is a useful reminder that in the most prosperous state in the most prosperous country in the world, the lights went out. Security of supply is not guaranteed unless the necessary action is taken. We must tackle the supply and demand balance, while seeking to minimise potential risks of dependence and meeting environmental objectives. The flow of debate today has shown the challenge of getting that combination right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all share roughly the same analysis, even if we do not come to the same conclusions. We shall be dependent on rising imports, largely from outside the EU. The future of nuclear power is a key choice and there is an obvious difference of opinion about it. As I said, in the past few months we have at least stimulated the debate in an intelligent fashion that has been avoided for far too long. By asking the question, we have liberated the arguments and choices that have to be made. The idea that nuclear power could be allowed to fade away in a conspiracy of silence has been discredited and the debate is now taking place. We also agree on the role of renewables, however we quantify

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
it, and on the contribution that energy efficiency could make, which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke) properly brought into the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall digress slightly for a minute or two. I was delighted to hear that the hon. Member for Salisbury spent his early days reading the 	<i>West Highland Free Press,</i> although I regard it as failed missionary work in that he grew up to be a Tory. I balance that by saying that he is a relatively humane Tory, so I suppose that there was some success. He might remember a long-running but unsuccessful campaign about the connection of the Outer Hebrides to the national grid about 20 years ago. That involved putting unsightly pylons through some of the most beautiful landscapes in the west highlands and Skye and a sub-sea cable to the Western Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember arguing over a long period at the time that that was the ideal opportunity to develop renewables in the Western Isles, with the then back-up of diesel power stations. Twenty years ago, we could have developed wave power, wind power and further hydro power in those islands. Sadly, in those dark days, an unenlightened Government were in power who did nothing to encourage such concepts and it was easier to run pylons through the countryside, so we lost 20 years on renewables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am serious about renewables. I take the stricture about quantities, but we had the lead on wind power worldwide 20 years ago, with a company that was the leader in that field. We lost that and it passed to Denmark. Anyone who thinks that renewables are about beards and sandals and the odd windmill on a hill should recognise that Denmark now has a worldwide wind-power industry worth £4 billion a year. That is big business. One reason why I genuinely support renewables is that they are capable of producing not only electricity, but jobs in places that have the natural resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want renewables to be pitted against anything else. That is not the subject of debate, as they will not replace any other form of generation. However, we want to maximise advantages in, for instance, wave power. We lead the world in wave-power technology, with the only commercial wave-power station in the world in operation on Islay. We must ensure that we keep that lead and end up with the £4 billion industry exporting our wave and developing tidal technology to the many places in the world for which nuclear and gas are not options, but which will need generation from renewable sources. I spoke of the hon. Gentleman's early exposure to such sensible views, which has not been entirely lost on him. I recommend continued instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to competitive markets, here and in Europe, and to continuing efforts to complete European Union liberalisation. I think that I deserved some modest praise for the openness of the letter to Lord Brabazon of Tara, from which the hon. Member for Salisbury quoted. That letter openly sets out our position and views and is the sort of document that can be quoted against the author, although I have no complaints about the way in which the hon. Gentleman presented it.

A delay of a year or two is acceptable against the alternatives, because we cannot instruct others to sign up. We can only continue to negotiate and use the levers at our disposal. We may reach our target a year or two behind schedule, but that is better than not getting there at all and, if we were simply engaged in megaphone diplomacy, that would be the realistic alternative. However, it is worth pointing out that qualified majority voting applies in this matter, so the ability to apply pressure exists. A delay of a further year or two is not desirable, but it may be acceptable as an alternative to deadlock, which is what we might otherwise have.

On specific points, the hon. Member for Salisbury asked about the north Yorkshire line. In that case, a planning issue caused the delay, but the line is being built and will ease the England-Scotland flow. As for NETA, the long-term market is slow to develop and the first winter will help to give experience. We recognise the problems, as well as the successes, that have arisen from NETA, and they are being examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the final point made by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) about combined heat and power, I do not deny the problem as I know about the British Sugar and Slough examples and about the investment decisions that have been delayed or reversed as a result of a change in the market for CHP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three factors are involved, which we are addressing. First, I drew attention to what the Chancellor said yesterday in his pre-Budget statement on the climate change levy. That may fall short of what some people ideally wanted, but it at least provides a pointer in the right direction and involves a recognition of the problems, so I am sure that they will be fairly pleased with the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should remember that NETA has only been operative for a few months. If NETA is working against our stated objectives, we cannot do much better than to consult on the impact at this stage, with a view to discovering what we can do about it, albeit against the constraints with the independence of the regulator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it is only fair to take up the point made by the right hon. Gentleman, who referred to the price of gas. That has been one of the big problems for CHP and, as I said, we are trying to get to the bottom of the matter. However, the situation is out of our direct control to a large extent. My message to the CHP industry is that no one thinks that it is crying wolf. There is a real problem and we are trying to deal with it. I regard that as a personal obligation because I have heard about it at first hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fair enough—the matter is not in Ofgem's hands alone. Given the independence of the regulator, the process by which we achieve a synthesis of views after consultation on the effects of NETA and make progress is ill defined. Ofgem is not being obstructive: it rightly highlights the other

consequences of NETA and properly asks how we should make our declared objectives compatible given that they may run counter to NETA. Genuinely interesting work is being done on that. Ofgem and NETA are in their early stages and we must find out how matters can be dealt with in as consensual a way as possible.

Hon. Members mentioned buildings, which I discussed last night with my Belgian counterpart. The Belgians hope that progress will be made on the issue under their presidency of the EU and we are working with them on the buildings directive. We are aware of the need to get the details right and to avoid the problems of poor design and condensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Belgian Minister and I spoke about all sorts of other interesting things, including boilers. As it stands, the directive calls for the regular inspection of boilers. That has given rise to concerns about headlines in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> about boiler snoops descending in their thousands on people's homes, so we are trying to tone down the boiler problem. We hope that the Council meeting in December will make progress on the energy efficiency of buildings.

My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet rightly mentioned geopolitical issues in the context of gas. We must consider where gas will come from. Much of it will come from Norway, but our sources will also include Russia, parts of the former Soviet Union around the Caspian Sea, Algeria, Egypt and eventually Iran. My hon. Friend's comments on all those had a degree of validity. We are not basing our policy only on Russia. The EU should think
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
coherently about all its sources of gas, not only Russia. It should take account of the market conditions that my hon. Friend visualised. We must ask ourselves— this is part of the reason why we need an energy review—to what extent we should become dependent on such sources of gas. That is important not only in terms of our increasing dependence on gas but for our whole economy. That is part of the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons why the review and our debate are necessary. Nuclear energy is in decline and accounts for 25 per cent. of supplies. We shall become a net importer of gas in a few years, although we hope to extend that period. North sea oil production is slowing, although we hope that we can reduce the pace of decline. We are becoming more dependent on gas imports and I mentioned the projected figures. At the same time, we have Kyoto obligations, which inevitably raise the role of renewables. That dramatic and unique combination of circumstances justifies the energy review, but it will not be the end of the debate, only an intermediate point. I am sure that we shall have many more discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That this Committee takes note of European Union documents Nos. 5619/01, the Commission Green Paper, Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply, and 7218/01, relating to common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas; and supports the Government's welcome of both these documents as the Green Paper provides analysis of the energy supply situation and the proposed Directive and Regulation would increase competition in the internal energy market and facilitate cross-border trading in electricity and thereby contribute to security of supply.</p></q></p>
