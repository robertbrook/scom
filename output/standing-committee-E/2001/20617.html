	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration (Beverley Hughes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will be aware that, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg last week, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary proposed an action plan for European Union member states to step up their commitment to act to strengthen EU borders, fight illegal immigration and people trafficking, and prioritise agreement on asylum measures, leading to a common European asylum policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will also know that the United Kingdom has been at the forefront of calls for such concerted action, which is the only way to address the concerns of the people of Europe on the matter. The priorities will be high on the agenda at the European Council in Seville later this week, which underlines that asylum is increasingly an EU-wide issue, as we have consistently said since the introduction of the treaty of Amsterdam five years ago. We need to co-operate with our EU partners if we are to take collective action to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following that broad introduction, I want to thank the Committees of both Houses for their detailed inquiries into the proposal to establish minimum standards on reception conditions. I welcome the opportunity to discuss it further today. From rereading reports of previous debates on the subject, I know that hon. Members have made a valuable contribution that has informed our negotiating position, and helpfully and constructively raised points that we have taken into consideration and moved forward. The Government especially welcome hon. Members' endorsement of the concept of a common European asylum system, towards which the measure represents one of the first steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that the extraordinary European Council at Tampere in October 1999 reaffirmed our commitment to setting minimum standards required by the treaty of Amsterdam, and in the longer term to establishing a fully comprehensive common approach to the subject. The UK has actively participated in that work. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary demonstrated in Luxembourg, he has consistently pressed for swift completion of the minimum standards package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly update the Committee on our progress on the other elements of the package, and on how far we have fulfilled our commitment under the treaty of Amsterdam. I am pleased to report that Eurodac, the computerised central database of
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
fingerprints, is on schedule to go live in early 2003. That will enable the fingerprints of all asylum seekers to be compared, in order to support the application of the Dublin convention and its replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European refugee fund was established in September 2000 with the aim of supporting and encouraging member states' efforts in receiving, and bearing the consequences of receiving, refugees and displaced persons, and helping to provide for their reception, social and economic integration and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The temporary protection directive was adopted in July. It enables member states collectively to decide to provide short-term protection in response to any mass influx of people fleeing a specific crisis. The directive aims to ensure that temporary protection is granted quickly and promotes a balance of effort between member states in bearing the consequences of any mass influx.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also pleased to tell the Committee that negotiations are under way on the qualification directive and the draft regulation—known as Dublin II—on determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application. The Committee will be aware that negotiations are all but concluded on the draft Council directive before us, which lays down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle around which the draft directive is built is that, regardless of which member state considers their applications, asylum seekers should be able to expect similar treatment and to be guaranteed a dignified standard of living. That has clear benefits for the United Kingdom. In particular, introducing a more level playing field for the living conditions to which asylum seekers are entitled should reduce secondary migration and the disproportionate burden on some member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive gives member states a degree of discretion in achieving minimum standards. For example, it does not impose a formula for calculating the level of financial assistance given to asylum seekers, but places an obligation on member states to provide sufficient assistance to allow asylum seekers a dignified standard of living. Member states can decide exactly what assistance to provide to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive also suggests compromises in areas where member states' practices differ greatly. For example, member states grant access to employment in different circumstances and for different reasons. Some regard work as a significant pull factor, while for others it has been a form of reception condition in itself. That is now changing, and all member states will have to grant asylum applicants access to employment at some point in the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the proposal will enable member states with less well developed reception arrangements to build on and improve conditions. Reception conditions in the UK are broadly at or above the minimum standards proposed in the draft directive, and we do not expect to need to make significant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
changes to our reception procedures to comply with it once it is adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quick agreement is important. Negotiations across the package have not been easy, and deadlines have been missed. On its own, the draft directive will not make all the difference that is necessary, but it will have an enhanced effect when combined with the other directives in the package. We cannot realistically expect to jump to full harmonisation in one go. Member states' practices vary widely, which is why we support the Commission's general approach of introducing minimum standards in the short term and moving towards greater harmonisation of those standards later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft directive tackles asylum seekers' needs in every area. It provides for the provision of information on entitlements, and sets standards for residence, freedom of movement, family unity, education, employment, housing and health care. It also makes provision for those with special needs. It is not open ended, however, and the proposals make it clear that asylum seekers will have responsibilities. Provision is made for member states to withdraw reception conditions if they think that their systems are being abused, and such provision already exists in the UK. That approach is balanced by allowing cases in which reception conditions are withdrawn to be reviewed— again, as in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to maintain our high standards on the treatment of asylum seekers in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, which is going through Parliament. We shall, however, have to make no major legislative changes to comply with the draft directive, because the UK has always been at the higher end of the scale in providing for those in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with those critics who have described the directive as providing for the "lowest common denominator", and who have suggested that harmonisation would be a "race to the bottom", leading to a lowering rather than an improvement in standards. That is not the case. There is no reason why a member state would need to use the new proposals as an excuse to lower standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>4.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have few concluding remarks to make. I was talking about the concern expressed in some quarters that the minimum standards might lead to a "common denominator" approach, which could lead to a reduction of standards in some countries. I do not think for a moment that that will be its effect. The directive makes it clear that the standards set are the minimum and that member states are expected to build on them. In that sense, I do not agree with the argument that raising the floor for standards will of itself lower the ceiling. We have no intention of lowering our standards in those areas where minimum standards are below UK levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The directive will have the overall effect of raising standards throughout the European Union. I know that the matter is already being considered in several member states, which recognise that they will have to make significant provision where before they had made none. That can only be good for asylum applicants who find themselves in those countries. They will not have to consider whether to stay in those countries, which could have seriously disadvantaged them and their families. It will be good also for member states such as the UK. We have relatively high standards of provision and care, which we intend to maintain and improve on, but asylum applicants will not feel disadvantaged, as the same or similar provisions will be made elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will support the Government's efforts to secure agreement on the directive, and that it notes our commitment to make progress on the first step of asylum measures in the time scale envisaged in the treaty of Amsterdam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.43 pm for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and that they should be asked one at a time. There is ample time for hon. Members to ask more than one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Humfrey Malins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Woking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give examples of cases in which the minimum standards might result in changes to the practice of member states? Which countries might change their practices for the better as a result of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already mentioned access to employment. The standards set down in the directive will require some member states to change their practices. Luxembourg and Italy do not allow asylum seekers access to the labour market at any stage of the application, but they will be forced to change that. France allows access to employment only in exceptional circumstances. However, in practice, asylum seekers are not granted permission to work. So, France, too, will have to change its employment procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several examples in the area of support. Greece does not provide all asylum applicants with material reception conditions, as the directive terms them. It allows people to work but does not support them. Under the reception directive, it will have to support them. In Italy, accommodation is not always available to asylum applicants. The reception directive requires all asylum applicants to be provided with some form of accommodation. In Spain, where applicants are not supported for the first two months, there will have to be support from day one. Those are substantial improvements in those countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the example of employment that the Minister gave, is it her understanding that the measures also cover access to voluntary work? One issue that has arisen in Britain is that asylum seekers would like to make a contribution in that way, but understand that they are unable to access even voluntary work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directives do not mention voluntary work per se. They refer to vocational
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
training and include a permissive power for member states to grant asylum seekers access to that. However, voluntary work is not specifically mentioned, so we are told neither one thing nor the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On secondary migration, does the Minister really believe that the new measures will have an effect and, if so, why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directives alone will not stop secondary migration, because applicants move from one country to another in pursuit of an asylum claim for many reasons. The directives relate to matters such as access to employment and the support that is given during the application process. People might want to move for other reasons: to be near family or a more sizeable community of people from the same country of origin, for example. The directives will not necessarily have an impact when applicants' motives are not related to the issues addressed in them. None the less, they are a good start in moving towards harmonisation of such factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that in many instances such factors make a difference. There is evidence that they are significant for some asylum seekers, and in those cases they will have an impact. The directive on reception conditions needs to be seen alongside the other directives that are being introduced. There is greater potential for the package as a whole to have an impact on secondary migration, but the proposed measures are an important first step that gives us a foundation on which to build.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Cairns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On several occasions the documents state that accelerated procedures that apply in other EU countries do not apply here, exempting us from the application of a particular point. Will the Minister tell us what those accelerated procedures in other EU countries amount to and why we do not have them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I remember correctly, that matter is related to situations in some countries where people can be dealt with at a border by means of a fast-track process. We do not have such a system here because our circumstances are different. People do not cross borders to arrive here; they do so in a different way. As my hon. Friend says, that situation does not arise in our system. In any case, the references to a different set of conditions for accelerated procedures in EU states, where they exist, appeared in an earlier draft of the documents and have been removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do we have to wait for Eurodac to come on line in 2003 or the Dublin II convention to be implemented? Is the Minister not aware that the Dublin convention is a cause of the great burden placed on the United Kingdom in providing adequate standards for would-be refugees? For example, the schooling of unaccompanied refugee children costs my borough £1.5 million extra per annum. Is she sanguine that we can secure an improvement on the Dublin convention? At present, it operates on a pass-the-parcel basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reasonably confident because there is a great deal of momentum not just in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
country but in other European countries for revising and reforming the Dublin convention. Across the board, people in different member states acknowledge and agree that it is not working. We have heard several pronouncements recently from France and other countries that we need to reform that measure and ensure that it works effectively. In so far as there is commitment and motivation, without which we would not get agreement, there is every reason to be optimistic that we will find a way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Minister's helpful response to my earlier question, will she consider encouraging our negotiators in the final stages to explore whether a lower minimum standard might be introduced to allow people access to voluntary work, perhaps after six months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take some advice on that and write to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Barrett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister believe that the equalising of minimum standards will reduce secondary migration within the EU? Will there be pressure to reduce minimum standards when enlargement of the EU is discussed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Everybody has agreed on the minimum standards in the directive. They are the result of negotiation and some commentators already feel that undesirable compromises were made on one or two of them. The pressure is not to reduce the standards further but rather to use them as a foundation on which to raise standards and harmonise more closely the reception conditions in the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 16 deals with the difficult issue of how to discourage people from breaching the terms under which they are temporarily housed while awaiting a decision. Article 16(3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall under all circumstances ensure access to emergency health care."</p></blockquote>
On the other hand, article 15, which deals with general health care, refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary health care which shall include, at least, emergency care and essential treatment of illness."</p></blockquote>
Taken together, that means that article 16 allows member states to withdraw care for essential treatment of illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give an example of the distinction made between emergency health care and "essential treatment for illness"? I imagine that emergency health care would refer to the sort of incident in which someone was knocked down by a bus, when we would not refuse to treat them. Presumably, chemotherapy treatment for cancer would qualify as ongoing, essential health care. Does the Minister agree that there would be widespread concern if member states penalised applicants for breaching a condition by, for example, withdrawing chemotherapy for cancer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and perceptive to point out that there is a difference between the minimum standard of health care set down by the directive under the titles "Health care" and "Reduction or withdrawal of reception conditions". I accept that the term "essential

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
treatment" will inevitably enable a degree of interpretation and discretion and that the interpretation may vary in different member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is potential for variance in essential medical treatment, but emergency health care will always be provided. As a result of the negotiations that have taken place so far, it has been accepted that if a medical practitioner validates that treatment is essential, the member state must provide that essential treatment. There will be a rubric over the opinion of the medical practitioner; the matter will not be decided in a non-medical or arbitrary fashion so that a member state can simply deny treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scrutiny Committee's report has a conclusion in paragraph 3·10, which opens with the sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot share the Government's optimism about this draft Directive."</p></blockquote>
Given the in-built Government majority on the Committee, that is condemnation indeed. However, I shall try to share the Government's optimism for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In aiming to create a level playing field throughout the European Union, what assessment has the Home Office made, in numerical terms or percentages, of the likely dispersal of new asylum seekers across the EU? Does the Minister anticipate that those seeking entry into the United Kingdom will decrease in preference to other member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the United Kingdom experiences a substantial effect from secondary migration, and subject to the qualifications that I have already set out—that the directive will not have total impact until other directives have come on-line and Dublin II has been negotiated—we expect the measures to have considerable impact. I cannot translate that into actual numbers at this point, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have received estimates, that we shall monitor asylum applications carefully and make some judgment about the impact of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the helpful answers that the Minister has given so far, but I am suffering from an information vacuum. We have few statistics from other member states on the provision that they make for accommodation, benefits and employment levels among asylum seekers. Will my hon. Friend the Minister undertake to acquire some figures that would provide us with a measure on which we could base our judgments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with what my hon. Friend says. I have held this brief for a relatively short time, and I, too, have been unable to get my head around the variance and detail of asylum application arrangements in all EU member states, but as I shall have to do that, I will be happy to share such information with the Committee. On the impact of these measures, towards the end of the document, it states that the Commission will evaluate and report on the directive—after the first year, if I remember correctly. I may be wrong about that, but there will certainly be an evaluation at Commission level, and the Committee will have access to that report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that, in the UK, an asylum seeker cannot take up employment for six months. When the matter was debated in the European Parliament, Labour Members of the European Parliament supported an amendment that would reduce the period to four months. Do the Government side with their MEPs on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is this Government who will decide those issues for the country, not Members of the European Parliament. In formulating the directive's conditions, employment was one of the most difficult matters for negotiation between member states in the working groups. That is because employment has played a different role in the arrangements of various member states. For example, Greece allows people to work immediately, but as an alternative to giving them any support. In the UK, the possibility of employment is a pull factor in attracting people here, which is why we do not want to allow people to work at an early stage in their application. Were we to allow them to do so, that may attract even more people to come here for economic reasons. Therefore, we were happy with a compromise. We would have been happy with a condition that allowed people to work at six months, because that is the position here. We do not want to reduce that period at the moment and, clearly, as the directive is drafted, the current rules in the UK can continue to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a perception that Britain is a target for secondary migration, but it is, perhaps, overstated, because the whole of the European Union is, relatively, much better off than some poor parts of the world. If people must flee from their own countries, it is understandable that they want to go somewhere more secure in every sense. Given that levels of unemployment and benefit tend to be much higher on the continent of Europe, especially in the eurozone, than in Britain, will the measures help to ensure that asylum seekers will be sustained at a civilised and decent level in the eurozone nations, whether by employment or by benefits, so that they will not necessarily be so keen to come to Britain but will stay in other countries, once there is more equal treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has explained the situation clearly. In harmonising conditions relating to employment and benefits in European countries, the intention of the directive is twofold. It will ensure that we have minimum standards that reflect common notions of decency and allow people to be sustained in a decent manner while their applications are considered. Secondly, to deal with the point about harmonisation, the draft directive seeks to reduce people's perception that conditions will be better if they travel to another country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) and the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), the Minister referred to the mass phenomenon of secondary migration. Is not that phenomenon, ipso facto, a breach of the Dublin convention? Why have Her Majesty's Government not taken to the European Court the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Conservative Government concluded the long negotiations on the Dublin convention. France is the most prominent country in our minds when it comes to secondary migration, but a Conservative Home Secretary tore up the gentlemen's agreement that preceded the Dublin convention. If that bilateral agreement were in place now, we would have something to build on. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sure that the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) tore up the gentlemen's agreement with France when the Dublin convention was agreed. The hon. Gentleman cannot hold up the Conservative Government's record on ensuring that we had a workable system, and we shall certainly not seek to emulate it as we negotiate Dublin II, the alternative to the Dublin convention. We shall seek to achieve something that works much better than anything the Conservative Government introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a time when more Europhobe members of the public and Members of Parliament opposed a common European policy on immigration, but those reservations have vanished as xenophobia has overtaken Europhobia. Does the Minister agree that there is now a pretty broad consensus that it would be good to move on from the directive and to take steps towards common immigration and asylum policies throughout the European Union to avoid the problems about which we have heard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I should remind the Committee that we are talking about the reception of asylum seekers, not about a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear that in mind, Mr. Atkinson, although my hon. Friend is right. The UK and one or two other countries have pushed for common European asylum policies and procedures. The time for such measures has come, and support has been gathering momentum. We need the other directives, the implementation of Eurodac and the proposals dealt with by the Home Secretary in Luxembourg, which will be discussed further in Seville this week. Those are all important elements in establishing the common European asylum policy and procedures that every European Union country needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the Minister right and ask her to accept that the last Conservative Government did not tear up any agreement? My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe and Timothy Kirkhope, who is now an MEP, negotiated the agreement. It was a bilateral agreement, not a gentlemen's agreement, and it lapsed. It was not torn up. The Government have had five years to deal with the issue, so why have they not renegotiated the agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to persist with the note of discord introduced by the hon. Gentleman. However, I felt it necessary to correct his impression. As I recall, the Conservative Government allowed the first paragraphs of the Dublin convention to agree to the dismantling of the bilateral agreement—the so-called gentlemen's agreement—that the UK had with France. The fact that that agreement was dismantled—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It lapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was dismantled by agreement of the then Conservative Government within the terms of the Dublin convention to which they agreed. Because that bilateral agreement was dismantled, it has been difficult until recently to get France to the point of replacing it. However, France is now talking positively with us and I am sure that the negotiations between my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the French Interior Minister will be productive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the admirable work already done in setting appropriate standards for the reception of would-be refugees by the Council of Europe? Would that not be a better forum in which to evolve an appropriate policy, in that it has 44 member nations, many of them countries from which would-be asylum seekers originate? Is she pleased that the United Kingdom's practices in the field, which have always been commendable, should be dictated by the European Union, since this country has been, candidly, a model in fulfilling our obligations under the UN convention on refugees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the forum, we are where we are. We are members of the EU, which is working hard to set common standards in various aspects of asylum procedure and policy. Therefore, that is the forum in which the standards are being discussed. I have never understood the view expressed by some Conservative Members that our membership of the EU, by definition, involves our being dictated to. This is an excellent example—as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged—of the way in which the UK's handling of matters has been a model that has influenced the conclusions coming from the process and the standards that are contained in the directive. As I have outlined in some detail, those require other member states to change their practices in some of the most significant areas of employment and support. Far from being dictated to by other European countries, we are leading the change and improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's answer seems apposite. Does she agree that if standards are, as far as possible, equalised across the EU, the propensity of asylum seekers to migrate to another country within the EU will lessen? Is that not likely to diminish the difficulties that are experienced, particularly in Britain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Not only have we led the process, but the way in which arrangements are made here has influenced the outcome of the work that has gone into producing the directive. That clearly benefits the United Kingdom to a significant extent, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
that we experience a high level of secondary migration, which the directive is designed to reduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify a response that her predecessor, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), gave to the Scrutiny Committee? Paragraph 3·6 of the Scrutiny Committee's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we have twice asked the Minister how the UK is able to honour its international obligations if it allows food and housing support to be withdrawn, even if only in certain circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The then Minister's reply, in reference to the Asylum Support Regulations 2000, was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a centre resident breaches his or her conditions of residence, they may be required to leave the centre … In some cases where conditions have been breached the person may be detained".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister give us some clue as to what she thinks the effect of that will be on the numbers of asylum seekers who are not detained, but who disappear into the general populace? Will we lose touch with those people, or does she have another proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The directive does not address that issue, so I shall reply cautiously, Mr. Atkinson. No doubt you will stop me if I go beyond the scope of the debate. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that the proposals in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill to change our procedures are based on the important assumption that, to make our processes work better, we need to keep in contact with people throughout the course of their application. That will involve induction at the point of making an application; ensuring that we know where people are in accommodation centres or dispersed accommodation; and ensuring that people keep telling us where they are, with ourselves monitoring that. If a decision has been made to accept a person, they should be integrated as quickly as possible into the community. If there is a refusal, the appeal process should be gone through—again, maintaining contact and knowing where people are—so that the person concerned can be removed if the appeal is not upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new measures are designed specifically to minimise the circumstance that the hon. Gentleman outlined, which was that people could simply disappear. Part of the reason for the proposal of accommodation centres—they are referred to in the directive and other member states have them—is very much to explore whether that method of housing people during an application is a better way to reduce the number of people who disappear, given that we can keep in contact with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to article 2(d)(i) and (ii) on the definition of "family members", as I would like some clarification. What is the present situation in the UK for an application by an unmarried partner in a so-called stable relationship? What about children of such a relationship born out of wedlock? Would such people have equal rights to asylum in the UK as married people and the children of marriages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Potentially, they have the same right, provided that they can demonstrate that the relationship is stable and has subsisted for some time,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and that the people have been living together as a married couple would do, albeit that they have not gone through a marriage ceremony.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further on that? The couples come from many places such as Afghanistan, Somalia, the Congo and Yemen, which by their nature—in their current tragic circumstances—are turbulent, to say the least. How can such relationships be proven to be stable? How can we prevent the immigration of adopted children of such unions, given that we all know that, on the subcontinent, the adoption concept can be fairly widely interpreted? For example, will DNA methods be used in that second case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The casework staff of the immigration and nationality directorate who make such decisions are very experienced. They will base their findings on interviews—they are experienced in putting such questions—and on the evidence of people's previous residency and so on. The IND has well-established procedures for making judgments on whether such relationships exist. DNA testing may help in taking some of the decisions about adopted children to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but I am not sure that it will often be feasible. However, we are still considering those matters; if we make any progress, I shall be glad to write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled by the last sentence of article 5(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (2) instructs member states to ensure that applicants are informed of their rights in writing in a language that they can reasonably be supposed to understand. It ends with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where appropriate this information may also be supplied orally."</p></blockquote>
It would be strange if member states were to be forbidden from supplying information orally. I wonder what that means. It is not a purely frivolous question, but I imagine that some applicants may not be too literate and may not be able to understand their legal rights in the jargon sometimes used in such documents. It may sometimes be important for applicants to be informed orally. I wonder whether the "may" in that last sentence ought to be "should".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that what is written down may need to be explained orally to a number of people to ensure that they really understand. Article 5 is about ensuring that people understand the information, not simply that they have been handed a piece of paper. The word "may" is acceptable because it is conditional; it is permissive because not every person will need such an explanation. It is fair that the process should allow for oral explanation if it is thought necessary to ensure understanding. That is the key.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to article 7 on residence and freedom of movement. How can the right of asylum seekers to move freely within the territory of the host member state be compatible with being corralled into an area assigned to them by the member state? What is the Government's view on that? Will asylum seekers be able to move freely within a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
certain radius of a reception centre, or shall we see here the same state of affairs that exists in Sangatte, where residents normally stay for a maximum of a month? The turnover there is such that, after a month, asylum seekers have normally got on a train through the channel tunnel because they still have freedom of movement. Will asylum seekers in this country be assigned to a designated area, or will they have total freedom of movement throughout the United Kingdom so long as they come back to bed at the reception centre?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is talking specifically about accommodation centres, but when somebody is housed either in dispersed housing or accommodation centres, they are given a place to which they need to return to sleep. We will expect people in the accommodation centres, by and large, to come back to the centre in the evening. We have already made it clear that, short of that, people will have freedom to go in and out of accommodation centres. Subject to limitations on how far they can travel and, as with all of us, the means that they have to pay for travel, they will be free to go to other places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the article is inconsistent with what we envisage for people residing in accommodation centres or dispersed housing. It was drafted to reflect an example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey, the then Minister, in another Committee. Her point concerned the practice in Germany, where the lander, rather than the Government, allocate housing to asylum seekers. In Germany, there is a restriction, in that asylum seekers are within the purview of regional rather than central Government and the drafting needed to accommodate that particular national circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are no more questions, we will move to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 8351/02, draft Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States; supports the Government's efforts to secure agreement on a Council Directive for reception conditions for asylum applicants which will promote a balance in the provision of reception arrangements throughout the Union; and notes the Government's commitment to secure agreement to the asylum measures within the time period envisaged by the Treaty of Amsterdam.—[	<i>Beverley Hughes.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to make a few remarks, which will probably lack any shape or theme. They certainly will not be memorable and, in view of the heat and general humidity, I hope that they will not be too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all scratch our heads at finding ourselves here on a very hot Monday afternoon to debate a directive to which none of us has contributed; at least I have not, and I have some interest in asylum matters. It is an odd state of affairs when matters that are binding on this country are decided elsewhere whether we say that we like them today or not, especially when our own standards are pretty high. That is what I feel,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
given that I do not feel the need to decide what standards apply in other EU countries. Personally, I think that it is a matter for them. I am a great bilateral man when it comes to agreements, and not a great centralist. I have got that off my chest; it had been boiling up for several minutes. I shall move on to a few—I hope not rambling—questions about these interesting provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glad as I am of the support of my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood, for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and for Henley (Mr. Johnson) today, I shall focus briefly on a question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. He talked about the spouse of an asylum seeker or his or her unmarried partner in a stable relationship. As we know, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, which we have just considered in Committee and which has just had its Third Reading, makes no reference to an unmarried partner of either sex in a stable relationship. There is no such definition. Clause 26 talks about how, if somebody misbehaves in an asylum centre, they and their spouse or dependent can be thrown out. Does the Minister envisage that an unmarried partner of either sex in a stable or not-so-stable relationship would be among those who could be thrown out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see, we do a lot better out of article 5 than out of anything else in the regulations. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member states shall inform applicants for asylum within a reasonable time not exceeding fifteen days … of … any established benefits and of the obligations with which they must comply … Member States shall ensure that applicants are provided with information about organisations or groups of persons that provide specific legal assistance".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that she expects the UK to do that much sooner? We never had a real debate about the so-called induction centres on Report. I drafted skilful amendments on the measures concerning those centres on Report, but yet again they were not reached. The Government envisage that people will spend up to 14 days in the induction centres. Does the Minister think that there is a prospect that they might spend much less time than that in those centres?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first few days of an application for asylum are the most critical in terms of the availability of legal and medical advice and the provision of a full explanation to an asylum seeker. Will the Minister ensure that we do better than article 5 requires us to do by providing all the information and legal help at the earliest possible stage; preferably within a day or so of somebody arriving at an induction centre rather than an accommodation centre?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister happy about article 7, which says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Applicants for asylum may move freely within the territory of the host Member State"?</p></blockquote>
Let us consider our accommodation centres. I appreciate that provision has been made that people should be in an accommodation centre but, importantly, article 7(2) says that we can decide on the residence of the applicants for reasons of public order, public interest or the swift processing of claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I can envisage a legal challenge coming from a resident of an accommodation centre who decides to push off for four or five weeks. The accommodation centre manager might not like that, and might tell the applicant that he has to go, that his benefits will be cut and so on. The applicant may ask why he has to stay in the centre, and might be told that it is in the public interest that he does so. He could reply that it would not be in the public interest, as he could live with some chums in London or visit his best friends and come back in a month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manager might then say that it was in the interests of public order that the applicant stay in the centre; this will be difficult for 	<i>Hansard</i> because I am having an imaginary conversation. The applicant might answer that the decision had nothing to do with public order because he was behaving perfectly properly. The manager could reply that the applicant's stay was to do with the swift processing and effective monitoring of his application. The applicant might say that it was not, as he had just made his application and all his paperwork was in order; and that as he was expecting no result for a month, he would be off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister troubled by article 7, or the legal challenges that might be made under it? Article 7(5) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The applicant shall not require permission to keep appointments with authorities and courts".</p></blockquote>
Can she confirm that that provision also relates to keeping appointments with lawyers and the like? I should not want anyone to put a block on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister entirely happy with how article 10 on education reads? I notice that it includes the sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such education may be provided in accommodation centres."</p></blockquote>
Can she confirm that that provision was included because of the British Government? I do not think that the phrase "accommodation centres" operates in many other countries. The provision is a rather neat way of getting round the Government's problem with their Back Benchers and the fight that the two nearly had in the Chamber the other night on whether education should be provided on or off-site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 says that the education for children of applicants shall be
	<br><blockquote><p>"under similar conditions as nationals of the host Member State".</p></blockquote>
What does "under similar conditions" mean? Is the Minister saying that some youngster being educated on-site, perhaps by specialist teachers in language, is being taught in similar conditions to nationals of the host state? The conditions are not similar; they are wholly different. The child is in a different place and has a different type of education; he has a different type of social intercourse—not a phrase that I like, but I could not think of a better one—and mixes with other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with the question of the labour market and asked the Minister whether she supported her MEPs, who take the view that, after four months, applicants should be entitled to do some paid work. She has not answered that, but I hope that she will deal with the point. Is the period of four months right? Or will the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Government say, "No. Our MEPs are wrong on that point"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 14 refers to the provision of housing in
	<br><blockquote><p>"private houses, flats, hotels, or other premises adapted for housing applicants".</p></blockquote>
The Minister will remember that we tabled a new clause when discussing the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill on Report that would enforce proper standards of housing for asylum seekers. Discussion about that was never reached in the debate. We were worried about slum landlords and the possibility of asylum seekers being housed in conditions that would not be regarded as satisfactory in this country. I look forward to receiving a response from the Minister about that new clause and the adequacy or otherwise of such housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 of article 14 refers to legal advisors being granted access to reception centres. I do not understand the meaning of "reception centre". It has no place under our law. We do not have reception centres. What is a reception centre? We have induction centres and accommodation centres. Will the Minister confirm that the power means that legal advisors will have full access to induction centres? Will the Minister confirm that if people are to spend 14 days at induction centres—the Bill permits that—legal advice will be present on-site at the induction centre, so that its full benefit can be obtained early?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister think that my proposition makes our position compatible with that of the EU directive? I think that the Home Secretary said that if an asylum seeker breaches conditions of residence in this country, his asylum application would be materially affected by the breach, and that that would have an effect on his credibility. That is a critical point. There is a parallel to be drawn under the criminal law. If you were put on bail—well, you would not be put on bail, Mr. Atkinson; you would be remanded in custody. 	<i>[Laughter.] </i> I apologise.

Let us suppose that I were put on bail under the criminal law, and a bail condition was to live in a hostel. If that were breached, there is no question of one's merits at the trial being affected. That is not even mentioned. Why should it be? It is separate matter, and I would be charged with a bail offence. It would not be held against a person if he had broken the bail hostel condition. I do not want someone who, for example, is guilty of some footling breach of a condition in respect of an accommodation centre finding that he will then be threatened with the fact that an adverse inference will be drawn about his asylum application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude as I began; by saying that it should also be of concern to members of the Committee that such an important document cannot be changed. It is a pity that our system does not permit a Select Committee, a Special Standing Committee or a Back-Bench Committee to discuss such matters well before they reach this Committee. We are presented with a fait accompli. We can ask a few questions; we can raise a few points. A few of our questions are answered, but we cannot change matters. In terms of the services that we provide for asylum seekers, this country treats them

very well. That is only right and proper. If, as a result of the directive, other countries do better, that is all to the good. For that reason, the Opposition remain somewhere between neutral and positive about the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the quite liberal tones of the hon. Member for Woking. I was surprised when he suggested at the end of his remarks that there had not been a chance properly to address the matter in this Parliament. I refer him to the Scrutiny Committee's report, which notes that the Committee was considering the proposal for the sixth time. How many times does the Committee have to consider the matter before he feels that it has been consulted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have been more accurate and said that what depresses me is that there are not more chances for the relevant Select Committee—in this case the Home Affairs Committee—to examine those areas and take evidence over months and months. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and he will therefore probably understand mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make three points, some of which were explored in a previous discussion, on the specifics of the draft directive. To follow up on my earlier exchange with the Minister, I accept her point on article 5(2), which deals with whether information should be supplied orally. In response to my question, she said that it would be desirable for information to be supplied orally where that was appropriate, but that that would not always be necessary because some applicants would be able to read and understand such information without further explanation. The last sentence of article 5(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where appropriate this information may also be supplied orally."</p></blockquote>
The precise meaning of the sentence is that there will be occasions on which the supply of information would be appropriate but such information will not be supplied, which is why I feel that it would be better if the sentence were to state, "Where appropriate this information should also be supplied orally." I am sorry to appear to be splitting hairs, but it would be helpful to raise that issue in the final drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 16(3) relates to our discussion of emergency health care—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Due to a problem with the sound recording equipment, I must suspend the Committee for a few moments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>6.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the interruption. It appears at least that we have moved to a cooler Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my inflammatory remarks burned out the recording machine. I shall try to tone them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that I very much agree with the Minister that when a GP specifies that essential medical treatment is needed, treatment should be given even in situations in which a breach of the asylum application conditions has taken place. I am not a legal expert, but my reading of the directive is that it does not require that treatment be given. It is significant that there is a difference in wording between articles 15 and 16. Article 15 specifies that essential treatment of illness shall be given to applicants, but the phrase is left out of article 16. That suggests that certain member states may wish to reserve the power to refuse essential medical treatment to applicants who have breached their conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is about the Government's response to questions from the parent Committee on whether the directive might violate the European convention on human rights. The response states, inter alia:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Withdrawal of support may engage ECHR Article 3 in some circumstances, however, we do not consider that destitution alone reaches the threshold required to be reached before Article 3 is engaged."</p></blockquote>
I find that sentence slightly chilling. It appears to say that people may become destitute because of withdrawal of support under article 16, but that that is okay because it does not violate the ECHR. I am not sure whether even among people who are somewhat sceptical about asylum seekers, there would be widespread support for the view that people should be allowed to become entirely destitute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two points about minimum standards worry me. If this or some future British Government were to introduce proposals that would deny essential medical treatment to asylum seekers who breached the terms of their applications or would allow them to become entirely destitute, I would not support them. I hope that the Government will press further to try to persuade our partners in the European Union to agree to stronger minimum standards in those two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we all accept that some measure is needed to prevent people from wilfully breaching the terms under which their asylum application is being considered. I personally feel that detention in such situations is probably a more appropriate sanction— obviously, there is room for debate on that—but denying essential health care or leaving the applicant destitute are inappropriate responses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be out of political fashion— indeed, I am not a follower of fashion in any real sense—but, on political matters, I believe that one should do what one regards as sensible and not necessarily what is fashionable. I am unfashionable, in that I have a predisposition to accept that regulation is necessary. I am not always sympathetic to the headlong flight towards deregulation, especially if the regulation is rational, sensible, necessary and fair. That is why, by and large, we should support the directive and why I am glad that the Government do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The details are of concern, particularly to the Select Committee, which is why it has referred the matter to the Scrutiny Committee. Without much more information, I find it difficult to make many precise judgments on the proposal. However, I am concerned about whether the different member states will adhere to the directive as and when it comes into force, because this Committee has observed on a number of occasions that different states have different degrees of enthusiasm for enforcing directives, regulations and other EU law. I hope that this directive will be adhered to equally by all member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is necessary because the different states have different standards, and we want to make those standards not only the same throughout the EU, but fair. They seem likely to benefit asylum seekers, in that they will guarantee a reasonable, civilised and humane reception in all countries. The difference in how asylum seekers are received may be a factor in secondary migration within the EU. One wants above all to end that difference in treatment, because it means not only that asylum seekers feel obliged to move from one country to another—with more disruption to themselves and others—but that there are tensions between member states. None of us wants that, and the fact that there has been tension between France and Britain on this matter may be related to differences between how asylum seekers are received in these countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hopes that, over time, these minimum standards, and the gradual move towards harmonisation mentioned by my hon. Friend the Minister, will lead to a situation in which asylum seekers do not choose to hop from one country to another within the EU. That is particularly important to the UK because we are at least perceived to be a target of secondary migration. The alarmist media may exaggerate that, but it is possible that we provide better standards for asylum seekers than other member states do. We must ensure that other member states at least reach our standards and that, in time, we all move to a standard that we can all accept as civilised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, I strongly support the proposal, but the Select Committee has raised concerns that have been brought to this Committee for scrutiny. I am not completely confident that I can make a good judgment on them, so I shall trust that the Minister has taken full account of the Select Committee's concerns, that we are all in agreement and that further concerns will not be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe referred in passing to Europhobia. I suspect that he is hinting that I am a Europhobe, which I am not. Although I am strongly critical of the EU on economic matters, as many of us are, I strongly support the principle underlying the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure my hon. Friend that I do not believe that he is phobic about anything, except possibly the euro coin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have certain phobias, but they are nothing to do with the EU. I would like to see more regulation on, for example, fishing, which should be tightly regulated within the EU. We should get rid of
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the nonsensical free-for-all that has seen most of the fish disappear from the North sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with Members' points before concluding what has been an interesting debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Woking referred again to stable relationships and non-married partnerships. With regard to asylum applications and any subsequent decisions on withdrawal of conditions as a result of breaches, the partner of the principal applicant who is claiming asylum on the basis of experiences in another country is part of that application. The partner is tied to the applicant's claim whether they are married or unmarried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about information. He has been part of the debate for longer than I have. However, I can tell him that we envisage that people will be at induction centres ideally for short periods, although we have allowed for 14 days in case there are any issues to deal with. We do not envisage that it will be necessary for legal advice to be on-site, because part of the purpose of induction is to give people all the necessary information to ensure that they know what will happen to their application, and to start to get the necessary advice from elsewhere to help them to progress it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to article 7 and gave the scenario of someone who wanted to go away for three or four weeks once their application had been lodged. He asked whether we would anticipate a legal challenge. I refer him to article 7(4), which allows member states to make the provision of material conditions, as we are calling them—in this case, the accommodation—conditional on actual residency in a particular place. In other words, a place in an accommodation centre is conditional upon the person to whom it is given being there. We do not anticipate that that will be contrary to the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned article 10 on accommodation centres. The sentence that refers to education being provided on-site was not just a UK insistence. Several countries have accommodation centres, although the practice varies. In some countries, the education is off-site, but in others—for example, Denmark—it is on-site. Several countries support the possibility for on-site education within the terms of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must have given an unforgettable response to the Conservative party's amendment on standards of housing, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that if he looks in 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that that was raised on Report. I gave him something of a reply but, obviously, it has not burned itself into his memory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all comes back to me. I apologise to the Minister. What I should have said was that that was quite a brief debate, in which we did not cover things in much depth. However, for me to have forgotten the ministerial response is unforgivable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very generous. If he looks in 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I was trying to explain that we have methods and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
mechanisms in the UK for enforcing housing standards. They apply as much to dispersed accommodation and other forms of accommodation for asylum seekers as to other housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the potential to withdraw support for breaching conditions and his concern that a breach might, of itself, influence the process and judgment of an application. I want to assure him, as my ministerial predecessor did in Committee, that we must allow for the possibility that someone's behaviour might be such that it is relevant to an application. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that if, for example, someone committed a serious criminal offence, such as a sexual crime, that would be relevant to the consideration of a claim for asylum. I am not saying that that would have to determine that claim, but it would be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the nature of the behaviour were so serious and contravened the laws of the country, it would have to be set alongside the evidence that a person put forward for their application. Clearly, behaviour such as that which the hon. Gentleman had in mind—arguments among people in an accommodation centre and difficulties of that nature—of course would not and should not be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe for mentioning the final point that the hon. Member for Woking made about feeling rather impotent, if I may use that term, in this process because he has not had an opportunity to influence the content of the UK position and what we have taken to the negotiating table. I said in my opening remarks that responses from the parent Committee in particular, and from other Members, have been influential on the position that we have taken with other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 5(2), I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe about "may", having looked again and seen the words "where appropriate". I shall take that back as a drafting point to see whether there is agreement on changing it. On voluntary work, I can tell my hon. Friend that we intend, in the accommodation centre trials, to encourage interaction between accommodation centre residents and local residents, as I think we have made clear. We envisage that part of that could be voluntary work by asylum seekers. Whether it is quite right to include that in a document setting down minimum standards for all member states is another question, but it is certainly something that we want to develop in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statistics about which I was concerned before were on employment in particular. Will my hon. Friend undertake to try to find out the extent to which asylum seekers work in other member states and make real comparisons between them and us? I am concerned about that and think, personally, that the more asylum seekers can work, the better they
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
will be integrated into the societies to which they have moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly see if I can put together some information to give my hon. Friend a picture of the situation in that regard across member states. I remind him of the comment that I made in my opening remarks; whether employment is a pull factor plays differently in different member states. We must bear that in mind. There will be variants, relating to the different conditions already persisting in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the difference between articles 16 and 15, the feeling from the working groups suggested that anything life threatening—my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe mentioned cancer—should be covered. My hon. Friend is right to point to those differences in standards for health care. We must also recognise that member states need to be able to withdraw support when necessary. I have accepted that there is potential for the term "essential medical treatment" to be interpreted differently when dealing with a situation over and above the threshold relating to things that are life threatening. However, I hope that I can assure my hon. Friend that so far as emergency treatment and anything that threatens life is concerned, all member states are bound to meet the minimum standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the member for Broxtowe also asked about the potential violation of the ECHR. We should not pretend—I would not try to—that people would not be affected by the withdrawal of support. My hon. Friend read out remarks made by my ministerial predecessor and seemed to be saying that the Government did not believe that the extent to which people would be affected would engage article 3 of the document, which relates to the level of destitution. If that were the case in any member state, it could be challenged under the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North clearly set out the aims of the directive in his introductory remarks. The directive will ensure minimum standards that can be built on over time and will harmonise standards to reduce secondary migration and the need for people to feel that they must migrate to yet another country. I can assure him that full account has been taken of Committee members' comments. We are also involved in a process outside Parliament, in which we are negotiating to reach an agreement with other member states; there will be a need for compromise, notwithstanding our having taken careful regard of the views of Members of both Houses of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Committee for an interesting and informative debate. Members have today, as before, raised pertinent and important questions. I shall reply to those hon. Members to whom made I such a commitment. The key questions about the directive are these; how much do we need to harmonise and how far does the directive achieve that? In today's discussion, hon. Members have implicitly—sometimes explicitly— accepted that setting minimum standards and having harmonisation as an objective are worthwhile aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
As regards how far the directive will go, I said at the outset that the proposal is a first step and will require some member states to make significant changes to their current procedures; that will be positive and will raise standards. It is only a first step and will not have a significant effect without the other minimum standard measures that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary called for during a recent sitting of Home Affairs Committee.
