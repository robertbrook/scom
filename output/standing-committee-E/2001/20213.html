	<div class='legislation'>1976 Equal Treatment Directive</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>[Relevant Document: European Union Document No. 14492/01]</i></p>
	<p>4.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Cabinet Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. This is an important debate and a good opportunity to discuss issues arising from the European Commission's proposal to bring up to date the main European Community law on sex equality dating from 1976, the equal treatment directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will realise, from its earlier view of the proceedings, that negotiations on proposals to amend the directive have been going on for some time. I know that the Belgian presidency was disappointed not to be able to conclude the dossier. The Spanish presidency is pressing on with it, and it is now entering the crucial stage of conciliation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equal treatment directive became law in February 1976. It establishes that the principle of equal treatment between men and women means that there should be no direct or indirect discrimination whatsoever on the grounds of sex in the fields covered. Any exceptions to the rule are to be limited. It covers employment and vocational training, and is implemented in the United Kingdom through the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which also covers, but is not limited to, those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1976 the text of the equal treatment directive has proved so broad that it has been open to interpretation. Over the years, substantial case law has built up from the European Court of Justice that assists us in interpreting the directive and finding the approach that should be taken in issues of equal treatment between men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has played an important part in the development of the principle of equal treatment over the years. Several important, leading cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice from our courts. I pay tribute to the Equal Opportunities Commission, which has often been instrumental in that area. It has supported important cases that have clarified the law in such areas as discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and indirect discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached a stage at which the European Parliament, Commission and Council all aim to bring the 1976 equal treatment directive up to date to reflect the changes generated by modifying the original treaty of Rome under the most recent treaty, the treaty of Amsterdam, by many years of case law from the European Court of Justice, to which I have referred and, very importantly, by the need to read across, where appropriate, to the two important directives
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
agreed in 2000 under article 13 on race discrimination and on discrimination in employment on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation, religion and belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through our support for the modernisation of the equal treatment directive, the UK Government hope to ensure that all member states operate the same standard of protection against sex discrimination, which will ensure a level playing field for business and workers across Europe. As far as practicably possible, race and sex discrimination law should be comparable to avoid unnecessary confusion arising from different definitions and standards. However, it is true that gender has unique features, such as pregnancy, associated absences and maternity leave. Also, unlike groups protected under the new directives, women are not a minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7 June 2000, the Commission proposed a directive to amend the equal treatment directive. Following negotiations, the Council's representatives produced a common position, a text to which all member states agreed. The Council adopted it formally on 23 July 2001. We, like other member states, believe that the common position is a balanced text that will strengthen the principle of equal treatment, and its practical implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That text contains a specific text that requires member states actively to take into account equality when making and implementing law and policy—the mainstreaming principles—and includes a definition of sexual harassment, which European and UK case law has already established as a form of sex discrimination. Instructions to discriminate against a third party are also to count as sex discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The text includes a right to return to work after maternity leave. The principle of equal treatment is extended to trade unions, employers' organisations and professional bodies, as exists in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, but not in the original directive—an interesting point. There is protection from discrimination by a former employer even after the employment relationship has ended, for example, when providing a reference. It includes support for people claiming discrimination, and for those who have a legitimate interest in supporting individuals taking cases, such as trades unions, equality bodies and citizen advice bureaux.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is protection from victimisation for those complaining of sex discrimination. There is a requirement on member states to designate bodies for the promotion of equal treatment, and of dialogue between the two sides of industry, which is to be achieved in accordance with national traditions. The text also includes a requirement on the European Commission to report every five years on positive action measures undertaken by member states from information provided by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are sensible and practical measures supported by all member states. We shall strongly defend the common position, although we are not totally opposed to clear, workable improvements. The directive is for co-decision by the Council and the European Parliament. Under that process, the European Parliament proposed amendments. The Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
has the document that shows that the European Commission has taken a view on the 15 amendments. In the main, it has rejected, or partially accepted, them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During negotiations, the UK was conscious of the need to ensure that any amendment was consistent with the principle of equal treatment between men and women, and with other relevant legislation. That legislation makes a difference to the working lives of women and men, and all of it must be appropriately linked to, but differentiated from, the equal treatment directive, so as not to confuse case law arising from different directives. The European Parliament amendments do not sufficiently recognise that. They blur the distinction between equal treatment on the grounds of sex, and between those pieces of legislation that flow from the social agenda in respect of balancing family and working life. The Commission acknowledges that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission also shares our view that the European Parliament's amendments depart from the texts of the two article 13 directives. All member states want clarity not only to avoid confusion, but to avoid lengthy and expensive references to the European Court of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that we are currently consulting on how to implement the two article 13 directives through regulations in the UK. We have allowed a long consultation period and it is currently going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as those proposals are concerned, the next stage is the formal one of conciliation, which will begin very shortly. I cannot predict the outcome, but I can predict that the UK will continue to work with other member states, the Commission and the presidency to achieve a workable and legally sound directive. In doing so, we shall continue to set out our position clearly with reasons for any concern, while recognising the need to reach a compromise that is acceptable to all. I hope that that will help the Committee in its deliberations this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now how have until 5.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind members of the Committee that their questions should be brief, and should be asked and answered one at a time. With mutual co-operation there should be ample opportunity for all hon. Members present to ask more than one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I am new to the European Standing Committee format and I appreciate any gentle redirection that may be necessary along the way. I have a series of questions, which are, as you recommended, short. I know that other hon. Members may also have questions and I am happy to take my turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is a general one: does the Minister accept that many employers have become wary of getting it wrong on sex discrimination? Clearer guidelines will need to be issued to give employers confidence in the correct way to approach recruitment,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
staff retention and discipline while avoiding discrimination. On first acquaintance with the bundle from the Vote Office I had to apply a cold towel to my forehead in order to read it. It is no understatement to say that it is fairly technical. When the text is concluded, what does the Minister have in mind to make it readily intelligible to people who have to use it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), and I would say, without any disrespect, that much of this is for the anoraks. The Committee is faced today with the common position from the Council, detailed amendments from the European Parliament and the opinion from the Commission. We shall then go into a period of conciliation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Lady's point. It is important that we look for clarity both for employees and employers. In a sense, that is part of the UK's position as far as that agenda is concerned. We are now updating a directive that dates back to 1976—without giving my age away, that was about one year after I came down from university—which is a long time ago. Case law has developed, and we need to bring the directive up to date. I hope that by bringing this up today and by having a common position—of course, if there are sensible improvements, we shall look to them—we shall reach a position that is helpful to employees and employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report suggests that there is a three-month period from the end of October 2001 to consider proposed amendments. From what my hon. Friend the Minister said, I wondered whether we had missed any consultative deadlines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we have not. We are just about to go into the period of conciliation, which will probably start from 21 February. We have been fully engaged in the process, and bodies such as the EOC have been considering it carefully. I know from my discussions with the chair of the EOC and her deputy that they are fully aware—this touches on the point raised by the hon. Member for Meriden—of the need to provide advice and information to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) referred to the consultation period that is currently underway on the two directives under article 13. That consultation is proceeding, and we would be interested in receiving representations from MPs on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden about getting one's head around the bundle. The starting point, which was the 1976 directive, was the last item in the bundle, and the amendments seem to appear twice, almost at random, in the middle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about amendment No. 12, which concerns victimisation. It is before the European Parliament, but the Commission has not accepted it on the grounds that workers' representatives are "employees" and covered by the common position. The UK Government are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
opposing the amendment and I can see why. Those who would act as advocates for people who had been discriminated against under the provisions of the directive might not be employees, as the Minister suggested in her introduction. They might be trade union officials, representatives from a citizens advice bureau or lawyers. They should be protected. As the deliberations of the Council of Ministers are not conducted in public, would the Minister tell us what line she is likely to take on the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason that the amendment does not present a problem for us is that our legislation already covers it. It is interesting that we in the UK, unlike other member states, have a long history of legislation in that field, as we do in race relations. We will, of course, listen to what other member states have to say about definitions, but the amendment would not cause us any difficulty, and that is what we will say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the EOC in her opening remarks. It is obviously involved, but is it happy with the British position on the various amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have had quite a few meetings recently with the EOC, I have not had detailed discussions on every point and I would not want to put words into its mouth. It appreciates the balance that we are trying to achieve. We want effective regulation and to bring it up to date, but we do not want to place excessive burdens on employers so that the system becomes unworkable. We see very much eye to eye with the EOC on the creation of a culture where all companies appreciate that the way to ensure better productivity is by having a diverse work force and gender equality. The EOC is working closely with industry to bring that about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what the hon. Member for Luton, North said about the importance of finding out what the EOC position is. If the Minister does ask the EOC for its views, it would be interesting to be informed of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister touched on the question of clarity of definitions. Definitions are one of the problems. In working my way through the bundle, I am left unclear about the definition of indirect discrimination in amendments 4 and 5, namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the situation where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice puts persons of one sex at a particular disadvantage compared with persons of the other sex, unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate and proportionate aim, and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary".</p></blockquote>
I am relieved to see that the Commission's common position is that this would be inoperable. Will the Minister give an example of what she considers to be indirect discrimination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indirect discrimination can be all sorts of things. Part of the difficulty is that as case law has grown up, there have been different ways of interpreting it in legislation. A difficulty with the European Parliament's proposals is that they are contrary to some definitions that were agreed for
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
implementation of the article 13 directives. Indirect discrimination could be an artificial bar that discriminated against women. A good—and personally heartfelt—example would be a height bar. It could be said that one could not be a Minister if one could see only three inches over the Dispatch Box. That would be a totally unnecessary bar, and a good example of indirect discrimination. Alas, it does not cover ministerial appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify amendment 6 and comment on the helpful table that sets out the three positions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In column 1, the European Parliament's view appears to be that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any general exclusion of…one sex having access to any kind of professional activity"</p></blockquote>
shall constitute discrimination. That would include a bar on joining a branch of the armed services. In column 2, the Commission's view appears to be that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is already implicitly covered by the Common Position".</p></blockquote>
In column 3, the Commission's view appears to be that it has been established through case law that there are cases where sex could be a reasonable determining factor. The armed forces are one such example. Does the Minister agree that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is already implicitly covered"</p></blockquote>
in column 2 means that the Commission believes that the effect of column 1 is already in force, and that we would have to change our position on the armed forces?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. My interpretation is that the Commission is saying that the common position reflects current case law and would, in part, be what the UK has established. The current sex discrimination legislation and established case law reflect the position well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to amendment 7, I welcome the common position on maternity and paternity leave. It is more realistic as it offers the female returner an equivalent post on comparable terms rather than offering her the exact job that she left. I agree with the Minister that the parental leave directive is a better way of dealing with maternity and paternity leave. However, does the Minister accept that the cost and practical implications are disproportionately hard on smaller businesses? In the case of a company that employs only four people, two of whom are female, if one becomes pregnant soon after the other, it could cause such a small business some difficulty. There is no provision under the European equal treatment directive for any consideration of assistance for or exemption of small businesses. The Government are reasonably sympathetic to small businesses in that regard. Is the Minister prepared to campaign on behalf of small businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that in a former life I was a Minister responsible for small businesses, I am always happy to talk about them. However, I fear that I would earn your displeasure, Mr. O'Hara, if I went on about them for too long, because they are outside the scope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of the directive. The hon. Lady is right, which is why we, with the European Commission, believe strongly that one must stick to the common position. However, those matters are more properly raised in relation to the parental leave directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should perhaps preface everything I say today with my concern for the interests of women employees and that the balance is tipped in their favour rather than towards employers. The fact that I worked in the trade union movement for 23 years might flavour my comments. Has the Trades Union Congress made representations to the Government on these issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, it has not done so on detail, although we have an extremely helpful and continuing dialogue with it in the same way as we have with employers' organisations. If any of them wanted to make representations to us, we would be pleased to listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again relates to amendment 6. Amendment 3 of the equal treatment directive states that there should be no direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of gender. Does the Minister accept that there are certain jobs in which it may be more appropriate to call for interview only female or male applicants? I am thinking about, for example, women applying for the post of nursery nurse or men for a heavy lifting job. Should that constitute discrimination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of some better examples, if the hon. Lady will forgive me for saying so. Flippantly, one could understand a genuine occupational requirement in an advertisement for Father Christmas and, more seriously, one could see why there was a requirement for a woman in an advertisement for a rape counsellor. I note the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North. It is important that the legislation is seen to be workable for employers, employees and those who advise employees—trade unions. They must have a body of legislation that is sensible and workable, as our legislation has proved to be over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the last question, does the Minister agree that the definition of indirect discrimination in amendment 2 summarises the necessary distinction very well by saying that neutral criteria that in practice discriminate against one sex should not be used unless that provision is objectively justified by a legitimate aim, such as having women as rape counsellors? To take the previous example, there are probably some women who are much better at lifting heavy weights than I am and, similarly, I might be better than certain women at being a nursery nurse. In such cases, the criteria should be perhaps a direct specification of what is needed for the job, rather than the sex of the applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point well, which is why the common position at which the Council arrived is sensible. There will always be different circumstances, which is why cases may go to industrial tribunals, employment appeal tribunals and then perhaps the courts. The balance of our judgment is that the common Council position is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is important to give rights to people who feel that they are the victims of sexual discrimination. That is what we are trying to achieve. However, we must be careful about creating a culture in which litigation becomes increasingly an option that people are encouraged to take. In some cases people prey on others, urging them to take the litigation route. Rather than saying under article 6 that judicial procedure should be available to those who consider themselves wronged, would it not be more effective to say that judicial procedures and assistance should be made available to those who have evidence that they have been wronged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on what the hon. Lady means by evidence. Clearly, an independent body of legal status would be needed to weigh the evidence. As soon as that independent element was in our system, its decisions could be subject to judicial review. The hon. Lady has not persuaded me, although I agree with her that it is important for employers and employees to exhaust other methods before going down the route of the tribunal. In the best regulated work places when genuine issues or grievances emerge, people resolve them together. When cases go to court there is usually a prima facie case of some kind. I welcome the work that bodies like the EOC and the TUC have done to explain the law to employers and employees so that they can look at conciliation and resolving grievances and disputes internally before seeking the next step up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 6 states that victims of discrimination should receive compensation or reparation. What does reparation mean here? When it talks of measures that are "dissuasive and proportionate", does it mean an increase in the extent of punishment or is the Minister satisfied that the present levels are satisfactory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are satisfied that the common position is right. It is different in different jurisdictions, but certainly under our jurisdiction there would be compensation payments for loss in that area. Our difficulty with the position that has been put forward by the European Parliament is that it talks about sanctions. It is unclear what that would mean. It would be quite an escalation and a departure. There is a difference. We do not have an upper limit as they do in some other jurisdictions. Perhaps there is a bit of confusion there. Again, it is a good example where I believe that the common position is correct. It is balanced and full of common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Minister out a little on amendment 6, which has not been accepted by the Commission. It might relate to certain areas of the armed forces. The European Parliament's amendment was that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"any general exclusion of, or restriction on, one sex having access to any kind of professional activity or to the training required to gain access to such an activity constitutes discrimination".</p></blockquote>
The Minister will be aware that I spoke firmly in favour of the Sex Discrimination (Election of Candidates) Bill. It is a form of positive discrimination. Does the hon. Lady have an opinion on whether it might fall foul of the new directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. I am grateful for the support of the hon. Gentleman and of the hon. Member for Meriden for the legislation, which had all-party support. In our opinion the directive does not cover legislation of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an interesting point. The attraction of making amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act in that way is that it is permissive legislation, which Conservative Members infinitely prefer; it gives more flexibility to parties that must use the legislation to interpret it in a way that best suits them. However, much that is proposed under the directive—mostly the aspects that, mercifully, are not upheld by the common position—is quite prescriptive. Is the Minister not a little disappointed that her party backed away from equal treatment? Its quota for female representatives was reduced from 50 per cent. to 30 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed at that note of party politics. I have great regard for the hon. Lady, but she is guilty of "chutzpah", a Yiddish word that means cheek, and is defined in the example of a man—it is a man in this case—who murders both his parents and, in his plea of mitigation to the court, claims that he is an orphan. The Labour party's proposal is to achieve 50:50 representation; it is committed to taking positive measures to achieve that ratio, unlike the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Meriden's remarks were out of order, although they were diverting and entertaining. I appeal to members of the Committee to stay strictly in order, as they have done, commendably, so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise to do as you direct, Mr. O'Hara, and to return to the matter in hand. I realise that I was not speaking from a position of strength. We look to the Government to give the lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 states that employees should be protected from dismissal or other adverse treatment. In certain circumstances, notably when there has been a malicious allegation—there was such a case in my constituency—should not employers have the right to take action against employees? We are trying to strike the right balance between employers and employees in our response to the directive; if employees continually make unfounded allegations, should they receive protection from adverse treatment in such circumstances? Can the Minister clarify the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us take a case in which the employer claims that there are a series of unfounded allegations, about discrimination or anything else, that are without merit; the employer takes appropriate action; the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
employees decide that it is a matter of discrimination and take the matter to a tribunal. Of course, the tribunal would be entitled to consider all the circumstances of the case. If it found that the allegations were false or malicious, the legislation would not protect them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged to hear that. It will be in the record; it is an important balance between employer and employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does article 8b mean? It sounds as if we should support the idea of social dialogue between social partners, but the monitoring of work practices sounds like a recipe for excessive interference. Of course, workers must have the right to complain if they are being discriminated against, but does the Minister agree that the wording of the article is a licence to interfere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the balance is about right. Language is always difficult when several member states are relevant. The Government's grant funding to EOC, which engages in dialogue with employers and employees, is an example. It may bring 60 test cases across the year. Its object is to promote equal treatment and it gains wide cross-party support. The provision will ensure that the EOC's work is carried on. We disagree with the European Parliament, which wants to put in place a statutory duty on companies. Our better companies—for reasons connected with social justice as well as productivity—will want to follow these good practices, but we do not want to impose an unnecessary burden that might prove inoperable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come back to the "monitoring of workplace practices". Article 8b reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member states shall…in accordance with national practices and law".</p></blockquote>
That is intriguing. What exactly does the provision mean? Is it not a recipe for constantly visiting and revisiting the workplace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are rejecting the European Parliament's proposal to create legal duties on employers to promote equal treatment and report on their actions, which we view as an unacceptable burden on business. Our national tradition is represented by our support to EOC, whose work is highly regarded in the European context. Much of its work comprises discussions with interested parties, forums with trade unions, the CBI and so forth. The proposal establishes some current practice in the UK. Other member states have similar systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw out the Minister on another potential effect of the directive? Could it impinge on those who give freely of their time—working for charities, charity clubs and societies throughout the country—despite no contract of employment and no money changing hands? I remind the Minister of my Sex Discrimination (Amendment) Bill. I hope that she will be in her place on 15 March to keep her own Whips quiet and stop them from shouting "object" when it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
comes before the House. Will she clarify whether the directive would apply to those who are effectively in unpaid employment with no contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think so. It applies to those in employment, so it hinges on how we define employment. I know about the hon. Gentleman's forthcoming Bill and I shall follow its progress closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us return to article 8b. Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that we could assist the Conservative Front-Bench spokeswoman, the hon. Member for Meriden, by considering the alternative to the passage, which would be not to monitor workplace practices? Would we not then be operating in a vacuum? We might pass various regulations, but we would have no idea whether they were being implemented in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the common position proposes seems extremely sensible. It suggests reporting within a reasonable amount of time—we certainly would not want it to be a short period—on what is happening in practice. We will have much of the information nationally, and some will come from the EOC. It seems sensible for us to pass that to the Commission, not least because it will enable EU-wide comparisons to be made. That will help us as well as Parliaments elsewhere in the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I asked the Minister to clarify what the directive meant, she said en passant that she was not sure what "sanctions" meant either. I should like to pursue that point, however, because it is important to our understanding of the directive's likely impact. We should have at least some idea of what article 8d means. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall lay down the rules on sanctions applicable to infringements".</p></blockquote>
I am concerned as to what sanctions the Government propose to introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not making such a proposal. People at the European Parliament are talking about sanctions, which is a matter for them. We believe that the common position would reflect our compensation regime, which is the one that we would want to uphold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have misunderstood. This bundle of documents is not the easiest to read. I could not find an amendment that proposed sanctions, but I read that as part of the article that I thought we were likely to have to accept. I will have to go back to the drawing board on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also looked for an assessment of the likely financial implications of this document. For a European Standing Committee, there is often an assessment of likely financial implications as part of the explanatory memorandum. That is an important aspect of our discussion, because as the Minister has said, we can all see the potential for a considerable increase in costs on business. The explanatory memorandum that I found said that no assessment of the financial implications
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
could be made until the final text was known, but the Government must have an approximate idea of the cost to business. Has the Minister estimated the cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the questions that the hon. Lady is asking. It may help if I say that the point about sanctions could be interpreted to mean some sort of punitive regime. We would not want to see that. She is right that a regulatory impact assessment was prepared for the first proposal. The difficulty relates to the final definitions and coverage of harassment. Our concern is to ensure that the final form of the directive reflects as closely as possible the UK position, which has grown up over time and is well understood by employers and employees, and our case law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a more general question about the process, partly because I am unfamiliar with the way in which it works. At the outset, the Minister talked about the stage that had been reached in the consultative process and the joint decision-making power between the European Parliament and the Council. I want to ascertain for the Opposition the likelihood of these amendments standing or falling. It would help me to know the political complexion of the European parliamentarians who tabled the amendments. Were any Labour Members party to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That question is out of order. The subject of the debate is strictly the amendments. The hon. Lady's question takes the Committee beyond that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a shame. I may not have phrased my question correctly, and perhaps I should find another way of putting it. I am interested to know the likelihood of the common position being sustained. Does the Minister know how many member states support the common position? She is nodding. It is important to know whose view will hold sway, as this is a joint decision-making process. I presume that it must go back to the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A conciliation process will start now, and the Spanish Minister will lead the Council, as Spain holds the presidency. The Council agreed on the common position. The European Parliament and the Commission will be represented. They will have several weeks to arrive at a decision. The Parliament's view comes from its Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 14492/01, the Opinion of the European Commission on the European Parliament's amendments to the Council's common position regarding the draft Directive amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions; and supports the Government's aim of maintaining the Council's common position which updates the Equal Treatment Directive in line with case law and developments in European law.—	<i>[Mrs. Roche.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reserved my comments for a speech, rather than questions, as I wish to make several points. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take them in good part. I want to ensure that we are doing our best to protect the interests of women workers in particular. I appreciate that I am a man who is speaking about the interests of women employees, but I hope that my background in feminist environments for the past 30 years gives me some qualification to speak on issues that affect women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important issues at stake. The EU and the capitalist market face a conflict between those who want to maintain some of the rights and support that employees have developed over centuries of struggle and through the election of progressive Governments, and those who want to return—or to advance, as some might see it—to a more rigorously flexible market where employees are weaker and more fragmented compared with employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU is riven with that big issue. The TUC still sees the EU as dirigistes who are advancing employee rights. Some, including our Government, are pushing for more flexibility in employment to assist the market to work more effectively. I am unhappy about that divide in the EU. Some countries, such as France and Germany, are still regarded as much more rigid in their protection of employees. Other countries, such as ours, have less worker protection. We are trying to argue that other countries should be more like us, rather than the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as a trade unionist as well as a Back-Bench Labour Member of Parliament. Historically, we, as a party, have looked after and advanced the interests of employees. Given that the majority of people are employees, or depend on employees, that is a primary concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conflict is worrying. The European Parliament seems to have adopted a strong protectionist position for employees. The Commission has modified that to get member states on board. In the Council, member states have watered down what the Commission has said, and we are trying to do that as a member state. I hope that my hon. Friend, as Minister for Women, rather than as a Minister for industry, will continue to advance the interests of women as employees. The Government must have a coherent position that is publicly defensible, but I hope that the Minister will press the case of women employees and not give in to pressure from those advancing the interests of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many see flexible labour markets as the way forward. Germany currently has an economic crisis and has come into conflict with the European Commission. I am pleased to say that the Chancellor has persuaded the Commission not to criticise—at least not in public—the German Government for managing their economy. It will certainly not impose sanctions at this stage. The Chancellor has stood up for the Government's decision to spend more on the health service; that is absolutely right. It is argued that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Germany's problem is its inflexible labour markets and it should reduce costs by making markets more flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexible labour markets can mean one of two things, depending on whether one is an employee or an employer. For an employee, a flexible labour market may mean the right to take maternity leave when one chooses, or the right to work part-time. It may mean all sorts of factors that improve life and give the employee flexibility in the organisation of working life. However, for most people, flexible markets mean a situation in which employers have the right to operate their work force more flexibly, and decide how the work force is organised. In that case, flexibility gives more power to employers. Employees' flexibility could mean additional costs for employers; employers' flexibility would be aimed at reducing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like our Government and the EU to ensure that we defend all those advances on behalf of employees that have been made by our party and our Government, and by other Governments and parties similar to ours in the EU over many decades, particularly since the second world war. Those advances were hard-won and transformed people's lives. I want to see them maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a different approach to employee relations in Britain for many years. We thought that the way forward was a strong trade union movement and collective bargaining. Trade unions had strong bargaining power and they did not need the intervention of law in the workplace. Provided that they had certain protection in taking industrial action and so on, they could protect and advance the interests of the majority of working people. The continent of Europe had its trade union movements broken and destroyed during the second world war, when countries were occupied and conquered. After the war, they developed trade unions that were different from ours, and they built into their constitutions protections in law for their workers, which we did not think we needed in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past 20 or 30 years, trade union strength has greatly weakened. I know that because I have worked in the trade union movement for a long time. We have accepted the need to introduce law to protect workers' rights, including the right of women workers to equal treatment at work. That is why the amendments are so important. We have moved on from a world in which strong trade unionism alone ensures that workers are protected. We need the protection of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking generally, and in an expression of support for my hon. Friend the Minister, I hope that she carries forward those concerns in her continuing consideration of the matter, especially because she is a woman herself. The spokesperson for the Opposition on the issue is, rightly, a woman. We should ensure that the outcome of the negotiation appropriately balances employers and employees, particularly women employees. Time and again, we hear references to burdens on business. All employee payments—even allowing employees time off at weekends and for holidays—are burdens on business. It would be better
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
to refer to an unacceptable or unreasonable cost to employers rather than simply to say that we cannot do something because it is a "burden on business". I am reluctant to use that phrase, and do not usually do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lepper 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding my hon. Friend's comments, does he agree that the Government have introduced legislation that extends the rights of employees in the workplace to be represented by trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have supported that legislation very strongly. There has been strong negotiation between the Government—and our party when in opposition—and the trade union movement; an example of successful negotiation between Parliament and the interested parties outside it. That has led to some welcome progressive legislation. However, we must accept that there has been tension, with disappointments on some sides and some reluctance from the Government to be pushed too far on worker protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will always be tensions there, and I want to ensure that we as a party, and as a Government, do not go too far in the direction of liberalising markets by undermining or weakening workers' rights with the objective of making business more competitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have mentioned small businesses. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a danger in having different rules for small and for large businesses? Obviously, we see the problem for a firm with only two employees, one of whom is on maternity leave or off work for another reason. However, if we make distinctions, we get a problem analogous to the poverty trap, where people could not afford to be paid more because they would actually be worse off. We do not want a situation in which small businesses cannot afford to grow in case they lose extra protections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. In the legislation that has been introduced, there are provisions for company size. We all appreciate the need for that. Although it is the Government's duty to ensure that employees have reasonable protection even in small companies, it is clearly unreasonable for a small company to disappear because it has three women employees, all of whom become pregnant and have maternity leave at the same time. It is necessary to take account of company size, but we also need careful legislation to give reasonable protection to employees in all companies. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister is not suggesting that we should let off small companies and say that nothing shall apply to them. Small companies still employ people, and there should be reasonable protection for them, even if it is not as rigorous and burdensome as it would be for a large company that can more easily afford it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I mention that there is not a small firm exemption under present legislation and has not been since 1983.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening extremely carefully to the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins). I remind him that the subject of debate is the amendments. His comments have ranged widely. He quoted from the amendments, which brought him into order on occasion, and I would like him to do that a bit more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I was just about to come to amendment No. 14, article 1.7, as an example of my point. It proposes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that employers promote equal treatment for men and women in the workplace,"</p></blockquote>
and goes on to discuss the provision of statistics about the treatment of men and women in the workplace. The Commission suggests measures "to encourage" rather than "to ensure." Our amendment resists the idea more or less in its entirety, and that is slightly uncomfortable. Collecting statistics and information about employees in the workplace is not too burdensome, provided that they are not collected on a daily basis. An annual report on provision for men and women in a particular company would not be more burdensome than filling in a tax return, for example, and I believe that it is the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, there was great resistance among local authorities and companies to ethnic monitoring. However, some of us pushed very hard for it, and it is now accepted that there must be monitoring to ensure that people are fairly treated and that there is a balance between ethnic minority and majority employees. To ensure that women are protected in the workplace, some sort of monitoring, or statistics, surely will be in order. That is just one example; perhaps there are others. Without knowing the law in detail, the issue is rather impenetrable, but that example came to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope and trust that my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that we do not weaken too much proposals that will give better protection to women in the work force, and that she will take full account of any proposals and recommendations made to her and to the Government by the Equal Opportunities Commission and by the TUC, if and when they decide to make them. I am speaking up for employee interests. I do not think that there is anything wrong with that, because the talk these days tends to focus constantly on burdens on business and flexible labour markets. I wish to ensure that we retain the advances that have been made by employees in the past several decades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We believe that legislation can be used to encourage equal treatment of the sexes, but that true equality only comes about organically as attitudes change in society. The stimulus for changing attitudes needs to be credible. We welcome the Commission's rejection of a number of proposed amendments to the European directive that would, in our opinion, prove inoperable or undermine the credibility of some good aspects of the legislation. The Government have come to a balanced view in that respect. We cannot estimate the benefits of the European directive in isolation from the regulatory climate in which we have to operate. It seems to us that business is already groaning under the weight of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) has just spoken on behalf of the employee, for the balance to be right in both the debate and the Standing Committee, it is right to place on the record a few objective assessments of the regulatory climate in which the European directive, with or without those amendments, is going to fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's report on the United Kingdom economy highlighted the
	<br><blockquote><p>"considerable volume of new regulations".</p></blockquote>
The Engineering Employers Federation said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The growing burden of regulation remains a serious concern for business…increasing costs, reducing flexibility and diverting management time from efforts to increase productivity."</p></blockquote>
Of course, that has to be weighed up alongside any benefits that the directive would bring. The Institute of Directors said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is little doubt that the cumulative increase in the regulatory burden on business over the last four years has been considerable and is beginning to damage business flexibility and competitiveness".</p></blockquote>
The IOD made that statement on 27 November, the day of the pre-Budget report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservatives realise that ending discrimination against women involves more than stricter legislation against employers. We need to look at why women are discriminated against and how that affects their professional success. We have shown practical awareness of that issue by giving our support to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, to which we have referred. It enables political parties to take positive action of the kind referred to in the directive. As part of choosing what type of positive action we will use, we must consider the factors in our selection process that limit the capacity of female candidates to achieve their full potential. The prescriptive nature of some aspects of the directive and of the amendments, had they been accepted, may not get to the bottom of the full range of factors that cause discrimination in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By comparison, some aspects of the equal treatment directive and the proposed amendments seem to us to be unnecessarily burdensome. The unwieldy definitions of the type to which I referred in the question section and the lack of balance between the rights of employers and employees can cause those who are going to have to work with them a sense of despair. If we have difficulty comprehending what the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
legislation means, what hope is there for busy people who do not have the time to crawl through lengthy explanatory notes to new rules and regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the final text is agreed after a lengthy process of conciliation among the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, I urge the Government to get somebody to put it in plain English to allow those who will have to work with it to understand it. Unworkable definitions will undermine the confidence of those who have to use them. There will be a temptation to avoid the risks altogether by simply not employing women who might, in time, create a headache for the employer, who must try to absorb the cost of new entitlements. Unless the text is clear, simple and doable, employers may try to avoid the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many enlightened employers are responding beyond the prescription of the equal treatment directive. Given the increasing feminisation of the workplace—especially in the growth sector of the service industry, in which greater emphasis is placed on good listening and communication skills—women are increasingly seen as assets. Good employers recognise that only women can have babies, and they will bend over backwards to encourage a woman's return to work on her preferred terms after she has had a baby. The increasing recognition of the benefits of retaining valuable female employees has had a knock-on effect on male employees with family responsibilities who are now seizing the new opportunities to ask for what they need to support their family life. The underlying question is whether to use a carrot or a stick to disseminate best practice in the treatment of different genders in the workplace; I know which my party would prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bundle of documents that I collected from the Vote Office concerning the Standing Committee contains an explanatory memorandum. Under the section on financial implications, it states that the cost will depend on the final text. I urge the Government to make the financial implication assessment available as soon as possible because there is considerable sensitivity in the business community about additional costs and regulations. I am sure that I am not the only hon. Member— particularly, in my case, with the proximity of manufacturing in the west midlands—to have business men visiting my surgery to complain bitterly about the regulatory burden that they face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept that the major problem faced by manufacturers is the valuation of our currency relative to other currencies and that a substantial over-valuation is more significant than ensuring that women are treated well at work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention but, to avoid being ruled out of order, Mr. O'Hara, we must speak to the directive. However, I would contest whether currency is the only factor involved. The climate change levy has been the last straw for some manufacturing companies and has contributed to some going out of business. I beg to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
differ with the hon. Gentleman on there being one factor, which explains why business is so sensitive to the cost of regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That reference slipped past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I emphasise that the directive will come into force in the context of other regulations on businesses. Last night, the House discussed the Employment Bill on Report and the regulatory implications for business were quantified as a one-off cost of £11 million and a recurring cost of £100 million per year. Business will not consider the implications of this directive in isolation. It cannot afford to. It must comply with regulations that are imposed upon it and it is relevant to place on the record the regulatory climate into which this directive will fall. I ask the Government to note that while such legislation often contains desirable goals, they all cost money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, Mr. O'Hara, the hon. Member for Meriden suggested that legislation on equal opportunities in relation to political parties might be affected by the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To emphasise women's listening skills, I heard the Minister say at the beginning of our proceedings that that is not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will take a second for me to explain. The proposal is that member states may maintain or adopt measures with a view to ensuring full equality between men and women and that such measures are explicitly permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Government's general position on the measure. We have tried to strike a reasonable balance, although we recognise that every regulation imposes a burden on business. I worked in business for 18 years before coming to the House and the overwhelming desire of most businesses is for a reasonably stable, broad environment. Most businesses are happy to comply with reasonable regulations throughout the European Union, but they face problems when politicians in general chop and change and constantly revise regulations. There has been extensive consultation on the directive and we should give it a fair wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Cabinet Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. This has been a useful discussion with many good contributions. The debate has been about not just our aspirations to deal with discrimination, but having the practical mechanisms to end it. It is essential that we have workable and proportionate mechanisms that deliver redress effectively. In negotiating the proposal, we are working towards a clear, workable text for those whom it will affect. An equality regime that is not clear about what people must do to comply with it is likely
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
to be counter-productive. Through the directive, we want to move the equality agenda forwards, not backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins). I say to him strongly that we seek to update the directive so that it embodies the position in case law, which has grown over many years. Some case law has been created by the United Kingdom; we take such measures seriously, and have a record in this area that goes back to 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned amendment 14, which was proposed by the European Parliament. I do not believe that that moves in the right direction. It talks about not just statistics, but about a whole body of reporting; it is unclear. A much better way to proceed is that taken by the Equality Opportunities Commission. It will shortly launch a rights and responsibilities campaign to inform employers and employees about discrimination, sexual harassment and, in particular, the position following the directive. The Department of Trade and Industry will also be running a major campaign about new rights under employment legislation. That work is extremely important. We have a good track record in this country of progressing in the direction of the proposals, and want to give support to that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said about the regulatory burden. I would hate to make a party-political point, but I remember sitting on the Opposition Front Bench as spokesperson for trade and industry. I would hate to quote what the Institute of Directors, and others, then said about excessive regulation under the Conservative years, because I would not want to embarrass her. The common position that the Council has adopted is close to UK legislation, so any increased cost to business should be minimal. However, as soon as we can report information, we will. I absolutely agree with a tremendously telling point that the hon. Lady made about women's listening skills. That remark should have a wider audience in the Chamber of the House of Commons, as well as in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) referred to the legislation on representation passing through Parliament. In our opinion, that is not subject to the directive. I say to the Committee, and particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, that our position on updating legislation using the equal treatment directive will be of tremendous use to women, not only in the United Kingdom, but across Europe. The text includes: definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, and of third party instructions to discriminate; the right to return to work after maternity leave; a definition of sexual harassment; notice that the principle of equal treatment is to be extended to trade unions, employers' organisations and professional bodies; and notice of protection from discrimination by a former employer, and from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
victimisation. Those points usefully update our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our most important tasks is to unlock the talent and potential of all our citizens. Every man and woman in this country has a valuable contribution to make throughout their lives. Equality is a basic component of that. So far as the Government are concerned, fairness at work and productivity go hand in hand. The best employers, as the hon. Member for Meriden said, already appreciate the business benefits of using the experience and skills of all their work force, part-time or full-time, male or female. We all want to see a change of culture so that the best practice in the best companies goes down through the supply chain into small and medium-sized enterprises. However, it is fair to say, as I know from my experience with small businesses, that many smaller enterprises often have good and deep-rooted equality policies.

We believe strongly that the common position at which we have arrived is correct. We shall seek to negotiate and conciliate along those lines. Where there are sensible proposals and amendments we shall take them on board, but we strive to have a proper and appropriate balance in this important area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
