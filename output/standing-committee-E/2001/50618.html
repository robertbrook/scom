	<p>4.30pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two Ministers present today. I understand that Mr. Morley intends to make the opening statement and Ms Blears will respond to the debate that follows questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Chidgey. It is nice to serve under your chairmanship. This is the first time that you have chaired a debate in which I have participated and I look forward to your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to debate the Commission's complex proposals, which suggest amending the regulatory requirements for both human and veterinary medicines and introducing a directive on traditional herbal medicines. I shall try to make my opening remarks brief because that is appropriate in a scrutiny Committee. Unfortunately, the matter is quite complex and I will have to say more than usual in order to allow Committee members to hear the Government's views, about which I am sure they will want to ask questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to be joined by the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears). We are a double act, which is a new experience for me, as the documents cover veterinary medicines, for which I take responsibility in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and human medicines, for which my hon. Friend takes responsibility. She will be replying to the debate, which will give her an opportunity to pick up any points that have been raised, as well as joining me in answering questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will agree that the regulation of medicines is an important issue. We support the Commission's overall objectives for the review of medicines legislation. We have some concerns, which I am sure will come out in the debate, about the detail of the review, but its overall aim has the Government's support. The objectives are to guarantee a high level of public health protection for European Union citizens and provide fast access to innovative products; to complete the internal market for pharmaceutical products taking account of globalisation; to ensure the future competitiveness of the EU; to improve market surveillance; to meet the challenges of enlargement; to rationalise and simplify the system and make it more transparent; and to improve animal health by increasing the number of medicines available, which has been a problem in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been able to adopt a positive position in discussions in the Council working group in Brussels
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
on that important review. Members may welcome some background on the current legislative framework for the control of medicines and therefore the context in which both of those sets of proposals are set. There has been UK medicines legislation and national authorisation of human and veterinary medicinal products for the market for the past 35 years. Assessment of applications for a licence to market veterinary and human medicines in the UK and monitoring of their safety in use is undertaken in the case of animals by the veterinary medicines directorate and in the case of people by the Medicines Control Agency. Since 1965 a developing body of European legislation has progressively eroded and replaced elements of the Medicines Act 1968 such that most aspects of medicines regulation are now governed by a number of directives, which have recently been codified into a smaller number of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important of those regulations was introduced in 1995 and established the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, or EMEA. It also introduced the concept of a centralised licence issued by the European Commission, which is valid throughout the EU. The assessment of applications for a centralised licence and any other scientific work associated with the system remains the responsibility of member states. In that system two member states, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur, undertake the assessment of a product on behalf of the EU as a whole, but all member states have the opportunity to consider the reports in the relevant scientific committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that EMEA is broadly a co-ordinating body that relies on the experience of national specialist bodies. In this country, the VMD and the MCA, which are recognised for their scientific and regulatory expertise, have a very good record. I am sure that most hon. Members know that EMEA's central European office is based in Canary wharf in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the EU member states are involved in the operation of EMEA through their membership of the management board. In the past six years, the Commission has licensed about 2 per cent, of the products on the UK market. A system that ensures consistency of any nationally licensed product that is available in more than one state was introduced at the time that EMEA was established and became effective from 1 January 1998. It is known as the mutual recognition procedure. If a company wants to use it, it must identify one member state to lead the assessment, and all the other member states in which the company wishes to market the product must agree on certain aspects of the licence. However, the licences are national licences. I understand that the UK is often chosen to lead the assessments. Since 1995, companies have had to use the centralised procedure for biotechnology products and those that are considered to represent significant innovation but, at present, they can choose between the centralised procedure and the mutual recognition route of assessment for most other categories of application. The system has served us well but is changing, and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
directive is part of the Commission's review of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is much interest in traditional herbal medicines. We want to ensure that consumers continue to have access to a wide range of safe, traditional herbal remedies of appropriate quality. The current regulatory framework does not provide adequate safeguards for the public, and we continue to find examples of products on the UK market that pose a risk to public health; for example, remedies with toxic herbal ingredients such as aristolochia, which is used in traditional Chinese medicines but is associated with renal failure and cancer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share the view of the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, which conducted an inquiry into complementary and alternative medicine in 2000, that herbal remedies should be appropriately regulated as medicines. Therefore, we welcome the European Commission's proposals for a directive that introduces a more effective regulatory regime. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health will say more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum has been circulated, and hon. Members may wish to refer to it during the debate. It sets out the proposals and the areas in which the Government have concerns. I shall try to keep my opening remarks as brief as possible, because I know that many hon. Members may wish to speak. My hon. Friend and I are happy to answer any questions. Clearly, some details about the operation of the directive are yet to be discussed and negotiated, and the Government wish to take up some concerns with the Commission. However, overall, we think that the directive takes the right approach and presents a range of benefits for consumers in this country and in the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 5.30 pm for questions. Questions may be directed to either Minister, and they shall determine who will respond to each question. I remind Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in welcoming you, Mr. Chidgey, to your position. May I start by asking about the overall structure of what is proposed? Are Ministers satisfied that in imposing on veterinary medicines the strict approach that is proposed, there will not be a risk that safety will be compromised because animal medicines will simply not be brought forward as they have been previously, given the costs and bureaucratic nature of the proposal? Similarly, does not the same apply to herbal medicines? The strict controls imposed by the regulations is likely to mean that many products that are currently used safely will no longer be available to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a very fair point about cost and administration in relation to new products. However, there is nothing new about that problem. We already have a problem with veterinary products. Because of national regulations, some products are available in some European countries
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
but not here because the company concerned has taken a decision that the market in the UK is not really big enough for it to go through the regulatory proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These proposals do not completely resolve that problem but they recognise and address it, particularly through the centralised procedure, although we have some concerns about that. We would much rather allow companies the choice between the centralised procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The point is to try to keep administrative costs down and to strike a balance between ensuring that the costs are not exorbitant and ensuring that new products, whether they are veterinary or herbal products, are properly scrutinised in a transparent way, with proper regulation. That will be part of the ongoing debate that we shall have on this directive, but the point is recognised and we believe that, generally speaking, the directive goes in the right direction on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The organisation Consumers for Health Choice has written to members of the Committee. I am happy to pose its first question on its behalf. It says that, in its view, the directive on traditional herbal and medicinal products would effectively orphan several important categories of product by leaving them completely outside the regulatory framework. It says that even traditional herbal medicinal ingredients proven to be safe during the past 30 years will effectively be ruled out, even if they could comply with the pharmaceutical standards in the directive. Can the Under-Secretary of State for Health respond to that concern?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Hazel Blears)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say that I am pleased to be here, for my first scrutiny debate on these issues? I am delighted to have the opportunity to answer hon. Members' questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very well aware of the campaign conducted by Consumers for Health Choice. It has issued, I think, 1 million leaflets to constituents up and down the country and has obviously been in contact with manufacturers and retailers on the issues. There is perhaps a misconception over the matter that the right hon. Gentleman highlighted. There is nothing in the traditional herbal medicines directive that would change the classification of products that currently should not be available. Where there is a combination of active herbal ingredients and other active ingredients, they should have an authorisation as a medicine because they have a physiological effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new directive seeks to provide a better and more stable legal framework for traditional herbal medicines so that consumers can properly rely on them as safe, of the right quality and containing ingredients that are not contaminated. The directive, however, does not affect the status of products currently on sale. Those that the MCA is seeking to take away from sale, it is seeking to take away now because they do not fall within the licensing regime. The new directive does not affect their status. The issues have been slightly confused by the campaign, if it says that products that are not currently within the regulatory framework, so should not be on sale, are going to be outlawed by this directive. That is not the case. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
directive is about providing a more stable legal framework for traditional herbal medicines, to bring them further into the fold rather than to exclude them from the variety of products that can be sold in this field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured to hear that, because many of us are worried that the directive is going to be more restrictive. On that point, I have a question for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. As I understood it, he said that the Government were concerned about the safety of some mixed herbal remedies and that that was leading them to support regulation. He gave an instance of a Chinese herbal remedy that carried dangerous ingredients. Have such cases happened frequently, or is that a fairly small-scale one-off incident that should not incline us to the sort of eccentric regulation set out in the document? My understanding of the case mentioned was that the ingredient that concerned the Government was illegal anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been several examples of ingredients being used that have been found to be unsafe. The example to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary referred is that of aristolochia, which is a species known to cause cancer and renal failure. Sometimes, that has been accidentally included in traditional Chinese medicines instead of clematis or stephania, which should be included. That problem has occurred in the UK and other countries. An ingredient called teucrium has been used instead of scutellari. Teucrium is apparently linked with liver toxicity. The trade in unlicensed herbal remedies and ingredients is international.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other examples include digitalis, which has been used instead of plantain in the United States where they have had reports of cardiac arrhythmia. In Hong Kong, there have been reports of podophyllum root being used instead of gentian, which can cause serious toxicity and may be fatal. Japanese star anise is known to have convulsant effects and has been used instead of Chinese star anise. There have been some cases of creams with undeclared corticosteroids and heavy metals in them. I do not want to be alarmist and say that the issue is huge, but those ingredients have been used and have caused problems. The case for safety, quality and regulation is quite well made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Health seemed to be describing mistakes that were made in the original preparation. I am not too sure how regulation will stop mistakes being made. If those ingredients were illegal in the first place, why are we not making some things illegal to improve safety, rather than taking what the industry considers a rather heavy-handed approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is simply a matter of mistakes. The regulation will deal with quality standards, manufacture and the avoidance of contaminants. There is a suggestion that the manufacturing and quality standards that have been introduced by regulation are suitable only for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
pharmaceutical drugs. The CHC leaflet states that the directive will force herbal remedies into a regime that is suitable only for pharmaceutical drugs. I would take issue with that. Manufacturing standards are necessary to protect the public. They are appropriate and have been designed specifically with herbal medicines in mind. They are designed to ensure that ingredients are not contaminated by other ingredients, and that they have the purity necessary for any medicinal product. I believe that they are achievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had submissions from a range of small and medium manufacturers, which supported the directive. If they felt that the burdens were too great for them, they would have expressed those concerns to us. Small manufacturers in the herbal sector have said that they welcome the directive, and feel that it is important that it comes forward. The standards are necessary, appropriate and achievable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Under-Secretary of State for Health is happy with the proposed widening of the definition in article 1. It currently reads:
	<br><q><p>"Any substance or combination of substance which may be administered to human beings with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting, modifying physiological functions in human beings".</p></q>
That proposition has now been changed to
	<br><q><p>"a combination of substances which may be used in human beings".</p></q>
That is so wide it would also cover five vegetables and five pieces of fruit a day. Surely we should not be extending medical matters to deal with everyday food issues, never mind genuine substances that have been used in the past to aid people's health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The UK position on that is that we strongly oppose the effect of the provisions. We feel that, when products can be properly regulated, whether under food supplement or other regulations that are already in place, that is the correct way to deal with the matter. We do not want to create a hierarchy of medicines where everything that has a physiological effect must be regulated as a medicine. The proposals would catch items such as herbal teas and coffees, which is plainly ridiculous; there is also the prospect of them including tooth-whitening toothpaste. We want to ensure that the regulations are implemented sensibly. Borderline products should be identified so that they can be regulated if necessary, but we do not want unnecessary regulation. Our priority is that the Commission's proposals as drafted do not succeed, which we will ensure through negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never come across a patient who has been harmed, affected or who has lost anybody as a result of traditional and herbal remedies. Does the Under-Secretary of State for Health have any idea of the levels of morbidity and mortality that can be ascribed to those products?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no hard statistical information of the kind to which the hon. Gentleman refers. Clearly, we are only beginning to regulate traditional herbal medicines. For many years, a wide variety of products has been available, with very little hard evidence of their effects. The hon. Gentleman has highlighted the need to consider relevant regulation because we have

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
little substantive evidence. I quoted some of the examples of ingredients that have been found to be unsafe and incidents that have occurred, but I do not have widespread general information on morbidity in the population related to the use of herbal remedies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brian Iddon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Legislation in this area has clearly been unsatisfactory for a long time. Vitamins and minerals have slanted towards food legislation, while herbal products have slanted towards medical legislation. Some of us have been arguing for an equally long time that borderline products should be legislated on separately; herbal products should not be shoehorned into medicine legislation or vitamins and minerals into other legislation. I admire the example of Canada and others. Why have the UK Government not promoted special borderline legislation? It would avoid mismatches like these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that the best way forward is to try to support the proposed provision in the directive, which includes a proviso for a subsequent review of its extent. At the review, it may be possible to consider traditional medicines that contain other non-herbal ingredients. The right way forward is to use the proposals to achieve what we want for the UK and for the many people who have been involved for a long time in the manufacture of such products. We need to get a more sustainable and solid legal base for those products to establish the industry firmly, and to ensure the protection and safety of the public who depend on standards. There is no chance to achieve unanimity, or even widespread consensus, on an extension of the areas that might be covered under the directive, so we should press ahead with what we have and look to the review in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Tredinnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bosworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Health laid great store by the support from the British Herbal Medicine Association. Is she aware that its own members are criticising it for not taking into account their views? Is she also aware that there are many other organisations that she should consult because the BHMA represents only holders of products that are already licensed? She should consult half a dozen other organisations that are much more concerned about the proposals, particularly about the fact that herbs and nutrients in a blend will be removed from the market. Can she explain why she has relied so much on the BHMA, and address the worry about mixed herbs and nutrients coming off the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That view comes not only from the British Herbal Medicine Association, which represents about 36 small and medium companies in the sector, but from the European Herbal Practitioners Association, which represents most of the main herbal practitioner groups in this country. That association has had the view, for a number of years,
	<br><q><p>"that existing European medicines legislation is inadequate to ensure the quality and safety of herbal medicines."</p></q>
Thus it
	<br><q><p>"now broadly supports the proposed Directive … recognising that it represents the best chance to safeguard the public by ensuring reliable quality and safety standards…In our judgment, failure of the proposed Directive to pass into law could potentially jeopardise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
the supply of herbal medicines to the public since in the absence of agreed quality and safety standards for herbal medicines throughout the EU, there would undoubtedly be a loss of confidence in the sector."</p></q>
People involved in the sector, whose livelihoods are at stake, say that they want to see regulation because that will give the public better confidence in the products that they are purchasing, which may open the market to more people wanting to take part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When products can be registered, people involved in the sector will be able to make claims on what they can do. At the moment, they cannot do that so, again, progress will be able to be made. I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but there is a variety of views on the issues. Of course, the Government will want to hear from everyone who is concerned about them. We certainly do not have a closed mind, but there is a balance to be struck. Much campaigning has been done on specific issues and it is important to get the balance right. That balance must be between providing a proper base for traditional herbal remedies, many of which the public greatly value, and ensuring that access to those remedies is under standards that are safe, appropriate and achievable and that enable the public to have increased confidence in the products that they purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On combination products, which have been mentioned, I made that point at the outset. If combination products cannot prove efficacy or that they have had traditional usage, and if they cannot be sold as food, they currently cannot be sold. This directive does not affect the status of those products. It is misleading that the campaign has merged those two issues. Because the directive does not affect those products' status, it would not outlaw them. If products cannot prove efficacy or traditional usage, it must call into question the reason why they are being marketed and whether it is of any benefit or value for them to be supplied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Swayne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that all animal medicinal products are to be prescription only, can the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs tell us what investigation the Government have undertaken and what conclusions they have come to on who, in addition to veterinary surgeons, might properly issue such prescriptions? He will be aware that if veterinary surgeons are to have a monopoly on the supply of medicinal products for animals, there will be huge implications for a very hard-pressed livestock industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that, which is why we do not agree with that part of the proposal: we do not believe that it is necessary for all veterinary medicines to be prescription only. At the present time in this country, there are three levels of control. Prescription-only medicines include all medicines that might have dangerous residue. It is right that those should be under prescription and we have never sought to change that. There is also the pharmacy and merchants' list, the PML, and the general sales list. There is no control on the sale of those medicines. We feel that if some products do not have risks relative to consumers, extending prescription-only status to all veterinary medicines is not justified. We shall strongly

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
argue against that and we believe that we have support. We think that the Commission is mistaken in its approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the range of veterinary medicines, the directive proposes to allow additional medicines, particularly for the equine sector, on to the market. There has been a problem with the range of medicines for that sector, and some smaller market medicines will helpfully extend the range of veterinary medicines. We support that idea, but we think that the proposal on prescriptions is far too restrictive, and we shall oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend has just said worries me in part, because such medicines have traditionally been freely available in this country, much more so than in Europe. We were assured by his predecessors that the British Government were negotiating in Europe for maximum availability and freedom, and for an absence of control on that traditional market. However, we are today told that safety is important, although, as the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) put it, there has never been any evidence of danger or illness in this sector. What exactly is the Government's negotiating position in Europe? Are we negotiating to defend availability and freedom of the kind that we have always had in this country or are we accepting the principle of restriction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I ask hon. Members to try to keep their questions short and the Ministers to try to keep their replies succinct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Chidgey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend, of course we want to ensure that there is a minimum of bureaucracy over the availability of medicines. In my case, I am dealing with veterinary medicines; my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health deals with medicines for people. I must emphasise a point that she might want to mention later: there is evidence in this and other European countries of people being harmed by unregulated herbal medicines. There are real issues of concern, such as the use of antibiotics in animal treatment. That is already regulated and controlled through the prescription-only system. We do not want to increase risks to consumers over the use of animal treatments. We do not believe that the measures being proposed help in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the point is slightly different from that in this directive, we have reached an agreement to allow veterinary nurses to carry out a range of procedures. That is convenient, reduces costs for the livestock sector and has been very much welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Health is convincing herself as she develops her argument this afternoon, because I am not sure that she is carrying the rest of the Room with her. Has she made a study of the economic effect that the regulations, should they come into being, will have on the hundreds of specialist retailers up and down the country who now feel threatened and are writing to us as their constituency
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
representatives? They say that the regulations could well result in substantial cuts in the number of people employed in the health food industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the outset, I am aware that there is a balance of views on the issues from manufacturers, retailers and consumers. Everyone has an interest in the outcome and we welcome consultation from the retail sector as much as from the manufacturing sector. There was an assessment of the effect on the manufacturing sector, but that sector is not operating in isolation. It operates in anticipation of supplying goods to the health food sector. The British Herbal Medicine Association is completely in favour of the directives. I cannot believe for one moment that it would be in favour of regulation were manufacturers' products not then able to be sold by retailers to consumers. That is part of the whole supply chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People support the directive because they are, perhaps, taking something of a longer-term view: establishing the safety and reliability of herbal medicines will mean that in future the market will, hopefully, expand. More consumers will want to have access to the medicines because they will be properly regulated. The manufacturers certainly see the benefit of those arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Chidgey. In their remarks, the Ministers have been referring to various medical findings. Is there any error in the documentation pack prepared for Committee members? It should have included evidence-based information on the medical assessments of the dangers concerned, so that we might further understand some of the information now being given to us. I cannot find any reference to that in my pack. Was it an omission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the documents are circulated by the Departments concerned, and it is entirely up to them what they say. It is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister from DEFRA said a moment ago that he was not entirely happy with part of the legislation, and wanted it changed. The health Minister says that we do not want unnecessary regulation, and that some things need to be changed. We also hear that there is room for review of the regulations once they have come into effect. Why are we bothering? Why do we not say that we want to delay until we have sorted this out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can answer that question. The directive is being discussed in the EU, and has been referred to the European Parliament for its opinion. I know that MEPs are also concerned about some of the aspects that we have raised. It is normal to review and discuss a directive, and to ensure that the Commission is accountable to member states, through national Parliaments, in relation to concerns felt by us as a Government and indeed by individual hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the directive has been agreed, a review period will be provided at an appropriate time, as is right and proper, to take account of changes that may have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
made. That is exactly the same procedure that we apply to much of our own legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the health Minister expect to happen to products that are a combination of otherwise legal ingredients, but are outside the scope of the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it will still be possible to sell some products that are currently sold as food supplements. It will not be possible to sell combinations of active ingredients—herbal and other ingredients—unless they can be shown to be medically efficacious. That is the position now, and it is the position I described at the beginning. We are not talking about a new directive that outlaws a sector of the market. Some products on the market do not fall within the current framework because they contain a combination of herbal and other ingredients, but as the ingredients are active, those products do not fall within the definition of a food supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it hard to envisage such products, but I have been given some examples of combinations that would not normally be regarded as medicines— products that have no physiological effect and can be sold as foods provided that no medicinal claims are made: garlic and nutrients, artichokes and nutrients, and saw palmetto and nutrients. Nothing in the traditional herbal medicines directive would change the classification of those products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples of combination products that the MCA would currently normally classify as medicinal on the basis of the medicinal nature of the herbal ingredients are echinacea plus vitamins, horse chestnut fruit plus vitamins, and St John's wort plus vitamins. Those products would currently require a marketing authorisation, because they contain active herbal ingredients that have a physiological effect, so we are imposing no extra burden on them. In future, however, producers using some of those ingredients, if they are registered, will be able to claim that they are beneficial and therapeutic, and will therefore be able to market their products more robustly. Manufacturers look forward to some aspects of the directive: they know that, as long as they conform to the licensing framework, they will be able to take a step they have wanted to take for a long time and bring herbal remedies from the periphery into the mainstream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westbury asked whether the Minister knew of any health problems caused by traditional herbal medicines. Medical literature refers to case studies and examples, but it is not easy for Members to gain access to the information. If this is an important part of the justification for regulation in the area, as I believe it is—especially when claims of health benefits are made—will the Minister and her Department put that information into the public domain, and conduct a literature search in both that area and the area of food supplements, which is also coming down the line? Will she ask her Department to produce such a study, which would not take long given the Cochrane library and other facilities, and place it in the Library?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say to hon. Members that although I have not got wide-ranging information at my fingertips, I do have some examples. I have been told that in Belgium more than 100 women suffered renal failure after taking aristolochia, and many of them are now developing cancer. There have also been concerns about creams containing steroids, and I am happy to write to members of the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that guidance on the MCA website gives general advice to consumers on specific safety issues. There is a long section on kava kava, which is currently under consideration after reports of liver damage associated with its use. Indeed, there is information about aristolochia, St. John's wort, side effects and interactions when herbs are used with other medications and the mistaken identity of herbal ingredients to which I referred earlier with regard to the substitution of gentian for podophyllum and digitalis for plantain. Extensive information is already on the MCA website, and Members will obviously have access to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the way in which she has outlined her view of the law on combination products has not given us the full picture? One of the proposals before us is the Commission's intention to change the definition of medicines
	<br><q><p>"to avoid any doubt as to the applicable legislation, when a product whilst fully falling within the definition of a medicinal product may also fall within the definition of other regulated products."</p></q>
Is it not true that she and the Commission seek to bring under the medicinal umbrella many products that have been regulated under other jurisdictions? What she has said about the existing law not being changed in any way is contradicted by the proposed new paragraph in article 2(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I have previously said that we strongly oppose the effect of those provisions when taken together because they will create a hierarchy of medicines, whereas everything that is a medicine has to be regulated as such. We believe that, where items are properly regulated elsewhere, the regulatory framework ought to apply. When we have good law that provides public safety and confidence, we should rely on it. At the moment, we do not have sufficiently robust quality standards to give the public the confidence that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to press the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who kept speaking about national standards and national issues. As I understand the briefing notes, the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales will have authority for legislation there, as will the Northern Ireland Assembly, except it will not have control of the implementation of the legislation. What will happen if any of the devolved Assemblies do not implement the legislation? Can we assume that the negotiations with Europe will be carried through by the Westminster Parliament, and implemented and perhaps enforced in

the United Kingdom with a degree of alacrity and effectiveness that will not be seen in other kingdoms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. This is, of course, an EU directive, and as such it is a reserved matter for the Westminster Parliament. EU directives, of course, have a national remit. In that respect, what we are talking about applies across all the devolved Administrations, although they are of course closely involved in discussions in which they give their views, which consist of an agreed position that we take from the UK to negotiations of that type. The devolved Administrations know all about the directive. They have fed in their views directly to the UK team, and we shall negotiate on the basis of the directive applying across all countries, but in some cases being administered in the regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made much of the fact that the British Herbal Medicine Association supports the directive. In the words of Mandy Rice-Davies, "They would, wouldn't they?", as producers of licensed medicines already have licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask hon. Members to keep their questions short, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that, as the holders of licences for medicines, they would be keen to have a measure that puts competitors out of business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to be fair in my comments. There are many different interests: manufacturers, retailers, consumers and public health officials. We have tried to get the balance right. The directive is not in the business of outlawing products that can be shown to be useful and effective and that should be made available to the public. The directive is not about a closed shop; it is about ensuring that herbal medicines are widely available to consumers in a safe, proper manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that many members of the British Herbal Medicine Association produce unlicensed as well as licensed medicines. The association does not represent a vested interest, because its members produce the whole range of medicines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting closer to finding the evidence base for the regulations. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for producing evidence. May I ask about the UK Government's ad hoc group on vitamins and minerals in the context of setting safe upper limits, because that is very important work, without which it is difficult to consider the directive. I understand that the group will be reporting soon—I am not sure when—and it seems that we are putting the cart before the horse by discussing the directive before we have the results of its deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure whether the hon. Gentleman is referring to food supplements. Negotiations are taking place about the maximum limits that can be supplied in such products. If he is, I am happy to tell him that we are pressing hard for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
maximum limits, on the basis of safety, rather than the lower levels that many other member states want. We are pressing positively to ensure maximum consumer choice while still providing adequate health protection. The maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in supplements sold under food law should be limited only if it is necessary for safety reasons. We agree with consumers in that respect and are pressing very hard to ensure that the position is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is trying to reassure us in many ways that things will not change too much and that we will not see the shelves denuded of products with which we are familiar, but how does that square with the 30-year qualifying period for products without proof of efficacy? The proposal is that products must have been used in the EU for 30 years or for 15 years outside the EU plus 15 years inside. What about products that have been in use for 29 years, or new traditional products that are developed? There will be new herbal products. Where will they fall? What will happen to new products?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to set up a registration scheme that, as far as possible, meets the key balance between maintaining confidence and safety, and choice and access to remedies that people value. Inevitably, it will be a balance. In setting up any regulatory scheme, lines must be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is that the period should be 30 years for traditional remedies, and we have said that up to 15 of the 30 years can relate to use outside the EU. I understand that in negotiating the terms of the directive, it may be possible to press for more regard to be given to non-EU use. I am very conscious of the fact that traditional Chinese and ayurvedic medicines have a long and respectable history of developing remedies, and that may well be an issue. Clearly, if medicines are to be regarded as traditional, a period must be set in which a tradition can be established for people to be able to rely on that traditional use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the comments of the Under-Secretary of State for Health that were given to the European Scrutiny Committee, she expressed some concern about the general shift in the legislation from a balanced approach, with centralised procedure and mutual recognition procedure being seen as pretty much even, to a strong movement towards centralised procedure. Some concerns have been expressed about that, and I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would outline a little more fully exactly what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right. As I understand it, that was one of the main reasons why the Committee was concerned to have a closer look at some of the provisions. I think that they relate to several areas. The Commission requires that all new active substances be authorised under the centralised procedure. At the moment, centralised procedure covers only 2 per cent, of existing medicines, which is a tiny proportion. It is more cumbersome than the mutual recognition procedure because the centralised procedure requires that there be two member states with a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur, who carry out the scientific assessment, which provides a licence for everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
The companies may not want to market some substances in particular areas. That will be a commercial decision depending on the development of the market, the needs of a particular community, cultural differences and all those sorts of issues. We therefore oppose any proposal that all new active substances should come through the centralised procedure. We think that companies should continue to have the choice of the mutual recognition procedure, which is less burdensome and allows an incremental approach by granting approval in specific areas where new substances can continue to be developed. There is that shift to the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned about the make-up of the committees that will oversee the matter. At the moment, we have two representatives from each member state on the European committee, which makes 30 members from member states, and there is a proposal to reduce that to just four members from member states. We feel that is far too small a representation. We must not forget that the system is based on member states doing the scientific analysis and bringing their particular view to the centre, which co-ordinates the analysis. However, it is not the centre that carries out the work, and we want to resist that sort of shift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also proposals for representation of industry on the board, which again causes us some concern. Of course we want to get wider views, but we do not feel it is appropriate for the industry to be on the board of the regulatory body that regulates it. The Government have several concerns; we shall press to retain the choice of routes, and to retain a more inclusive representation for member states in the machinery that approves the medicines through the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consumers for Health Choice, which the Under-Secretary abbreviates to CHCs—rather alarming, given her record on CHCs—in its letter dated 7 June raised the concern that the traditional herbal medicines directive
	<br><q><p>"would end all product innovation and development, including the introduction of any safe new ingredients in the future: even were such products able to comply with the pharmaceutical standards in the Directive."</p></q>
Will she explain what she thinks lies behind that concern, and what is her response to it? The organisation says that the proposed manufacturing and testing standards are inappropriate for herbal remedies, which should not be treated in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs. That is one point, but it has also said that, even if the industry were able to comply with the pharmaceutical standards, they would stifle innovation and development. That is worrying. Does the Under-Secretary know what that is about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have attempted to say, the standards have been specifically designed with herbal medicines in mind. They seek to ensure purity of ingredients, lack of contamination, suitable premises and appropriate equipment. I do not understand how the directive will stifle innovation. It will ensure that products are produced to a high quality, and will end the almost perverse incentive by which those who do not comply with basic quality standards can still get
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
their products into the market. In future, they will have to comply with basic quality standards. That is not about stifling innovation, but ensuring that those with good ideas introduce them in a way that meets proper and necessary standards. I reassure the public that efficacious innovations will have the same access to the licensing procedure as any other product. I am concerned that the campaign has sought to raise unjustified worries among the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one of the two explanatory memorandums issued by the two Departments, doubt is expressed about the legal base of the regulation, and, under the heading "subsidiarity", about the

If any other details become available, I will gladly write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for another chance to ask the Under-Secretary of State for Health about the various hoops that suppliers will have to go through to provide to the market without so-called proof of efficacy—a euphemism for huge costs. The danger is that if many herbal remedies are not able to meet the requirements because they have not been in use in the EC for 30 years—or for 15 years in the EC and for 15 years elsewhere—it is inevitable, despite her reassurances, that without continuation arrangements they will fall and will be subject to a new regime which will be so tough that many will not pass the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns. The purpose of the directive, however, is to provide to herbal remedies an alternative route to the traditional medical model of efficacy, which involves double-blind randomised controlled trials, to allow them to gain widespread standing. That is why the directive includes a traditional element. Although some products may not be able to prove themselves effective in the traditionally hard and detailed way, it must still be recognised that herbal remedies are often effective and that their effectiveness could be based on the traditional element of their usage. The compilation of the dossier, the bibliography, an expert report and its background are all important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A product that can prove efficacy neither in a normal medical way nor in a traditional way will struggle to prove that it is of value at all or able to meet the needs of consumers. It is right that products have to prove that they are useful. We have promoted that to ensure that herbal remedies can find an alternative route through the system, which recognises their different background and the way in which they have evolved. The element of tradition is therefore important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One concern with the directive relates to a case in which two traditional medicinal products may individually comply with the directive and be exempt, but when they are combined they may cease to be exempt and require a marketing authorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the traditional herbal directive relates to exactly that subject—herbal ingredients. Non-herbal ingredients will fall outside its scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the notes, the Minister herself raises the same concern about the combining of two traditional active herbal ingredients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister wish to respond?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I must have misheard the hon. Gentleman. I thought he was talking about a combination of herbal and non-herbal ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the combination itself must be traditional. The way in which different ingredients react with each other could be an issue, because the ingredients will not be seen in isolation: any medicine will be a combination of different ingredients. It is the combination that must be traditional if the alternative route of authorisation is to be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted to questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 13361/01, Commission Report on the experience gained as a result of the operation of the procedures for granting marketing authorisations for medicinal products; and No. 14591/01, draft Regulation laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and veterinary medicinal products; supports the Government's position of broad agreement to the proposed amendments, and the overall aims of the Review; supports the Government's ongoing work with Member States to build on the current system of medicines regulation to ensure it continues to contribute to the protection of human and animal health, also to promote the further development of a single market in pharmaceuticals, prepare the regulatory regime for enlargement, and provide a competitive environment for the pharmaceutical industry; notes European Union Document No. 6240/02, draft Directive amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards traditional herbal medicinal products for human use; and supports the Government's position of broad agreement to the proposed amendments in order to achieve a regulatory regime for traditional herbal medicines which improves public health protection while maintaining consumer choice.—[	<i>Mr. Morley.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>5.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taken together, the provisions involve a major change in the way in which medicines for humans and for animals are dealt with in Europe. Let us start with the report on the operation of the marketing authorisation procedures, which appears to conclude that the dual system of centralised and mutual-recognition authorisation has worked quite well. The actual conclusion, however, is that major reform is required—that the scope of the centralised system must be extended massively, and that the fast-track procedures and all the committees must be restructured in the way described by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is presented as a method of speeding things up and making them more efficient. The centralised authorisation system, however, is a very cumbersome beast. It is hard to see how the logic has led to the proposals that we are discussing. The effect, surely,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
will be a substantial shift of power from member states to the centre, which I think should cause us some concern. It is heartening that Ministers themselves have expressed concern in paragraphs 3.17 to 3.20 of the report. I know it is difficult to do this when answering questions, but perhaps the Minister could put the position in context when she replies to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 3.18, Ministers express concern about our
	<br><q><p>"ability to maintain effective regulatory bodies"</p></q>
if the changes are made. They fear that if centralised authorisations are handed out to an enlarged membership of the European Union, each country will deal with comparatively few, and less work of that kind will be contracted to the regulatory bodies, while the amount of mutual-recognition work will also be much reduced. Does the Minister think she should be fighting harder?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.19 lists various shortcomings that seem quite important. The Ministers' first concern is that
	<br><q><p>"the shortening of the period for assessment"</p></q>
might affect public health. I will not go into it now, but, as the Minister knows, we have major public health problems in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect on compassionate medicines is also referred to. On such aspects as
	<br><q><p>"product characteristics, patient information and packaging",</p></q>
the effect of the proposals may be to fail adequately
	<br><q><p>"to take account of … national markets and differences in prescribing habits".</p></q>
The Under-Secretary of State for Health will see the other points that are made, which she obviously knows well because they are her concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must more adequately explain what they are going to do about those matters. If they are worried about the shift of power and the other important issues, we need to know how the battle is going with our partners in Europe and try to achieve a better result. That is the first matter on which I would like the help of the Under-Secretary of State for Health. Will she go further in giving us information about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second area of concern is the definitional point that I raised earlier, on what exactly the directive on medicines covers. The Commission's proposal is that there should be a definitional change,
	<br><q><p>"to avoid any doubt as to the applicable legislation, when a product whilst fully falling within the definition of a medicinal product may also fall within the definition of other regulated products".</p></q>
It then suggests an amendment to article 2.2, which would drag products that have previously been regulated as foods under the umbrella of medicinal regulation. Will that mean that regulations on both aspects, food and medicines, apply to those products? That is obviously the understanding of the law, for which the Government are arguing, but it has been an area of doubt. Is that area of doubt the basis on which the Under-Secretary of State for Health is confidently saying that all combination medicines are illegal unless
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
they have a marketing authorisation? If that is correct, it has not previously been enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are those changes in definition needed, if the law is as the Under-Secretary of State for Health has told us? Why is it necessary to change the wording of the actual definition from:
	<br><q><p>"Any substance or combination of substances which may be administered to human beings"</p></q>
to a modified text that reads
	<br><q><p>"may be used in human beings"?</p></q>
Is the effect of that to widen the number of products being covered? In what way does it widen that and why? Is it really necessary for the balance, which the Minister mentioned, to be changed so that we undertake more, and much wider, regulation on the medicines side, which is a very expensive procedure? That question of definition is my second area of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third matter about which I want to ask the Under-Secretary of State for Health is the traditional herbal medicine products directive itself. She mentioned balance. It is, of course, true that if there are huge amounts of regulation, we think that we are very safe, but the effect is that there are fewer medicinal products available because the more we regulate the more it costs to bring a product to market, so the fewer products there will be. That stifles innovation and we end up with fewer medicines than might otherwise be the case, and therefore less safety. It is a foolish argument that very heavy regulation in the medical field is always the answer. However, we need enough regulation to ensure that people are safe, so a balance is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the hon. Gentleman so far and, clearly, the more one regulates, the more that could stifle innovation because it leads to major barriers. That may well reduce people's opportunities to be cured. However, he said that that impacted on safety. Those are two different issues. One can regret a reduction in the number of potential treatments available, but that is different from saying that a reduced number of treatments because of more regulation will inherently be less safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rationing health can be a complicated and semantic discussion if we want it to be. The fact of the matter is that the more we regulate—we see examples of that all the time in the health field—the longer it takes for products to become available to patients. More patients are, therefore, not cured and may possibly die. They consider that as a safety issue, but I accept that that means their personal safety. Clearly, if one is injured or dying, one's safety has been impaired. One can make a semantic distinction, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerns on the proposed directive have been raised by the Health Food Manufacturers' Association, Consumers for Health Choice, the Health and Diet company, Holland and Barrett, and almost everyone involved in this field, with the exception of those who hold licences for medicines— it would affect their competitive position in quite a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
positive way. The first point is that herbal products alone are quite a limited category. Many traditional Chinese and ayurvedic medicines include food nutrients as well. Is the Under-Secretary saying that there is a good reason why such safe and popular products should not be available to the public and why they should not be dealt with under the proposed directive? Why does it have to be herbals only?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if one has to establish that the combination of herbs in the product has been together and in use for 30 years, that is a very long period. Many traditional herbs could qualify under the directive but would seem to be outside the statement of the directive itself, if put in combination with another herb that qualifies under the directive. The Under-Secretary herself has expressed concern about the situation. In paragraph 4.7 of the Scrutiny Committee report, she tells us that she will be seeking clarification on
	<br><q><p>"the proposed positive list of herbal substances, where it appears unclear how the arrangements would work in a number of likely situations (for example, if several ingredients contained separately on the positive list were to be combined within one product."</p></q>
Clearly, the Government are saying that they want to seek clarification and pursue the matter. Is the Under-Secretary telling us that that is not the case and that she is not worried that perfectly safe herbal combinations might not be made available? Surely she has a position on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Under-Secretary accept that 15 years would be a more promising time limit? That is partly because 15 years is used in other contexts in the European Union, and it is quite a substantial period. She mentioned that she was flexible about periods of use outside the EU. What is her negotiating position? What is she arguing for as regards the length of time outside the Community in which traditional use can be established?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry's view is that the ingredients should be covered by the directive, rather than the products, because that method is very inflexible. What detail is available to us about the quality and safety standards that will be put forward for registration under the traditional medicine directive? Do we know whether there will be a light or heavy hand of regulation? Will industry and consumers be listened to? What can the Under-Secretary tell us about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been several other points. In the UK and other member states, several herbal products were granted full licences under the directive at the time of the herbal review. Will the Under-Secretary explain the interaction between licensed and registered products? How will the consumer differentiate between them? Will we be able to explain to consumers the difference between a licensed and a registered product? Clearly, if the Minister sees benefits, one of them must be that consumers can rely on a registered herbal product. In that context, what will be done to inform the public about the change and what it means for them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 16f deals with the establishment of a positive list of herbal substances that gives
	<br><q><p>"therapeutic indication, specified strength, the route of administration",</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
but the basis for the compilation of the list, which will be extremely important in the practical working of the directive, is not clear. We are told only that it will be set up by a committee referred to in article 16h. Will the Minister tell us about the committee? Who will be on it, where does it come from and where is it going? We would like to know the details. What is it all about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will address another concern, which is about compliance costs. They are referred to at different points in the regulatory assessment as very high, high and medium. The assessment also says that it is too early to say what they will be. Obviously, it is important for business to know the likely scale of the costs that will be involved. What assurance can the Minister give about the costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn for a moment to the agricultural aspects and veterinary medicines. Ministers are concerned that the proposals do not adequately take account of the fundamental nature of animal health markets and that, due to the species-specific regional and often sporadic nature of animal diseases, the markets are, in practice, tiny in comparison with human pharmaceuticals, yet the medicines must be licensed to similar standards of quality, safety and efficacy. They expressed the concern that it would simply not be economically feasible, under such conditions, to bring to market many veterinary medicinal products. The Minister will know that a Conservative spokesman in the European Parliament, Robert Sturdy MEP, also expressed grave concern about the matter:
	<br><q><p>"If we are not successful"</p></q>
in arguing our case—
	<br><q><p>"we can see that it would be possible to use the proposed definition of a veterinary prescription to allow a suitably qualified person other than a vet under the UK's current arrangements to write a prescription and/or distribute a specific category of POM product. We are still considering this option, which of course is one of the recommendations of the independent review."</p></q>
I apologise—that was Lord Whitty's response to him. Perhaps the record could be amended. We said that we saw no justification for the proposal. There is concern about the considerable costs, particularly given the decline in farm incomes, if such medicines are sold only on prescription. Clearly, it would be helpful to farmers if veterinary costs could be kept at a reasonable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to have from the Minister an overview and some specific comments about the definition issue and the whole question of traditional herbal medicines directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us deal quickly with the veterinary point, because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health has many questions to deal with on the human health factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On procedures for scrutiny on the veterinary side, I know that the issue has been referred to the Agricultural and Rural Development Committee of the European Parliament. Indeed, other committees, such as the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy Committee and the Industry,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
External Trade, Research and Energy Committee, are considering aspects of it. All parties in the United Kingdom and other member states share those concerns. The matter will be scrutinised in detail, will then go to the plenary session of the European Parliament in October, and the European Parliament will give its opinion and refer it back to the Council of Ministers. I am sure that those concerns are shared with other countries and we intend to press them strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister and hope that he can change the provision because, first, farmers are hard pressed and it would help them if veterinary costs could be kept within bounds and, secondly, we want the products to be available so that animals do not suffer unnecessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make this point during my speech if I am called. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that he is sure that those on the continent—perhaps I should say in the European Parliament—have similar concerns. I do not believe that that is so, because they live in a much more restricted world with the Code Napoleon and tend to want a more restrictive structure. The French and Germans do not think like us in that respect. A more restrictive code does not sit easily with what we are trying to achieve in this country, where we want a freer code.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the important point that the availability of products that consumers want to use and which have a good safety record is an important interest that we should stand up for. It is important that people can use the products they want to use, unless it can be demonstrated that there is real concern about safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had the Under-Secretary of State for Health been able to point to a substantial body of evidence showing that people are being injured or dying as a result of taking complementary medicines, that would be one thing, but she did not. She gave a few anecdotal examples, whereas she could have produced a substantial medical report to the European Scrutiny Committee had she wanted to. Mistakes can be made in any industry. The products of even the best retailers in the land are occasionally found to contain a hair or some other adverse incident occurs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unfair. My hon. Friend made it clear that some of the examples were given by the MCA, which is an independent and extremely reputable organisation. Hon. Members can examine its website.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth stressing that, in addition to the fact that many organisations involved in herbal medicines in their own countries support the directive, our own Consumers Association generally supports it. That association is much better known to me than Consumers for Choice, which has strong links with industry and vested interests. I have much more confidence in the Consumers Association on issues such as this than in some of the campaigning groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that I have not explained my view clearly enough, although I have probably gone on about it for a long time. We are not saying that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
should not be regulation in this area. We would like it to be the right level of regulation to ensure that products are available and safe. We want the Minister to start to fight for consumers and the hundreds of thousands of people involved in retailing the products in this country in such a way that the widest possible variety of herbal remedies is available without the Code Napoleon approach to which my hon. Friend referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am about to make applies not solely to complementary medicines, but also to conventional medicines. All such products have a good safety record until they do not. It is not good enough to say that, unless there is evidence of harm, they can be assumed to be safe. The problem is that health claims are made for the products, which are marketed at vulnerable consumers. Some effort must be made to demonstrate safety as far as possible within limited trials—huge populations cannot be covered in trials—to obtain some support. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am concerned about the extent of the trials, but they provide a let-out for years of experience. The point on which I wanted to take issue with him is the argument that those products have a good safety record; all products have a good safety record until they do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously correct, but the Ministers and the hon. Gentleman already accept that if a product has been used safely over an extended period, that is one way in which to show its efficacy. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall come to safety, which is important, in a moment. The other way of showing efficacy is to conduct trials, but they are very expensive and if a traditional medicine has existed for a long time, that is one way of proving its efficacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as medical evidence is concerned, I downloaded the MCA's view from its website, which includes a passage headed, "additional MCA comment". It lists a few examples of cases in which products have not been as they should. My point is that nobody would describe that as a detailed medical assessment of complementary medicines, and it is not supposed to be. They are a few anecdotal examples that have been put forward to justify the Minister's case. Those are the areas on which we should like to hear more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Iddon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be as brief as possible, although I have a lot to say. My interest in the subject comes from my constituency, in which the Health and Diet Food company has a fairly large presence. It took over a small family business, which occupied one shed on an industrial site, five or six years ago and it now occupies five sheds, which shows how quickly it has developed over the past five years. We can see how popular that industry has become on every high street. I can tell my hon. Friends that a lot of emotion surrounds the products that we are discussing this afternoon. If we dare to take one such product off the shelves, we may not cause a riot but we will create a lot of problems. That takes me back to the fracas that we entered into in the 1997–98 Parliament on vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 took over my life. Later, along came a directive like the one that we are discussing this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
afternoon called MLX249. I never believed that I would talk in Trafalgar square to hundreds of people about MLX249. I would have believed that that could happen on the subject of cannabis, but not MLX249.1 was astonished at the number of people who came out to march down Park lane to Trafalgar square on an issue that I thought was not important. If hon. Members feel that the issues are not important, they are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is growing—I have no other interest in the industry apart from the company in my constituency. The two principles on which the industry bases itself are the safety of its products—I accept that there have been some difficulties, which have been mentioned, but overall it has a good safety record—and choice of and access to products. My concern is that the industry is being bombarded with directives; I have already mentioned MLX249 and the vitamin B6 fracas. Three directives are going through the European Parliament, and experts in the field have told me that there are more to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that many companies in the industry are not like Holland and Barrett, which could probably withstand the bombardment of directives. Many are small family businesses, and if they have to take on board and implement all the new regulations, they will go out of business; it is as simple as that. Many such companies have hundreds of years of tradition of supplying herbal products and food supplements, and I am therefore concerned about the industry's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a deregulation unit somewhere in Parliament, and it is supposed to be deregulating. The number of regulations that are flying at the industry—there are more to come—is frightening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the new definition of a medicine in the medicines directive. It is difficult to define a medicine exactly, but the change in article 1 from the words "administered to human beings" to "used in human beings" is wide, flawed and could result in problems. We know why the European Union has done it: it wants to bring on board many other products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulations will also bring confusion. Even if a product were on the market under the provisions, for example, of the PARNUTS legislation, the proposed food supplements directive, the proposed addition of nutrients to food directive or other Community food laws, the medicines legislation could in future require it to be considered as a medicine. An enormous swathe of legislation has gone before, and now we are introducing new legislation. How is a small family company to cope with it all? It will be impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We risk the removal of many safe and popular natural health products from general retail sale by requiring them to comply with medicines legislation that demands a demonstration of efficacy. I have always opposed bringing herbal products and medicines under the same legislative procedures and under the Medicines Control Agency. The MCA does a terrific job and is fully conversant with the pharmaceutical industry, its medical trials and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
efficacy, but I maintain that herbal products are not pharmaceuticals. They are quite different. A single active ingredient is involved in trialling a pharmaceutical product, but the trialling of herbal substances with medical properties, if it is required, is much more difficult. I have always argued that we should have separate legislation for borderline products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an argument for the hon. Gentleman's proposal, but separate legislation will still create a borderline between medicines legislation and his proposed legislation. The creation of a new category does not solve that problem. The key question is whether something that makes medicinal claims is thoroughly tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Iddon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Traditional herbal products have been tested for far longer than any modern pharmaceuticals. Some of them have been used for centuries, and we have not seen large numbers of people dying as a result. I was brought up in a village in the 1940s, and the number of pharmaceuticals that were available then could be counted on two hands, and they had to be paid for. In every village, there was somebody who knew how to deal with a physiological condition using a herbal product. Those traditions go back hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years, and their safety and efficacy have been clearly demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand why we have the 30-years rule and why the word "traditional" is in the directive. However, the directive appears to carry sway on the word "products". I think that we should use the term, "herbal ingredients". In the past few decades, a range of innovative products have been put on the market that fall outside the scope of the 30-years rule—they contain traditional herbal ingredients but in new products, which will be caught by the legislation. The directive will fly in the face of innovation, for which the industry has become well known, especially over the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is the regulatory impact assessment that was applied to the directive. The industry representatives who have come to me have greatly criticised the way in which that assessment was carried out. They argue that there are many flaws in it and say that they have not been properly consulted. Other hon. Members have referred to the lack of consultation with the industry—with the people actually manufacturing the products, not the trade representatives of the industry. I put it to the Ministers that there has been a lack of consultation with the companies producing the products, rather than with the trade organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would frankly prefer the legislation to be deferred for a few months, or perhaps a year, so that we can look at it again, consult the industry properly and ensure that what we are introducing is watertight. Three kinds of companies operate in the industry. First, there are companies that are not large. I mention Potters of Wigan, in an adjacent constituency to mine, because I happen to know it quite well. It has been manufacturing such products for decades. It has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
licenses for that, which it obtained under quite different legislation many years ago. It is not going to be caught and it is quite small. Secondly, there are many companies such as Holland and Barrett that have bottom lines that could probably withstand the impact of such directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most concerned about the third group of companies: small specialist companies that will be trapped in the middle and hit hard by this directive and the others that are coming at them. I repeat my request to the Ministers that we get down to much better consultation than has so far taken place. When we reach agreements in Europe, we must ensure that we carry the whole UK industry with us, so that we do not get people marching down Park lane and I do not have to turn up in Trafalgar square again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate. I want to focus on the matters about which I have intervened because my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) will be speaking on some of the general issues and because some of the concerns clearly held by the Liberal Democrats have been expressed in the European Parliament. They include concerns about the scope of the regulations and such particular issues as whether two ingredients that are both herbal, or two herbal products taken together, will gain exemption— a point that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire made well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word on safety and efficacy in products that make medicinal claims. Let me make it clear again that my concerns about that extend not just to herbal, or what are called complementary, medicines but to pharmaceutical products. The same arguments apply to them and they must not be let off the hook. The first thing to say is that safety is an issue and the normal way of testing for safety as best one can is to indulge in human volunteer trials, at least at the end of the process. That is where safety problems are sought because, when using a product for general use, one does not submit oneself to a battery of blood tests, liver function tests, scans and symptom questionnaires. Safety problems are very difficult to detect until they are huge, unless they are specifically sought in a well-designed research trial. That is why the hurdles for safety are high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything in life carries some risk but, as a society, we put a higher premium on safety when products are marketed as having medicinal benefit because they are being marketed to vulnerable people, many of whom are desperate for a cure or for symptom relief. One can argue that extra protection in the pharmaceutical industry is provided by the barrier to access that is the requirement of a prescriber and by a second barrier— although the Committee might be discussing this in the future—which is the current ban on direct-to-consumer advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in areas such as those that we are discussing, where, for historical reasons, there is less safety data, there are far fewer restrictions on advertising to consumers who are just as vulnerable. We must therefore be clear, when we talk about safety,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
that we not only talk, but say what we mean. That means asking those seeking to market a product and profit from it, in both sectors—orthodox and so-called complementary—to ensure that safety trials are done. That is a different issue from efficacy. I think that there was, towards the end of the otherwise very interesting and sensible remarks of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, a confusion between the question of efficacy and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that many products turn out not to be safe in the long run. They are always on the front page of the newspapers as scandals, and we should accept that it will always be that way. As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure that we put as many barriers to unsafe products coming on to the market as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On efficacy, to a certain extent it does not matter when marketing some products whether they work or not. There are issues of advertising and trading standards, but when it comes to products that make therapeutic claims, as opposed to food supplements that do not, it is reasonable to insist on some evidence of efficacy. I question whether experience alone, even over many years, is in itself sufficient evidence of efficacy. Bleeding was used for hundreds of years in this country—it was used more recently when I was a junior doctor taking blood, unintentionally—as a potential treatment for various maladies. Of course, we know that often the patient died not from the illness, but from lack of blood due to the treatment. Simply counting the years without doing trials of effectiveness, and looking for those trials, preferably randomised double-blind control trials where possible—a little hobby horse of mine—will make it very difficult to show that there has been efficacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is a difficulty because consumers have been using a product that they find helpful, which may be because it is helpful, or because they think that it is. The placebo effect is valid, and modern medicine relies on it to a certain extent in the non-complementary field. Therefore, the proposal is a compromise. When there has been safe use for many years of products that make medicinal claims, one can say that they are efficacious enough to be advertised to vulnerable consumers as having a medicinal effect. However, we have to accept that that is a compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned in my questions, the Consumers for Health Choice document is concerned that the regulations would end all product innovation and development, including the introduction of any safe new ingredients—presumed safe, it ought to say—that pharmaceutical companies should state for their products, even if such products were able to comply with pharmaceutical standards in the directive. I received that letter only recently, so I was not able to explore with CHC what exactly it meant. I have heard the argument used, and it says in a further document that
	<br><q><p>"the manufacturing and testing standards proposed are inappropriate for herbal remedies which should not be treated in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs."</p></q>
However, it had previously stated that, even if companies were able to comply with those standards, it would stifle innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
The CHC has not explained to me why that is the case. I do not know whether the CHC is funded by the industry. The Under-Secretary felt that it was. It does not say so it is on its letterhead, and I take issue with groups lobbying on pharmaceutical products that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry but do not make that clear. I am assuming that it is not. I would like the Under-Secretary to clarify whether she or other Members have received representations showing why the matter referred to by the CHC would be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have debated with the hon. Member for Bosworth, who is concerned that if one puts standards on complementary areas of therapy, which do not have the capital of the pharmaceutical companies to carry out safety and efficacy trials, one creates insuperable barriers to innovation or retesting. I am not sure whether that is necessarily true because of the size of the market in some of the areas. Some of the companies are major players. Of course, the molecule has already been identified, particularly for existing products, so a limited number of efficacy trials is needed, which can be afforded. The Government should say whether they are willing, as they have done in other areas of industry, to work with players in the field on a partnership basis, perhaps with match funding or support for infrastructure, to allow such trials to proceed. It is very difficult to enter an area in which there is no tradition, because infrastructure, experience and indemnity are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making some sensible remarks, but does he share my concern about what we see on the shelves of shops selling those products? Often no overt claim of efficacy is made on the packaging, but such a claim is made by implication, by word of mouth or in articles in the press. How can the position be clarified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very difficult, and may be outside the scope of this short debate. What worries me is reading in a newspaper "Taking this can help". Well, it might help, but so might going for a swim in the Thames.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make two more points, both of which also apply to conventional medicines. First, I think the Government have missed a trick with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. There is a huge number of conventional products out there which are being used by the NHS day in, day out. If we looked at those products with the benefit of what we know now, we would find that they had no beneficial effect whatever—that taking them would merely involve the risk of adverse effects. There is huge scope for the Government to investigate some of the conventional products on which we spend money. Do they have any effect? If not, they should be unlicensed, as they are being sold on the basis of their efficacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the difficult issue of the therapeutic margin. It would be astonishing if any drug, let alone every traditional herbal drug, were both very good for you and completely safe. That is not the way in which molecules work in physiology. They work in a much more difficult way: their therapeutic effect is often matched, or accompanied, by an adverse effect. I am always sceptical when I hear of a drug that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
is wonderful and completely safe, and has very little in the way of adverse effects. I am extremely sceptical when I hear of such products from the pharmaceutical industry. We should feel the same scepticism when we hear such claims about complementary medicines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arguments also apply to the issue of ingredients versus products. When certain drugs are repackaged, or reformulated, their bio-availability— the ease with which they are absorbed in the body— can change simply because of the way in which they are ingested. What could previously have been considered a safe dose may no longer be safe. Perhaps it does not pass through the liver and is not metabolised or broken down initially, or perhaps it goes through the hepatic portal vein and is hepatotoxic. It is not easy to be certain that if the ingredients are all right, their formulation is also all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government propose regulations such as this and try to make a scientific case, they should do a bit more than directing people to an MCA website. I think there is a medical and scientific case, although I do not think it is free of problems; but I believe that the Government should reach out to Members of Parliament and to the public by demonstrating that there are valid scientific concerns. They should not simply say, "It is a matter for the MCA; look at its website". They should identify themselves with the Department of Health's document setting out the scientific and medical problems associated with the products we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have the impression from many organisations and lobby groups that we have not had enough time for consultation. I claim for my constituency an organisation that has already been claimed by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) for his—the Health and Diet company. More specifically, however, I claim its parent company, Nutricia. It is
	<br><q><p>"firmly of the view that progress on the Directive should be delayed pending a wider consultation and debate about the most appropriate way to regulate herbal remedies."</p></q>
I am getting that impression from the industry, and also from individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there seems to be little support for the proposals at all. We have heard that the British Herbal Medicine Association is supportive, but that is qualified by the fact that many of its members are not happy. More particularly, we understand that the Chinese Medicines Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, Consumers for Health Choice, the National Association of Health Stores, the Health Food Manufacturers Association and the Ayurvedic Medicines Association are unhappy with many parts of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most convincing material that has passed across my desk—there has been a lot of it; all hon. Members will have received a lot—came from a constituent on my patch. If I may crave your
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
indulgence, Mr. Chidgey, I shall read it out. My constituent says:
	<br><q><p>"I am writing to express my alarm at what I have read recently regarding the above directive"—</p></q>
the European directive—
	<br><q><p>"which proposes to ban the sale of certain vitamin supplements and limit the strength of others to RDA doses. My wife and I have been regular users of a number of high dosage vitamin supplements for a number of years and can attest to the help they have been to us. At the age of 74 my gold handicap is going down, not up! I object most strongly to any attempt by authorities to limit my choice in this direction. It seems to me that the large pharmaceutical companies have lobbied strongly for this directive which could put many small health stores in the UK at risk. Should it be brought into force in the country I would still be able to purchase my requirements outside the EU but I do not see that this should be necessary and I trust that common sense will prevail and the Government will not be brow beaten into accepting this directive which is not in the interests of the health of citizens in this country."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am in receipt of many letters from elderly constituents—East Devon has one of the highest pensioner populations in the country. For many people, alternative medicine and herbal remedies prove a highly effective way of keeping them, at the end of the day, out of NHS waiting lists. Is my hon. Friend concerned, as I am, that the whole process that we are debating is undermining people's belief in such alternative sources of medicine and that it will do precisely the reverse of what is intended—throw them back on to the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a very powerful point. That group of products certainly occupies an increasingly large share of the market. Many of those products are probably useful and of benefit to people. At the end of the day, if people think that they are of benefit to them, who are we to say otherwise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect that has not been discussed today is education. That is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be grateful if Members would refrain from entering into private debates while others are speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Chidgey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education on that range of products is important. It would be naive to suppose that the regulations, even as drafted, would cover the great panoply of products that could possibly be regarded as medicinal. I simply cannot conceive that that is the case. We must educate people to be aware that taking products that have not been tested and surveyed in a proper scientific fashion could conceivably carry health risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Medicines come with a guarantee, in that they have been studied and investigated, and we can say with a high degree, although not an absolute level, of confidence that they are safe to take. However, given the multiplicity of combinations, it would be very difficult to say that the products that we are discussing will definitely be safe. We cannot give people that guarantee, but if this legislation were passed and we were to give those products some sort of stamp of approval, we would need to educate people about what that would be telling them. The stamp of approval is not absolute and will not give people the same guarantee that the Medicines Control Agency gives medicines as we currently understand them.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
We must give some focus to education on this range of products. I see little evidence that that is happening at the moment. Certainly, nothing is coming to me from Ministers to suggest that we are making inroads there. We must educate not only consumers, but professionals. I am always amused by the get-out clause that if one is in doubt about a product one should consult one's doctor. Very often, one's doctor is the last person to ask because, particularly in that field, doctors simply do not know. Often, their only recourse is the national poisons unit, a telephone consultation organisation that one can phone up to establish in broad terms the safety or otherwise of a substance. We should give more support to professionals to allow them to advise on the safety of the multiplicity of products available to consumers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Health on taking over this brief from her hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper). Having kept on eye on these matters in the House for the past 15 years, I should like to offer her some advice, building on some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is dealing with an explosive issue. I watched her face as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked a string of relevant questions and was thinking that we have been here before. I remember the then right hon. Member for Perry Barr, who is now Lord Rooker, being arraigned on MLX249—the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is nodding. Before that, we had the terrible debacle over vitamin B6 and the idea, which was blown to pieces, that we should reduce the dose from 100 mg to 20 mg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An inextricable expansion in demand is meeting a perceived restriction in supply. Although the Under-Secretary of State for Health stresses the safety issue, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) said so eloquently, most elderly people see the expansion of choice as a lifeline. It brings down their golf handicaps, but more importantly it keeps them alive. Given that public perception, demand is dramatically on the increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister used the example, which has been used many times, of aristolochia—a difficult word to pronounce. The case in Belgium involved the wrong type of aristolochia being prescribed to the wrong people in the wrong dose. However, one bad case does not make good law. I have given many examples in the House of how conventional medicine kills a large number of people every year. For example, hundreds of people die from aspirin over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall a Westminster Hall debate in which I stressed to her the importance of combination medicines. We looked at Chinese medicine and had a bit of fun. We talked about how the Chinese list their combinations as a chief, a deputy, an assistant and a messenger, which, as we said in that debate, is like the Whips Office. The same argument applies to this issue because we are talking about the right, which is in danger of getting bogged down in all kinds of regulation, to mix and match minerals, herbs
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
and other substances, and we will see a restriction on the number of products in the herbal medicines market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not even touched on the vitamin and supplements directive, which at the last count will take 300 nutrients off the shelves because only 30 products will go through the hugely expensive hoop of being proven as medicines. The Minister's brief is dangerous, and she has a lot of work to do in coming to terms with those complex issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East and I were astonished to find ourselves between the lions underneath Nelson's column in Trafalgar square one Sunday, having marched from Marble arch to Trafalgar square at the head of an angry crowd. It is quite an experience talking in Trafalgar square and it is quite an experience chanting, "Tony, we want the right to choose"—we could be heard in Downing street. The Minister should see the straws in the wind such as the press releases from Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Paul McCartney. A lot of people out there are tooling up for war, and it will be serious. There will be not only correspondence, but marches and rallies. People see a way of life being destroyed, so do not underestimate the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no particular interest in herbal medicines. I have been persuaded only once to partake of some Chinese medicine by my wife; she said that I was overworking and that I needed a little more vigour. I had to take the tablets for three or four days and they were meant to give me a lift. On the list of ingredients—reading lists is always a mistake—was the deputy ingredient of liver of dog. If that did not depress me enough, I then read that the chief ingredient was liver of donkey. At that point, I decided that I did not need a lift and I would make any changes by myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are questions about what we can advise people to eat to give them a lift or make them feel better. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon clearly said that when people make a claim they must be able to justify it. Were an individual to buy a car which the manufacturer said did 100 mph, he would be disappointed if it did only 50 mph, but laws and regulations prevent that from happening. We must be careful in the case of other products that what people are being sold will do what is claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are fears that the practical effect of the proposals will far outstrip their benefits. I have considered examples of good EU legislation. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has debated shell fish quality with me before—we have good legislation on shell fish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to keep to the issue under debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just that, although legislation might be good, legislators in Whitehall can then consider it and complicate it far more than anyone in Europe would. The industry has real fears that, despite the Ministers' good works, we shall end
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
up with something that is far more complex than what exists for our European colleagues, or than what is needed. Civil servants' desire to give us the best, and to gold plate legislation as far as they can, is understandable, but such gold plating can be a bad way in which to approach legislation. I hear what the Ministers say about a minimum, and I hope that they ensure that we go back to Europe and reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not remember whether it was four or six years ago, or whether it was during the time of the Labour Government or the outgoing Conservative Government, but the Department of Health had a real go at introducing legislation just like this. At that time, it said that the EU required us to introduce it. Those in the industry launched a big campaign and said that they did not think that it was necessary. The Department of Health backed down—the battle was too great—and agreed that there was no requirement in EU law, so it would not take on the new proposals. However, because of that, the industry fears that the proposed requirements will be too prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some products may be dangerous when combined with others, but some herbal medicines are not. We take sage out of the garden, boil it up and use it for a cough. We might combine it with other things to improve it. If I were to give that to my neighbour, would I fall foul of the legislation? We need a commonsense approach to many herbal medicines which are tried and tested, and which, when combined with each other, could not be construed as dangerous in any way, shape or form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said about safety and testing was absolutely right, but we must decide what needs to be tested and why. Legislation that provides that everything must be tested would clearly be nonsense, because there are quite clearly products that are safe and usable that should be able to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, let us look at the objectives of the whole package. The Ministers have said that they have doubts and fears. When they go back and negotiate, will they ask what the basis is for many of the proposals and why these matters are being dealt with, and what other structures are being set up and why? The documents that we have been given—it is an overall package of legislation, and it is hard to know what refers to what—mention "objectives". They include the setting up of a legal framework that
	<br><q><p>"favours the competitiveness of the European pharmaceuticals sector".</p></q>
That is the pharmaceutical industry, not the herbal industry. I think that we would all like to see the herbal products industry do well and prosper, and to see that what comes out of the proposals is, in the long term, safe for consumers and for the industry in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said when he opened the debate, we genuinely welcome the opportunity to debate the proposals from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
Commission to amend the European legislation that governs the regulation of human and veterinary medicines and to introduce a directive on traditional herbal medicines. Much of our debate has been on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are complex subjects and I shall take the advice of the hon. Member for Bosworth and of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East, who said that there is a huge amount of public concern about the matter. I do not underestimate that fact. These are matters of great detail and I certainly intend to take them extremely seriously. In our dealings, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I are absolutely concerned to get the balance right between regulation, consumer choice, confidence and safety. Those are all very important to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful and wide-ranging discussion. I thank hon. Members for their contributions, because this is an ongoing debate. I should like to reinforce the Government's position, perhaps with a little more information on how the negotiations are going and on what the Government's stance will be on certain areas as the directives proceed through Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the review of medicines legislation. As we have made clear, the Government support the overall objectives of the Commission's review. We recognise the need to take account of the experience of operating the system introduced in 1995 and to try to make changes to take account of the forthcoming Community enlargement. Some changes will need to be made to the existing committee structure, which will not be tenable after enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific objectives set out by the Commission for the review are laudable—no one would argue otherwise, with an exercise that sets out to guarantee a high level of public health protection for EU citizens and to provide fast access to innovative medicines. Nor would we oppose changes designed to ensure the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in the EU. We are in a strong position, because of the size of our industry, to benefit significantly from proposals that would achieve that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and I have tried to make clear in our discussions today that the Government have concerns about the way in which the Commission has translated its objectives into specific proposals in certain areas. A particular concern—a matter that was raised in passing by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon—is the proposal to have pilot projects on direct-to-consumer advertising in three areas: AIDS, asthma and diabetes. The pilot projects would be on providing information direct to consumers. We do not want to see any pilot project that breaches in any way, however limited, the fundamental principle that prescription medicines may not be advertised to the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally importantly, we do not want an initiative that would prevent us from continuing to develop the good systems of providing proper product information and increasing knowledge to patients so that they are better informed. We are very concerned that a pilot project for five years for a limited range of diseases
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
might prevent us from developing initiatives across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Under-Secretary not support that project? Is it because she does not want people to be better informed? Over-the-counter medicines can be advertised direct to the consumer. Or is she concerned that it might lead to increased demand for such products and make it more difficult for the NHS to get away with the implicit instead of the explicit rationing that is so widespread?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point is the difference between information and advertising. Information to patients is something that we would all support, so that they can make informed choices. That information should be accurate and reliable. There is a world of difference between information and advertising that is designed to maximise take-up of a particular product. Therefore, we strongly oppose direct advertising of particular products and various claims that they might make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have concerns about another matter that has not been raised in the debate, but I want to emphasise it. It is proposed to abolish the five-yearly licence renewals and replace them with three-yearly safety reports. We think that the five-yearly licence renewals provide a much more robust mechanism for looking at the licence generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire about centralisation and how we propose to deal with the issue in the negotiations is very important. We do not believe that making a centralised procedure mandatory for all new active substances will improve the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical industry, nor provide fast access to innovative medicines for the citizens of Europe. In fact, it might have the opposite effect and make the EU, especially after enlargement, a less attractive place in which to develop and market new drugs. If companies have to go through the central procedure, they may be more reluctant to market in the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also believe that requiring companies to prepare every product for each of the 25 member states, with all the language implications and other obligations of the centralised procedure before it can be marketed anywhere in the EU, is an unwarranted hurdle for new medicines, which may delay access for citizens. In any event, the use of that procedure does not mean that a product has to be marketed in every member state. A company might decide not to do so, and the product would not be available even when it has got over all the hurdles of the centralised procedure. The proposal would seriously disadvantage the veterinary sector, in which the range of species and diseases is such that many veterinary medicines are just not needed in every single member state. We shall press that issue extremely hard in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire that we have pressed an argument for no change to the scope of the centralised procedure, and we are making progress. The balance of member states' views is in favour of the UK view to maintain the status quo, so companies would still have a choice whether to go through the central procedure or the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
mutual recognition procedure. We will continue strongly to promote our views; that is a high priority for the UK Government. There is some evidence that certain Members of the European Parliament, who were generally very disposed to the idea of centralised procedure, are reconsidering their support for further centralisation. I am pleased to be able to tell all hon. Members that that appears to be going our way in the negotiations, but we shall continue to press the matter extremely hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change to the definition of a medicinal product and the extension of the scope of medicine legislation is another important issue on which we will continue to press the Commission. We of course accept the need to ensure that so-called borderline products can be identified and, where necessary in the interests of public health, appropriately regulated as medicines. However, such a provision should not undermine perfectly acceptable legislation already in place to regulate a range of products such as food supplements, medical devices and others. Again, we will press very hard on those issues to ensure that we do not create a hierarchy of medicines that we do not believe would be helpful to us.

On the traditional herbal medicinal products directive, it is not surprising that MPs and constituents have been raising issues, because there has been a very big campaign. I would like to reassure Members that there are other views apart from those that have been heard most vociferously in the debate. As I say, 1 million leaflets have been published and I am concerned that people have received inaccurate information as a result of that campaign. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon raised a concern as to whether Consumers for Health Choice is funded by the industry. I understand from its documents, which it has issued in Parliament, that it receives donations from its members and independent retailers. It also receives "generous campaign support" for its existing UK and Brussels work from leading companies such as Holland and Barrett, Solgar and Biocare, which are prominent brands in the UK. It estimates the cost of the UK roll-out of its public relations campaign at $100,000, and is looking for total campaign funding of $340,000. It is important that that should be placed on the record.

The directive will put in a place a systematic regime that will recognise the value of traditional herbal remedies. It will give such remedies a secure legal status, bring long-term stability to the market and assure the consumer of quality, safety, information and choice. Those are major advantages, and it would be short-sighted to spurn that opportunity. We are encouraged that many other member states appear to share that view. They have recently indicated that they too welcome the proposals in the directive, and we shall continue actively to participate in continuing negotiations. As I have said, it may be possible during the drafting of the text to improve the directive to set out more clearly how account can be taken of herbal traditions from outside the EU, accepting that there is a long history of Chinese and ayurvedic medicines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that she will do everything that she can to make sure that the numbers of herbs available on the market remains the same? Will she focus on the need to maintain the existing market and not allow availability to be severely restricted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the positive list that is being drawn up of herbal substances will set out the parameters for the use of medicines, dosages and formulations. I have to draw a line, however, at the mix-and-match approach suggested by the hon. Member for Bosworth. He said that we need the right to mix and match herbs, vitamins and minerals to make sure that there is a range of products. I draw a line at the mix-and-match approach because we must be sure that substances are safe. We must be sure that issues about safety and effectiveness are properly covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who usefully has a medical background, set out the way in which substances taken in combination can have a different effect from individual substances. When substances are taken in different formulations, the way in which they are ingested can have a different effect on the body. We have to be very careful and not simply jump to the conclusion that because one ingredient is deemed to be safe and acceptable, a range of combinations involving that ingredient would have the same safety and effectiveness. We have to insert a note of caution about going down that path. As I stated previously, there is support for the directive from companies involved in the field. Those companies have both licensed and unlicensed medicines, and it is important to stress that the issue is not simply about protecting their market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a wider issue, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked about the role of the advisory committee, which will be part of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines. It will have two main functions: it will be responsible for establishing herbal monographs to look at the bibliography and background for drawing up a positive list of substances; and it will also be responsible for setting up and maintaining the list of substances for which applicants do not need to demonstrate safety and traditional use. It will provide a support mechanism, search out evidence and provide the positive list. I understand that each member state will nominate a member of the committee. The term of office will be three years and will be renewable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"Due to the dissimilar situation of herbal medicinal products in the Member States, which cannot immediately be harmonised in its entirety by the new provisions, the mutual recognition procedure…cannot be applied to registrations of traditional herbal medicinal products."</p></q>
Why is that, and what does it mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a proposal for a mutual recognition procedure so that substances that had been registered in one member state could be mutually recognised across the EU. However, because of the background and the way in which products have emerged, it will not be possible for that to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
There is a precedent with homeopathic medicines, for which a register has been established. Again, there is a problem with mutual recognition of homeopathic medicines because of the different traditions in which they have emerged. Therefore, although the UK will have a registration system for products, mutual recognition will not be possible because of the different ways that the industry has emerged in different member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the product must be registered in each individual state? That seems awfully burdensome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Blears</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that would be the case because, obviously, the field is very unregulated. We are just beginning to take the first steps towards regulation. Therefore, to preserve safety and protection, mutual recognition will not be possible at present. A substance may be registered here, but the way in which the industry developed in another member state may have resulted in entirely different products, formulations and combinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took a long time for traditional pharmaceuticals to receive widespread recognition. We started the Europe-wide mutual recognition scheme in 1995 for pharmaceutical medicines, but we are at the early stages of recognising herbal medicine. It will be some time yet before we are in a position to have the same degree of trust in alternative medicines, whether homeopathic or herbal, which would enable Europe-wide mutual recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked how the products will be labelled. Traditional herbal medicines that are registered under the directive will have a clear, agreed label stating that the medical indication is based on traditional use. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East mentioned the interesting precedent of Canada, which has a borderline regulatory regime. Other Members indicated that at some point a borderline would have to be drawn and that we would argue about the parameters. We are genuinely concerned not to generate more bureaucracy in this process. Having to make yet more decisions about where a separate regulatory regime would interface with this one would create even more complication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge asked us to ensure that we take a minimalist approach to the changes that appear in the regulations. I assure him that, as the regulations go through the process, we will make the point very clearly that we envisage a strong role for member states. We shall resist the move to centralisation and the resultant bureaucracy. The overall objectives are about competitiveness—it is very important for us to pursue that. The hon. Gentleman gave an example of a do-it-yourself remedy. I just point out that do-it-yourself remedies from the garden are very different from the remedies of a company marketing a product with therapeutic claims. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has recovered his vigour and is feeling well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to the necessity of ensuring that there is evidence of efficacy in medicines. We are trying,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
through the traditional-use route, to give people an alternative to the randomised trials to which he referred, recognising that there are different ways of looking at such matters. However, we must always be conscious of the need for an evidence base, so we want to set up dossiers and obtain expert reports, bibliography, information about the background of herbal literature and so on, and to trawl as widely as possible to find out which products can make a difference to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westbury expressed concern about the time for consultation. The proposals emerged in November last year and will certainly not be implemented before the end of 2003, so the period is fairly lengthy. If people, whether small retailers, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East referred, or whatever, have views or particular concerns, we would welcome their representations. We want as much information as possible to ensure that our negotiations in Europe are made from the right base. If there are further representations to be submitted, I would welcome them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the points raised by hon. Members. The debate has been interesting and provided an opportunity to consider some of the difficult balances and choices that must be made to ensure that we protect public health and maintain competitiveness and innovation. I genuinely believe that our proposals will give the traditional medicine sector the chance, at long last, to come into the main
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
stream so that the public can have confidence in it and to gain an increase in its standing in the medical field. Provided that we negotiate the directives and regulations robustly and rigorously, I genuinely believe that they will be useful in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
