	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate you, Mr. Taylor, on taking the Chair for this sitting. We look forward to your oversight of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an opportunity to debate the proposed changes to the United Kingdom pet travel scheme. The European Union proposals, which were published in September 2000 in document No. 11596/00, were modelled on the UK travel scheme, and we understand the logic of that. Little progress was made on the directive during 2000 and 2001, but Spain indicated that the proposal is one of its priorities for its presidency during the first half of 2002, and there have been several meetings to discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest text is in document No. 7947/02 dated 17 April 2002, which members of the Committee have and which we are discussing today. The Agriculture Council considered it on 22 April. The scheme is modelled on the UK scheme, so we very much agree with it, but two main differences arose in the discussions about the changes. The first is to do with blood testing—there was some debate about whether our measures are acceptable. The other difference is on the tick and tapeworm treatments that we insist on for animals coming to the UK. Several pathogens and parasites are not found in the UK, and it is important that we protect the health of animals and humans in this country. The proposal allows us to keep our tick treatment, unchanged, for five years. The treatment will be reviewed at the end of that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the EU proposals will result in little change to what we are already doing. All cats and dogs—the scheme now also applies to ferrets—coming to the UK must be identified by a microchip. The regulation temporarily allows the continued use of tattooing for those countries such as France that continue to use that system. We do not use tattooing as part of our pet travel scheme, and we do not propose to change that. In the UK, identification will continue to be based on microchips. However, French animals coming to the UK, even though they may be tattooed, also have to be identified by a microchip to meet our standards. That will continue to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animals must also be vaccinated against rabies. That, too, is a current requirement. If the animal is coming to the UK from another member state or a country listed in annexe II, part B, which is in the documents that members of the Committee have, a blood sample has to be taken and sent for analysis. If a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
satisfactory result is obtained, the animal can enter the UK six months after the blood sample is taken, not six months after the result is provided. Again, that is exactly the same as at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, under the pet travel scheme there are 51 qualifying countries, including rabies-free islands such as Australia, Cyprus and the Falklands, from which cats and dogs that meet the scheme's requirements— identification, vaccination, a blood test and a six-month wait—can enter the UK without going into quarantine. Exactly the same is true under the EU regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations lay down in article 9 the criteria that countries must meet to be considered for addition to the list. The criteria are very similar to those used in the UK, with the main difference being that the UK requires countries to have been free from indigenous rabies for the previous two years. The EU regulations do not require that because, although the EU is mostly rabies free, there are pockets of the disease, so the regulations could hardly require qualifying countries to be totally rabies free when the EU is not yet in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rabies eradication programme in mainland Europe has been successful, and rabies is now found only on the eastern edge of Europe—there is a concentration on the German-Polish border. The list of favoured countries will be decided by the European Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health—previously the Standing Veterinary Committee—and will be published in a Commission regulation before the Council regulation comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the EU has accepted that the UK, Ireland and Sweden are free from the echinococcus tapeworm, and the regulation provides for current controls to continue. That is covered in article 15 of the proposal. The UK and Ireland argued that they are also free from certain cat and dog diseases that are transmitted by ticks. We argued that article 15 should be extended to allow us to continue our requirement that dogs and cats coming to the UK should be treated against ticks. The Council agreed to that on 22 April, and we expect a suitable amendment to appear in the next version of the text. I am happy to take questions on the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the pet travel scheme has been popular and has dealt with many concerns of people who had been separated from their animals, not just about expense, but about the effect on their families and on animal welfare. We have always understood those issues. I was pleased to see in one of the Sundays that the pet travel scheme has been included in a list of great recent innovations. The scheme is developing, and it is compatible with the EU scheme, which is modelled on our experience. Debate continues over the number of countries that should be on the candidate list. That will be given careful consideration. The scheme has been successful overall, and I am pleased that an agreement with the EU has been reached that meets our requirement and which is subject to the Committee's scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time. We are likely to have ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor. Someone once said that some are born great, some acquire greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. In a small way this afternoon, I suddenly appear to be in category C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for the explanatory memorandum. I notice that the tailpiece states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lastly, there is provision for Member States to demand additional guarantees where special circumstances so require."</p></blockquote>
That wording has obviously been carefully chosen, so can the Minister elaborate on those special circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful that what I say is in line with the EU's intention, because this is an EU directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall operate within the directive's framework, but will apply exactly the same regulations as we do currently. The only change will be that, after a five-year transitional period, there will be a review of the blood testing and tick requirements. Those are special provisions that we have always had in our scheme, and we are being allowed to keep them because we believe that that is right for our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider the other candidate nations to see whether they are rabies free. We have progressively extended the number of countries on our list in the light of representations. If there are requests to extend the number further, and there have been requests to consider North America, we would commission risk assessments, as we have done, to see whether we could accede to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We occasionally receive special requests from countries about working dogs, which are also considered on their merits. We have, for example, allowed a number of United States army sniffer dogs into this country under strict criteria. Sadly, we also occasionally receive requests from terminally ill people who may not have complied with the six-months criterion, and we consider those on their merits. We have that flexibility. It will also allow countries to apply third-country rules to applicant countries, if agreed through the Commission procedure, because EU expansion is proposed and some of those countries have endemic rabies. We shall have to give careful thought to the procedure that will apply to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I offer you a warm welcome from these Benches, Mr. Taylor. It is always nice to see a new Chairman in his place. We shall try to be gentle with you this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will he be gentle with the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are old friends. At least, we used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, one important issue that the Committee must consider is the consequences of enlargement. The Minister referred to concerns about the frontier
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
between Germany and Poland. Will he outline the discussions that have taken place with potential new entrants, particularly because quite a large chunk of the Russian Federation lies between the Baltic countries and Poland, a new entrant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The applicant countries will be considered according to the rabies and the risk there at the time of accession. The regulation contains a safeguard provision, which is article 17. If the rabies situation changed in any member state, not just the accession countries, and became a cause for concern, the Commission could request that it be considered through the Committee procedure. That could result in animals from the member state having to meet the import requirements applicable to third countries. For the United Kingdom, it could mean animals going into quarantine. However, that would be a major change in countries where there might be a big upsurge in rabies, for example, so it is a theoretical risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Taylor. I know that you are a frequent visitor to North Norfolk, and I am pleased to say that there are no vaccination requirements for transporting any animals that you might have from Leicestershire to my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents say that a number of concerns arose as the proposals took shape bit by bit. The Minister explained that, at this point, the only variation from the current UK arrangements is the review in five years. Will the UK have control or a veto over the outcome of the review, or could a rule change be imposed? Will he say more about how the review will work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. We believe that we are justified in applying those measures because certain tick-borne diseases are not in the UK and because we are free of the particular tapeworm that the treatment is for. We do not want to risk changing our status on those diseases or parasites. The Commission accepts that. Other member states feel that they do not need to apply those measures. A further issue is blood testing, and there is debate over whether that has value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect those issues to be reviewed after five years, and we have no objection to that. It is only right and proper that, whatever system a country has, it reviews it after a certain period to see whether the regulations are delivering what is intended, whether there is another way to achieve that or whether the regulations are still required. Part of the review will be our own veterinary and scientific assessments, which we expect the Commission to take into account. The matter will also be put to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, previously the Standing Veterinary Committee, which consists of technical experts from all the member states, who will assess the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no problem with that, and if we felt that there was still a case for measures to protect our interests, we would argue it and expect the Commission to support us. If there were potential changes to be made, we would accept that. The Commission may, of course, make proposals for change, which would go before the full Council of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Ministers. If we were unhappy with any of them, we would have the opportunity to resist them there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read in the annexe the animal species involved in the scheme and in the UK pet travel scheme. I am 100 per cent. against live animal exports. Can we include all the animals subject to live export in the pet travel scheme? People can have pigs, or anything, as pets. On that basis, we could cut out something drastically wrong in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has an interesting idea about live exports. I understand the serious point that he makes about the live export of animals, particularly for slaughter. We take such issues seriously and we are addressing them, in terms of talks with our industry and the proposals currently before the Commission on long-distance movements regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that discussions are still ongoing with countries on the eastern edge, as I think he put it, of the EU. It is a known fact that many people who try to get through the channel tunnel and subsequently seek political asylum come from that part of Europe. I do not want to get into the debate about the wider asylum issue, which is not what we are here for, but I have a specific question. What would be the procedure if someone caught trying to come through the tunnel were found with a pet in their possession? How would the Government react to that eventuality, and does the regulation affect it in any way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the regulation does not change that. If anyone comes through the tunnel with a pet in their possession that has not met the standards laid down in the pet travel scheme, the animal will be put in quarantine and might have to stay there for the full six-month quarantine period. There are procedures in place in the channel tunnel to detect any animal that might seek to come through. In the whole of its existence, there has never been evidence of any animal getting through, unlike people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend inform us whether there has been any breach of the UK regulations, any prosecution or any failure by pet owners to comply with regulations resulting in legal action being taken against them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any legal action being taken against pet owners who have tried to enter the UK in breach of the pet travel scheme. In our experience, the vast majority of people appreciate the facility that has been put in place and make every effort to comply with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of cases, although I am glad to say that the number is reducing, of people failing to comply with the criteria—not deliberately, but because the paperwork from the vet in the country from which they have come was not in order or because the microchip was not detectable. In one, the people involved paid for a microchip to be inserted, but that clearly did not happen. That is between them and the vet whom they paid to do it, but it caused difficulties when they arrived at a point of entry. Some
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
90 per cent. of failures are rectified within 24 hours. Only a small number of people with pets have been unable to meet the criteria, and their failure has not been deliberate, but the result of a failure of procedures in the countries from which they have come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that at an earlier stage in the development of the proposals, the advisory group on quarantine expressed its particular concerns about the effectiveness of tattoos, which can be tampered with, as opposed to electronic methods. Will the Minister confirm how many countries use tattoos and how much effort was made to rule them out as a means of identification? Tattoos seem to be a wholly flawed method while the microchip is a recognisable alternative that is already used in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Offhand, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a full list of those countries that use tattoos as a method of identification, but I certainly know that France does. The Standing Veterinary Committee and the Council took the view that those countries with an existing identification system should retain it throughout the eight-year interim period. Although such countries may retain tattooing, they can still use microchipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that the EU is moving to a standard on microchipping, which is the preferable method of identification because, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) rightly says, unlike tattoos it cannot be interfered with. Sometimes tattoos are hard to read, and sometimes they are hard to find because in some countries animals are tattooed on the back of their neck, which means that one has to part the fur and start looking around. That is not always a good idea with very large dogs. Overall, the microchip is a more convenient way for people to achieve identification, and that is the standard that we apply in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Taylor, you may remember an important historic breach when an animal, the famous monkey, came to this country during the Napoleonic wars through a port just up from Whitby, namely Hartlepool. My serious point is that in coastal areas such as my constituency, a lot of east European vessels, which occasionally carry pet animals, pop in and out of port. Will the Minister inform the Committee of the safeguards and measures that can be taken by port authorities to ensure that our regulations and those of the EU cannot be breached? Indeed, members of the Committee have alluded to those animals perhaps becoming civic dignitaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot do much about animals becoming civic dignitaries, which is a matter for the electorate. Exactly the same procedures apply to all points of entry, including ports. Of course, animals that come in under the pet scheme have to do so through designated points of entry. Any animal covered by the regulations and found in a port that is not designated is, of course, subject to quarantine regulations until the matter is resolved. That also applies to animals that do not meet the standards and have strayed off ships. Everyone coming to UK ports is well aware of the regulations and generally complies with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Documents Nos. 11596/00 and 12488/01, draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal-health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals; and congratulates the Government on securing for the United Kingdom, during the subsequent negotiations, the continuation, for at least five years, of arrangements similar to those contained in the successful United Kingdom Pet Travel Scheme.—[	<i>Mr. Morley.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, but I want to make a few brief points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I thank the Minister for his reassurance on the channel tunnel. We do not want to discuss the wider matter of asylum this afternoon, but it is reassuring to know that procedures remain in place to prevent any unauthorised animal from entering the United Kingdom through the channel tunnel under its own power or assisted by someone attempting to come through the tunnel. I reiterate our thanks for that reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to make a point about the five-year review period. I suspect that our discussion is not controversial because we have the prospect of quinquennial review, so we shall be able to return to the matter in 2007, but I put down a small marker. As with all matters relating to the EU, we in the United Kingdom sometimes believe that we have done well to achieve a period of grace. We must return to the matter, however, so we cannot kid ourselves that it is parked indefinitely. The Government have bought time for five years and the issue is not settled for all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, and before you rule me out of order, Mr. Taylor, as I have not detained the Minister inordinately this afternoon, I hope that he will allow me to meet him in the near future to discuss an unrelated constituency matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be equally brief. It is important to say that we support the proposals, and it is good news that the whole of Europe is adopting the scheme introduced in this country. That must be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked about the five-year review and I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister. He said that any change would be considered by the Council of Ministers, where we would have an opportunity to make representations. I presume that the matter would be subject to qualified majority voting. Will he confirm that? The Conservative spokesman managed to introduce asylum seekers to a debate on pets, and I thought that he might suggest that dogs would have to apply for asylum. I shall not comment further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the Committee process. I am pleased that we have a bound volume of papers. As a new Member, I have been frustrated by the awful mix of documents that we must consider with no pagination or clarity in their labelling. This is an advance, but there is still no pagination and I have written to the Clerk on the matter. It would be helpful if the complete set of documents were properly
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
paginated. The explanatory memorandum at the front is dated 17 October 2000 and a search must be made deep into the bundle for a later explanatory memorandum. It would be helpful to have a document at the front to guide Members through the papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's points have been noted and I shall ask the Clerk to write to the Clerk of Standing Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the comments of the hon. Member for North Norfolk on the documentation. The Department tries to get documents to the Committee as quickly as it can, although we are obviously sometimes in the hands of the European Union in relation to that. I understand that the binding is a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs innovation, so I am pleased to hear his comments on that. I certainly appreciate the points made by the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois). He is representing his party. I do not know whether he knew that when he came to the sitting, but he certainly does now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Francois</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was well aware that I would be representing my party, but I did not understand at what level I would be representing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley: </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He made some fair points, and I hope that I have reassured him and other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Norfolk made a point about change. I can confirm that, if there were disagreement after four years, it would be a matter of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers. Other member states tend to be pretty reasonable on such issues. They recognised that the UK, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland operated an established system that suited their national interests and worked. Although one or two member states queried issues such as the need for blood testing and the six-month wait, they were happy to allow us to continue with the scheme that we established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear to the Committee that DEFRA has no objection to a review after five years. We would expect to review any of our procedures at regular intervals—five years is about the upper limit—to see whether they stand up to examination. If it is felt after five years that there is no need for blood testing, we shall be happy to accept that. At present, however, we think that the tick and tapeworm treatments are important for our country. The scheme has been accepted, and has been successful: to date, 45,000 cats and dogs have entered this country under the pet travel scheme. We implemented the scheme based on the scientific advice that we had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we recognised that we would have to argue for the changes in the Council of Ministers. Generally, people give us a sympathetic hearing when we have a good case. We are not isolated in Europe; we have friends and allies. People tend to accept that we do not ask for things unless there is a case for them, which counts in relation to how our requests are dealt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
with by our European partners. I feel quite confident about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the discussions on the EU directive have progressed faster than we expected. We expect agreement in the Council in June. We have achieved the objectives that we set ourselves, which we believe strike a balance between protecting the health status of our country, and trying to minimise undue burdens and costs for those people who understandably want to move their animals in and out of the country for a variety of reasons. We think that it is a good outcome for us. We shall continue to monitor the situation, and continue to make public on our website the various studies and risk assessments that we have, when they are available to be publicised, so that people can see the work that we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the scheme has been successful. I give credit to organisations such as the Passports for Pets campaign, which campaigned strongly. As far as I am aware, everyone who has participated in the scheme
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
has done so responsibly and reliably, which shows that people respect it and do not abuse the procedures. I am glad that the EU has recognised our requirements and given us the right to carry on with the scheme virtually unchanged for five years. We can apply it within EU rules as we see appropriate, according to the criteria that we assess and bearing it in mind that we do not want to jeopardise our rabies-free status or the health status of our country. I do not believe that the scheme does so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
