<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall debate several reports on European Union fraud and financial management. They cover important work, and I am pleased that the Committee has shown the priority that it attaches to the fight against fraud by holding such a debate. Before I answer questions, I wish to make a few introductory comments. When discussing the documents, we shall need to remember that the process of tackling fraud and reforming the financial management of European Union institutions is ongoing. We have already made good progress. Many problems have been identified, a reform process has been initiated, new bodies have been established, old structures have been abolished, and a new financial framework will soon be in place. The pace of change is sometimes depressingly slow, but effective change in the European Union context can happen only if we work with others, persuade them of the virtues of reform and keep pressing for results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first document, the annual report of the European Court of Auditors, plays a useful part in keeping up the pressure for reform. It is of concern that, for 2000 as for 1999 and for each year since 1994, the ECA was unable to give a positive statement of assurance, but the fact that it continues to seek out irregularities and to point to inadequacies in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
financial management of EU funds gives us confidence that close scrutiny is taking place and that the Commission's attention will remain focused on the need for reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the level of detected irregularities is the reason why the ECA has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance. However, I remind the Committee that we cannot equate error and irregularity with fraud and waste. Indeed, in the majority of cases, discrepancies are not frauds but administrative errors, such as use of the wrong exchange rate, small overpayments to farmers or not complying fully with complex Community regulations—the sort of errors that are easily, swiftly and regularly corrected. It is easy for the press to write headlines such as "£3 billion fraud in EC budget", but that misrepresents what is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point to remember is that ECA reports help to deliver improvements. For example, an ECA report recommended that the anti-fraud office—OLAF—be set up. Many of the recommendations in its 1999 report regarding the recasting of the financial regulations have been adopted in the latest draft proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report does not only criticise, but highlights improvements. In its report on 2000, the ECA acknowledged several areas in which improvements have been made. On agricultural expenditure, the report commended the reformed clearance of the accounts system and referred to one of its special reports, which concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission's strategy for dealing with BSE is basically sound".</p></blockquote>
On structural funds, the report notes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the URBAN community initiative has helped the implementation of many urban development projects and has enabled local authorities to access EU funds".</p></blockquote>
On external aid, it stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo was both efficient and economical".</p></blockquote>
Those positive comments show that improvements can be and have been made, but we all recognise that more is needed before we can expect a positive statement of assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned, Commission reforms represent work in progress. The reform agenda has three key objectives: the introduction of a better system of assessing priorities; an overhaul of financial management in the Commission; and the modernisation of personnel policy. Fundamental reform takes time to implement because the culture in an organisation must be changed. However, progress has been made on all three objectives. In particular, I shall inform the Committee of the most recent progress on financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strengthening of the financial regulation—the Commission's budgetary rule book—has long been seen as a crucial part of the reform package. The regulation was introduced in 1977 and has been amended several times, all of which tended to make the system more complex. The task for reformers was to produce a coherent revision that enshrined clear and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
strong principles of budgetary control, but avoided minute details that led only to confusion and unintentional non-compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to report that the Council's work on the Commission's proposals is at an advanced stage, thanks to the recent priority that the Spanish presidency gave to the regulation. Work is on track for a new regulation to come into force next year. The new financial regulation should help to reduce complexities, introduce a truly independent internal audit, increase the accountability of front-line officials and bring both objective setting and evaluation to the forefront of budget setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, such changes to the financial management rule book will be insufficient to stop the small minority who deliberately try to defraud the European Commission's budget. The Government believe that any deliberate attempt to defraud the budget is grave. There must be zero tolerance of fraud and fraudsters, and necessary resources must be found for detection and prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the ECA's criticisms for financial year 2000 was that progress has been slow in the reorganisation of the European Union's anti-fraud work, and, especially, that staffing increased more slowly than was foreseen. Given the important role that OLAF must play, that is a worry. Although the position has improved since 2000, it is not fully resolved, and, even now, staff levels are only around 80 per cent. of the authorised complement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, OLAF has made progress, and it has tightened up the legal framework. In 2000, that included tightening up the penal-judicial dimension. It has worked with the Council to improve links between relevant authorities in member states, and Eurojust, an EU judicial co-operation unit, has been established to work alongside OLAF. OLAF has conducted many investigations across a range of European Union activities, such as illegal trafficking of agricultural products, fraudulent claims for European regional development fund and European social fund moneys, and a wide-ranging investigation into cigarette smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of cigarette smuggling is not unique to the United Kingdom: it affects almost all EU member states. Among the documents tagged to today's debate is a report from the Commission on the rate of excise duty applied on cigarettes. The Government do not believe that reducing UK duty rates to those of Italy or Spain, for example, would have a significant impact on our major cigarette smuggling problem. Those countries have low tobacco tax but still suffer widespread cigarette smuggling. International organised crime syndicates are responsible for the great bulk of cigarette smuggling. Their operations occur on a large scale, and most of the cigarettes originate from outside the EU. The solution is to crack down on smugglers, which is being done in the UK with increasing success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We are debating important documents that highlight many problems that must be tackled. However, there are many positive developments. Several Commission and Council initiatives have taken effect, although others will take longer. I assure the Committee that the Government will continue to play an active role in keeping the fight against fraud and waste high on the European agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 5.30 pm, at the latest, for questions to the Minister. Questions should be brief and asked one at a time. Hon. Members are likely to have ample opportunity to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bercow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a junior shadow Home Office spokesman for 13 months, Miss Widdecombe, I greatly enjoyed being subject to your ministrations. I hope that I will similarly enjoy your firm and fair authority this afternoon, and I welcome you to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for her opening statement. What is the current status of the review of internal control systems in each directorate-general and of the creation of an audit capability in each directorate to provide advice and assurance about the system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is aware, internal control systems are an important part of the new approach to combating irregularities and fraud in the EU. That process has been initiated, but it is still developing because it is part of a wider agenda to change the entire culture of the institutions. That must be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it been possible to build on the measures outlined in the document to take account of the events of 11 September and the subsequent crackdown on money laundering, or are we still relying on what was foreseen in 1999–2000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some respects, we are still at an early stage of the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September. Their implications have not yet been fully analysed and thought through in most member states. The documents were produced before 11 September; most of the work was conducted in 2000. The events of 11 September will create significant repercussions in the debate about international co-operation against crime, for example. However, we are still at an early stage of the process of understanding their implications, and they have not been taken into account in these documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What reasons has the Minister adduced for the alarming size of traditional own resources fraud, and in the light of that, does she think that there is an urgent need for a civil penalty regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Own resources have traditionally been more subject to fraud than other resource areas, and we will continue to examine that. I had the pleasure of debating the introduction of own resources measures in the House with the hon. Gentleman, and the legislation that we passed will move us away from traditional own resources measures, towards a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
measure based more on gross national product. One beneficial impact will be a reduction in the possibility of fraud in such areas. We must crack down on existing fraud, and I understand that a civil penalties regime will be introduced this year, which I welcome as a significant contribution to the general battle against fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 21 of the European Scrutiny Committee's report on the documents, tables list the number of cases of fraud, changes in the number of cases, and changes in the sums affected by those cases. Some of the figures are astonishing; there are changes, year on year, of 239 per cent., 101 per cent., and one, in terms of millions of euros, of 758 per cent. I want the Minister to shed some light on those astonishing figures, and to reassure me that they are not as alarming as they appear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been involved in many debates such as this, and I am sure that he knows that figures that are produced from year to year are notoriously volatile. They can fluctuate for a variety of reasons—a scheme, for example, may come to fruition in a particular year. For that reason, I advise him not to read too much into the figures. We should consider the overall trend. Many of the measures introduced to overcome particular issues with regard to fraud and irregularities have yet to bear fruit and are gradually coming on stream. I urge him not to read too much into yearly figures because they are naturally volatile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Barrett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the distinction between error and fraud that she mentioned in her opening statement? Member states have intimated that the number of cases is 6,587. How many are fraud, and how many errors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ECA report considers irregularities rather than fraud, and it is difficult to draw a distinction between the two. Irregularities is a broad term that covers, for instance, forms that may be slightly incorrectly filled in, or a misinterpretation of a tightly drawn community rule, or the misapplication of an exchange rate on the day on which the form was filled in, and so forth. Many irregularities can be swiftly and easily reversed once identified. Many sums are subsequently recovered, with no loss to community funds. The ECA report does not try to estimate the precise level of fraud. It is important to maintain the distinction between fraud and irregularities. In no sense do the broad figures reported on the number of irregularities reflect deliberate fraud against EU institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), will the Minister confirm that the reason for the 758 per cent. growth in traditional own resources cases identified by OLAF was probably partly that OLAF is a new body? I sat on the Committee that debated its establishment, and the 1999 figures are drawn from a year in which it was not yet fully in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. OLAF is a new institution that is just getting its teeth into the work. However, variation between years probably relates more to when fraud is identified than to fraud, or irregularity, in any particular year. Such cases are often the result of many years of investigation, sometimes involving significant sums. Such discrepancies can lead to sharp changes between years in the number of cases uncovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the four objectives of the action plan and the development of an anti-fraud approach based on article 280, what are the nature and cost of and intended time scale for the roll-out of the training and assistance programme to protect the euro from counterfeiting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the euro has been protected in an unprecedented way against the possibility of fraud and counterfeiting. It is perhaps one of the most difficult currencies to counterfeit among those currently in circulation in member states. As part of its introduction, cash management and training was undertaken in all member states to enable people to deal with its development. Continuing the fight against counterfeiting and money laundering, and dealing with other issues associated with the introduction of the euro, will continue to be a major goal in the action plan, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says. In the United Kingdom, our efforts are concentrated in the National Criminal Intelligence Service and on co-ordinating its activities with other bodies throughout Europe. Strategies will be developed over many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether we take up the Minister's suggestion that the year-to-year figures are volatile or the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) that OLAF is only just getting into gear, the figures suggest that there has been a substantial fraud in the past. The European Union has operated for a long time. Will there be any attempt to identify substantial fraud that has been overlooked and to do something about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of setting up OLAF was to identify fraud, wherever it is to be found, and to root it out. The streamlining of the Commission's procurement and personnel processes will make that easier. OLAF has already undertaken several investigations, some of which have gone on for a considerable time. With its new independent powers and authority, it will find it easier to conclude those investigations and to require action when evidence of malpractice is found. The figures are taken seriously and are proof, in some respects, of the seriousness with which the Commission is taking fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As happens so often, the hon. Member for Luton, North and I are thinking along similar lines, although I do not mean to damn him by that observation. On page 59 of the Commission report, it is stated that in 2000 the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
	<br><blockquote><p>"reviewed all debts … outstanding for more than two years."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Will the Minister put me out of my misery and tell me the outcome of that review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: MAFF, now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has rigorous controls in place to ensure that money is not misappropriated, and that money received from the EU, in particular, is used in a cost-effective way in compliance with regulations. Departments will regularly want to review long-standing issues and decide whether to take action. If the hon. Gentleman is referring to a specific issue, perhaps I could take up that matter and write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions—I shall ask them one at a time, as you requested, Miss Widdecombe—on the report on cigarettes. I declare a constituency interest; some of my constituents work in the industry, although others are militantly opposed to it. The EU proposes rather low minimum excise rates, which, as paragraph 2.15 of the report states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"means only a few Member States have to increase their excise duties."</p></blockquote>
The report notes that excise rates are lower still for applicant states, which would probably need a lengthy transition period to adjust to even those low minimum rates. Does not the Minister think, despite her comments, that that will increase the incentive to smuggle rather than provide a degree of harmonisation in the community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree because I do not believe that the overriding incentive for tobacco smuggling is the difference in excise duty rates between member states. In fact, a lot of evidence suggests that cigarettes smuggled into the UK come not from other EU countries, but may be manufactured in the UK, exported and reintroduced into the country. That sort of analysis has led the Government to introduce our anti-smuggling initiative on smoking, which was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the pre-Budget report. The Government are funding a £209 million programme to reduce tobacco smuggling within three years. Analysis suggests that measures such as introducing almost 1,000 more front-line staff to investigate tobacco smuggling, setting up a national network of X-ray scanners to detect large volumes of smuggled goods contained in freight containers and introducing a UK duty-paid stamp on cigarette packets are more appropriate than an artificial harmonisation of duty paid across the EU. If my hon. Friend reads the analysis produced at the time of the PBR, he may find that those measures will achieve the proposed aim of reducing tobacco smuggling within three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Farrelly 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister made an interesting observation about tobacco smuggling when she said that the tobacco may be exported from this country and then imported back again. I believe that the only major British manufacturer that does not predominantly sell in this country is British American Tobacco, which, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Minister will recognise from her previous employment at 	<i>The Guardian,</i> has been at the centre of major smuggling controversies. Is she pointing the finger at BAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not naming any individual tobacco companies. I am stating the principle that the way to combat tobacco smuggling is to take action. For instance, the introduction of the UK duty-paid frank on cigarette packs will lead to clear identification of products on which duty has been paid in advance so that if cigarettes are exported, they cannot be imported back again and avoid that duty. Any cigarette packets that are discovered without that mark on them could be automatically confiscated. A huge incentive in favour of smuggling has therefore been reduced at a stroke.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took great pleasure in the Minister's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe. I agree entirely with the Government's view that we should not harmonise duties, but should instead deal with smuggling. That is absolutely right given the dreadful damage that cigarettes do to people's lives. If harmonising is to be done, other EU countries should raise their duties and taxes to our level rather than the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 4.8 on page 30 of the reference document, which lists the weaknesses identified by Court of Auditors. It refers to an underspend of 11.6 billion euros, mostly on structural measures. As the UK is a net contributor to the European budget—where we gain receipts, they tend to be structural—is not that of particular concern to the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister, I ask her, although I appreciate the difficulties of speaking from the Front Bench, to face the Chair when replying, for the sake of the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Miss Widdecombe, and shall address my remarks to the Chair in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The surplus of 11 billion euros is perhaps an advantage to the UK as a net contributor because we are likely to receive a refund in the following year on some of the money that we have contributed through our own resources. However, it is clearly significant that there should be such a surplus at the end of the year. It suggests partly that the Commission has not acted to reduce the surplus and that it needs to do so, and partly that its own forecasting processes are not particularly accurate and could be significantly improved. If I may defend the Court of Auditors, its forecasts depend largely on figures produced by individual member states, and it would help if the Commission were in more regular touch with member states to assess the reliability of data. If such a surplus is envisaged, some of it should be refunded within the relevant year, rather than at the end of it. I agree with the Court of Auditors that the Commission should use its powers to return money if a similar position arises in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me complete my questions on cigarettes. The Select Committee on the Treasury received evidence showing the dramatic impact of anti-smuggling measures on the volume of cigarettes smuggled into this country, which is good news. Am I right that Britain would not favour an increase in excise duty on cigarettes—if only for health reasons—on African and other countries with low rates? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North that that would be the way forward, and does the Minister agree that it would not hinder the anti-smuggling effort?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are good health reasons why the UK has chosen its current rate of duty on cigarettes. Smoking kills 120,000 people a year. Clearly tax on cigarettes is a major factor inhibiting the growth of smoking. Other member states may consider the evidence and, in the light of their own democratic consultation, decide to follow our example. I would, however, hesitate to impose our approach—taken on health grounds—on other countries that might find it difficult to adjust to the regime or that might decide not to follow that route for historical or democratic reasons. I emphasise that the differential in duty rates is not the primary cause of our difficulties with cigarette smuggling. Italy and Spain place low duty on cigarettes, but also face problems with smuggling. No close correlation exists between the level of duty in a country and the ability and willingness of people to smuggle cigarettes into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to page 32 of the Court of Auditors report, which sets out conclusions? Paragraph 4.11 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court is still unable to compare Member States' ability and efficiency in detecting fraud and other irregularities and recovering any sums involved."</p></blockquote>
It seems unable—or perhaps unwilling—to decide in which country fraud occurs. Will the Minister comment? It may be significant to discover which countries are more fraudulent than others. I hope that the UK would be found less fraudulent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. Perhaps we should be less concerned about the differences between member states than the differences between sectors in the Community budget.

For the first time, the Court of Auditors will be able consider specific sectors and specific areas of high risk, not just the global picture, of the EU budget. That important development will assist the combating of fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there are no more questions, I will ask the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the European Union Documents Nos. 9208/01, Protecting the Communities' Financial Interests—the fight against fraud: Commission's Twelfth Annual Report 2000, 92707/01, Protecting the Communities' Financial Interests—Fight Against Fraud: Action Plan for 2001–2003, and the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2000; and encourages the Government's continuing efforts to promote and support measures to improve financial management and reduce the opportunities for fraud against the EC financial interest.—	<i>[Ruth Kelly.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>5.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to get to the nitty gritty. I, on the packed Opposition Benches, do not intend to oppose the Government's motion. There is much good sense in it. There is also much about the Minister's approach that commends itself to my party and, I suspect, to many others. However, there is a serious and, some would say, growing problem of fraud in EU institutions and in member states in their dealings with EU programmes. As the European Scrutiny Committee noted, it is undoubtedly a matter of concern that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court's audit work on operational expenditure revealed once again an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amounts of the payments".</p></blockquote>
The Minister was, however, right to distinguish between error and fraud. Similarly, the eligibility of the underlying transactions has frequently been called into question. There are also
	<br><blockquote><p>"weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures in the principal systems covering Agricultural Guarantee and Structural Measures expenditure."</p></blockquote>
The growth of traditional own resources fraud is also allied to the phenomenon of the abuse of agricultural and structural funds expenditure. Together, they constitute a smash and grab raid on the funds paid by hard-working taxpayers throughout the European Union. The Court states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in general, the Commission needs to improve the definition of the objectives of Community programmes and then undertake effective evaluation of their achievement, in order to ensure sound and efficient use of the European Union's resources."</p></blockquote>
As of 12 February 2002, no one could say that we always get the best value for every pound that is spent or, dare I say it, every euro. That is manifestly not the case. It ought to be the case in the future. After all, the current budget is 94.5 billion euros, or £58 billion. That is an enormous sum of money, substantially greater than that spent by most major Departments, including, if my memory serves me correctly, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Court of Auditors tells us that approximately 5 per cent. of the EU budget was unaccounted for in 2000, which we can also glean from other documents. I suspect that it was merely a mild lapse and an uncharacteristic and infelicitous use of words, but I was a little perturbed when the Minister said that to talk in headline or tabloid terms about £3 billion of public money being wasted was to get the matter grossly out of proportion and to misrepresent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the position. Explaining fraud, misappropriation or waste is one thing, but excusing it or seeking to downplay its significance is another. The Minister jealously guards her reputation as a frugal steward of the public purse, and I hope that she will agree that to waste up to, or more than, £2.5 billion of public money, or £15 per EU family, remains a significant problem that needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point in a non-partisan way. I do not dispute that the problems arose in previous years. They are evils that have bedevilled successive Governments. We must consider whether the situation is getting worse and whether the systems in the European Union are conducive to either the counteraction or, arguably, the proliferation of fraud. If it is the latter and the systems are so complex that they lead to waste and misappropriation, something should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors said that the European Union Executive still lacked an effective modern accounting system and that it had failed to bolster our good friend OLAF, the new European anti-fraud office. John Wiggins, a British member of the court, recently said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission still doesn't take seriously enough the need to improve its accounts and accounting mechanisms…It has tried to tighten up the regulations, but loopholes remain."</p></blockquote>
Most of the money is lost from the agriculture and regional aid budgets that make up around 85 per cent. of the European Union budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have the damning verdict, which was revealed by the Minister but not dwelled on for long, of the President of the Court of Auditors, Jan Karlsson. Presenting the court's annual report to the European Parliament last November, he confirmed that once again something of a pattern has emerged and that the court had chosen not to give the Commission a positive statement of assurance on its execution of the EU budget. To explain a decision that he must have regretted having to make, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although there are now a number of hopeful signs we cannot give a positive discharge because they cannot be registered in audits yet."</p></blockquote>
Ultimately, it is to that that we must come in this debate. We should ask not who has a good idea, or whether there is a report or a debate, but at what point good intention translates into effective action in a way that will save money and make people's lives better. After all, that is the purpose for which we are all here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Karlsson went on to say that one of the main problem areas for misspending was what he described—and I animadvert on the point to which I alluded a moment ago—as the "enormous complexity" of the EU's regional funding programmes. On 13 November 2001, he said that the "system of structural funds" was so complicated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it was almost impossible to execute".</p></blockquote>
Yet the Court of Auditors has reported that the operation of the new European anti-fraud office has been hampered by constraints of staff recruitment and management, together with the problem of inadequate databases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I share the desire expressed by the Minister to see a functioning, robust and effective OLAF. However, I hope that she will not in any way relax her guard. The fact that the organisation has been established is only a modest comfort. We must be clear that it has both the resources and authority—a point to which I will return—to make effective investigations and progress in counteracting fraud. The court goes on to complain that the Commission has not introduced adequate control procedures to ensure value for money and sound management of its contribution, particularly to cover the risks highlighted by previous allegations of irregularities and evidence of mismanagement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recent work by the French court of accounts makes shocking reading for all Committee members. An official French audit of the common agricultural policy—I am not too sure of the difference between an official French audit and an unofficial one, although I am sure that you will be, Miss Widdecombe— suggested that the documentation on the 9 billion euros, which is £5.47 billion, received each year by French farmers is riddled with accounting errors. The court spent a year trying to understand a policy that eats up approximately half of the European Union's total budget, which is a damning indictment of the folly and inadequacy of the existing system. Eventually it gave up the unequal struggle, and even the high brows on it had to admit in February 2001 that they had failed to come to terms with the content of the policy. I refer those Members who are not immediately familiar with the background not only to the copious documents that we have had to study for today's debate, but to an excellent report on 1 February 2001 in 	<i>The Times,</i> under the accurate headline, "Auditors condemn £5 billion tangle of secret farming subsidies".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common agricultural policy, which concerns many Members in our constituencies and all Members because of its implications for the public purse, will cost 45 billion euros out of a total EU budget of 98 billion euros. The court repeatedly asked Brussels how many French farmers were receiving subsidies, how much those subsidies were and on what the farmers were spending the money. It never received an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report offers a savage commentary on the existing system and the inability even of those charged with its administration to understand it properly in stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the figures were neither available in their totality nor often compiled at all".</p></blockquote>
The court sought to calculate the sums itself and concluded that, in addition to the 7.71 billion euros handed out by the European Union, French farmers received about 1 billion euros from their own Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is significant and the Minister will be hanging on it. The court said that there were 1 million recipients in France of agricultural subsidies handed out by Paris or Brussels, yet the country officially has only 663,000 farms. That mismatch does not require further elaboration by me, but it would be helpful to receive an answer or at least an expression of concern from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The court said that the complexity of the system made detailed scrutiny impossible. It went on to say that French agriculture received 300 separate types of subsidy from Brussels, 140 types from Paris and 38 types financed jointly by Brussels and Paris. There are too many schemes, too much complexity, too many hurdles to negotiate and a system that, in the end, is impossible for either the layman or those who operate it to understand. Is not that the root of our problems? I am focusing only on one issue; I could focus on more in detail, but I am conscious that members of the Committee will want to favour us with detailed contributions of their own and it is important that there should be adequate time for that important democratic exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend instead therefore to focus my remarks on a series of questions to the Minister. I am inclined to ask questions because that is an important part of the democratic entitlement and responsibility of all hon. Members, so I shall crack on. The hon. Lady will be relieved to know that I asked some questions earlier, so four or five fewer are on my list. Nevertheless, there still many that I should like to ask and I should be grateful for any answers that she can give me now. When she does not have an immediate power of recall, which will be extremely rare in her case, she may be able to provide further and better particulars to me in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is about to ask questions, but can we first establish that the system that we are discussing was in a sense the system under his own party? Does his party not have blood on its hands? The common agricultural policy, to which reforms have been needed for some time, is much the same as it was when his party was in power. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee and we have said that reform of the common agricultural policy would eradicate several opportunities for fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that I was grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but I am not sure that I am. I have a great liking and a healthy respect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please face the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Miss Widdecombe. That was a discourtesy, which I dare not repeat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had started to say that I have both a great liking and a healthy respect for the hon. Gentleman, but he is being uncharacteristically and precipitately partisan. I thought that I had so far been the model of emollience. I accept that such a process has happened under Governments of both colours and what he said about the origins of the common agricultural policy contains a good deal of sense. If the hon. Gentleman challenges me to defend all past decisions of previous Conservative Ministers on the matter, and notably the decisions of those who served at the head of the Heath Government of 1970 to 1974, he will not find me a willing taker. It is important to put that on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Let me not be distracted a moment longer from the questions on which I wish to focus. What are the Government doing to put pressure on the Commission to implement reform rather than talk about it? That is a crucial distinction. Recommendations have been made in many spheres, and the Minister slipped into referring to a draft proposal that had been amended, revised and—her demeanour suggested—improved during discussions. However, she seemed dewy-eyed about the fact that an amended and improved draft proposal is in the offing. The Minister will not hold it against me if I tell her that the important point is to have a good proposal that is implemented as quickly as possible. It would be useful to know the steps that the Government are taking to pressure the Commission into speedy reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government doing to simplify the complex eligibility rules and to minimise the number and cost of errors made at home? When will the European Union reform the incestuous and potentially fraudulent system of A30 earmarked grants? Many commentators believe that we need an above-board process of open and competitive bids. Currently, the grants allow for expenditure on party political funding and pro-integration propaganda— even if that is not the intention. That is wholly unacceptable, and I am sure that the Minister will want to deprecate it. I look forward to hearing the Government's plans for fundamental changes to the existing, flawed system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assessment has the Minister made of the instrument for structural policies for pre-accession programme and the SAPARD programme, which is the special accession programme for agricultural and rural development? These matters are dealt with on pages 283 to 305 of the report. The budget for 2000 to 2006 is no less than 11 billion euros, which is a very large sum. At this relatively early stage in the allocation of funds, I am keen to establish the Government's view of the likely efficacy and fraud-minimisation potential of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister make of the verdict of the president of the European Court of Auditors who declared that the implementation of the 2000 budget was characterised by
	<br><blockquote><p>"the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure, amounting to over 11.6 billion euros"?</p></blockquote>
That point was touched on earlier, and we enjoyed the Minister's initial thoughts. Will she focus on that subject a little more? We are discussing a sum that is equivalent to more than 14 per cent. of the final payment expenditure. If we are discussing one seventh of total funds to be allocated, we must know why we got into that mess, and what financial mechanisms are in place, or will be in place shortly, to avoid any repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the court's recommendation that the Commission should examine how it may better use the supplementary and amending budget procedure to avoid excessive budget surpluses. Are the Government sympathetic to that proposal? If so, when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
will it take effect? Does the Minister have a ballpark estimate of the speed and likelihood of avoiding the surpluses or, at any rate, greatly reducing them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My seventh inquiry—my list is very modest—relates to the discovery by the court of "persistent weaknesses", to use its words, in member states' checking of community operations concerning programmes in which management is shared between the Commission and the member states. That was the case for the integrated administrative and control system payments, which is the so-called IACS, the export refunds and the control regulation for structural measures. On collaboration between European and national supreme audit institutions, the president concludes that progress requires collaboration between national Parliaments and the European Parliament. My perusal of the documents has left me unclear about what is happening on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several inquiries flow from the Treasury's July 2001 document, which is entitled "Statement on the 2001 EC Budget and Measures to Counter Fraud and Financial Mismanagement". I applaud the document, and I tell the Minister that it is has not only been helpful on the learning curve, but it has spawned several inquiries in my mind that would probably not otherwise have occurred to me. She will agree that it is a valuable document in that respect, if no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 43, on page 10, refers to several shortcomings—I am taking a specific example, because we are concerned with specifics rather than the holistic overview—in the monitoring of wine production. Has there been a discernable improvement on that? There is talk of a problem with the number of vineyard registers; it is implied that there are too few rather than too many. Has the problem of understaffing at the inspection body been addressed? That was alluded to with angst and disapproval in the Treasury document, and it would be useful to have an update on the position seven months later. Can the Minister offer us hope that the situation is materially better than it was when the Treasury published its report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point relates to internal policies, to which there is a helpful reference on page 11 of the Treasury document. Of course, the court has found significant overcharging in that sector on the execution of internal policies managed by the Commission. Substantive errors stemmed from ineligible expenditure, and formal errors were attributable to failures by final beneficiaries to observe the terms of contracts. Will the Minister update us on that unsatisfactory position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several questions occurred to me when I read page 15 of the Treasury document, which focuses on the programme for Commission administrative reform. The Minister will know that a central financial service was set up in May 2000 to introduce common standards of control throughout the Commission directorates-general and to provide advice on sound
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
financial management. What assessment has been made of the efficacy of that service, which is not far short of being two years old?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An internal audit service has been operational since June 2000, and the head of the service was appointed in December 2000. Last July, the Treasury told us—using the present tense—that other staff were being recruited. How many are now in post, and what progress can the Minister report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important part of the Minister's opening remarks related to the recast financial regulation. I have a feeling that the word "recast" will feature prominently in our debate, or during subsequent consideration of these matters. It seems to be the vogue term for the proposed change to the financial regulation that is applicable to the general budget of the European Union. The proposal is aimed at modernising financial management procedures. In fairness, the proposal was brought forward in October 2000, and it is legitimate to say that fraud occurs during each year, that it gets worse in some cases and there is a large job to be done. Therefore, when will the regulation be ratified and implemented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further parts of the Treasury document focus on countering fraud against the EU budget. OLAF has revealed the smuggling of vast quantities of bananas from Equador via the Italian port of Catania. As I am sure the Minister will be aware, a joint operation in June 1999 by OLAF and the Italian Guarda di Finanza brought about an arrest of the importer allegedly responsible and a customs agent, and for that we pay tribute to them. Has there since been a reduction in banana fraud? What are the dimensions of the problem? How much does it cost public funds throughout the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Miss Widdecombe. I was being my usual courteous self to the hon. Gentleman, whose maiden speech it was my privilege to compliment some months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to an issue that will, I suspect, be of great interest to the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members—adulterated butter. The hon. Gentleman might believe that that is a subject of levity. I hope that he does not, because it is a matter of the greatest seriousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a self-effacing and modest soul, and I admit that until I studied the papers I did not know what adulterated butter was. It did not sound appetising, but I looked into it, and found, significantly, that between 1997 and 1999 several Italian-based companies manufactured industrial butter from animal fat and synthetic products—the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) looks as though his appetite is rapidly diminishing—which they sold on as butter to clients in France and Belgium. The product
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
attracted illegal export refund subsidies at the expense of the Community budget, and OLAF investigations led to arrests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the fraud in adulterated butter ceased or diminished since then? I am more than willing to pay tribute when it should be paid and to give credit when it is due. If significant cases of investigation, arrest, prosecution and conviction have effectively closed down fraud in particular sectors, that is welcome. The anxiety is that professional fraudsters might, and probably will, turn their attentions elsewhere. Nevertheless, if there are successes, we should know about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A frustrating aspect of the legislative and governmental process is that often one reads a document, hears about a particular case, reads about it with interest and awaits with eager anticipation, bated breath and beads of sweat on one's brow the debate on the subject in European Standing Committee B, or a Delegated Legislation Committee. One lives in hope that the Government will have something further to say on the matter, only to have one's hopes dashed. I fear that the Minister had not intended to discuss adulterated butter, but if she would do so this afternoon or subsequently in writing, it would be greatly appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given media reports in Spain about suspicions of irregularities or fraud in the subsidies paid for flax production in Spain, and inquiries by OLAF and anti-corruption officials in Spain, what information can the Minister give us about the report on that important and worrying matter that has been forwarded to the competent judicial and administrative authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last April, OLAF opened an investigation into allegations of fraud in the award of tenders for EU projects in Slovakia. What is the position today, 10 months on from the opening of that investigation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given time constraints, I shall generously, and, as it will probably transpire, unwisely, omit to focus on preventive measures to combat fraud proposed in 1999 and will focus my remaining remarks on those emanating from 2000. Have all customs transit procedures now been computerised? If not, why not, and if so, has the Minister reached a conclusion about the effectiveness in deterrence or preventive terms of that computerisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is entailed in the proposal to reinforce current legislative provisions in order to improve the operation of the value added tax system in the internal market? Has that proposal been implemented? I pored over the documents and am genuinely unsighted on that point, but I have no doubt that the Minister, who is rarely lost for words and almost never unable to give an answer, will be able to release me from nescience and make me better informed.

Has the Council decision to allow member states to retain 25 per cent. of the amounts recorded for own resources as collection expenses been implemented, and if so, what have been the consequences? Is the new regulation to strengthen controls of banana imports in place and, if so, what difference has it made? Have all the proposals for the improvement of financial
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
management and the control of structural funds been implemented? What reform has been undertaken of the management of external aid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the development of a civil penalty regime. The Minister seemed attracted to the idea. I may be mistaken, but she gave the impression that she was relatively relaxed about the time scale for the development of such a regime. It is my understanding that the Treasury document said that further consideration would be given in 2001. The Minister hinted that the proposal would be made effective in 2002. Can she assure the Committee that primary legislation is not required in order to implement it or, if it is, that Government time will be found?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 2000, detected cases involving fraud and irregularities totalled 6,195 compared with 6,401 in 1999, a rise of 8 per cent. Is there a target for a financial saving in each of the next five years from the 2,031 million euros currently lost through fraud and irregularity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to focus on the four objectives of the action plan. I do not dissent from them, with one exception. I think that the Minister and I agree about the undesirability of the European public prosecutor proposal. In other respects, I suspect that we think that the objectives are sensible. We must take action as quickly as possible, so that we can deliver those objectives. The objectives refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"fostering a culture of cooperation between all the responsible authorities"</p></blockquote>
and reference is made to the "innovative methods" to be deployed by OLAF. What have they been so far? Will the Minister give specific examples of new approaches that have been deployed, and evidence of the beneficial consequences flowing from them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives demand
	<br><blockquote><p>"an inter-institutional approach to preventing and fighting fraud and corruption"</p></blockquote>
and demand that we lay guidelines to prevent conduct that is harmful to the EU. Have those guidelines been finalised? Are they in the Library? Can we see them? Presumably they are not secret. The objectives mention
	<br><blockquote><p>"strengthening the criminal law dimension of the fight against fraud".</p></blockquote>
There is reference to a European prosecutor. What is the current status of the consultation on the European prosecutor? I should like an assurance from the Government that they will resist and do everything necessary to prevent the passage of that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain the horrific increase in own resources fraud between 1999 and 2000 to more than 1 billion euros? Page 30 of the report states that the Court criticised the Commission for "insufficient progress"—its words, not my gloss—on the regulatory control framework for structural measures aimed at reducing ineligible or incorrect expenditure co-financed by the EU. Can we have an update on the efficacy of regulation 2064/97?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to focus closely on the important issue of the authority, and therefore effectiveness, of OLAF. I am pleased that it has been set up. Some staff have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
recruited, and some investigations have been conducted. We congratulate the office on the occasions on which it has been successful, and we are pleased with the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will share my concern that the European anti-fraud office could be hampered if other European institutions fail or refuse to respect its right and duty to investigate in detail all suspected cases of fraud. The hon. Lady will know that I am referring to the attitude of the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank. The ECB on 7 October 1999 and the EIB on 16 November 1999 stated that they did not recognise the explicit power of OLAF to act in their institutions, yet heads of state or government, as the hon. Lady will concur, agreed on the need to give full effect to anti-fraud rules. Given that the European Commission decided as long ago as 12 January 2000—two years and 31 days ago—to bring an action to the European Court of Justice, what is the position today? That is a serious question. If OLAF finds that its operations are frustrated and its writ does not run in important institutions that are themselves susceptible to fraud in the European Union, how can it be sure of identifying and acting effectively against those responsible for serious frauds in large-scale European institutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I interested in the hon. Gentleman's current line of argument. I am concerned about differential levels of fraud between different EU member states. If OLAF discovered a preponderance of fraud in one or two specific member states, might it not cause political difficulties for the European Union? It could lead to pressure being applied on OLAF not to be too rigorous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not flummoxed, but intrigued by what the hon. Gentleman said. He is in many respects charitable, but his last observation was not. He is cheekily opening up the possibility of a political motivation for the effective frustration of the work of the anti-fraud office within the European Union. If the hon. Gentleman asks me whether the thought had occurred to me, I will confess that it had. I hope that he is wrong and that there will be no such political motivation. I hope for a genuine determination to crack down on a problem that afflicts all EU taxpayers, though some to a greater degree than others. The idea that people in member states where fraud is extensive might favour the suppression of anti-fraud investigations that could save their own taxpayers money is anathema to me as to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that his suspicions are wrong, but I fear that they are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of gravely embarrassing the hon. Gentleman—I have made a regular practice of doing so recently—and reducing to zero what limited prospects he, an outspoken bastion of old Labour, has of advancement within the ranks of new Labour, I must tell him that he anticipated a point that I was about to make. Obviously, we are both interested in comparing the levels of fraud and misappropriation
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
between one member state and another. I shall be tempted to return to the point again soon. The trouble with the hon. Gentleman is that he tends to steal my best lines. Most of the time he has thoroughly sensible things to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 2000 a second investigation was undertaken into allegations of serious irregularities in possible breach of European Community public procurement regulations and in the use of European regional development fund and European social fund moneys. What is the upshot of the investigation by OLAF and the four different competent investigative authorities in the UK that were involved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the Commission's annual report on the protection of the Community's financial interests and the fight against fraud in 2000. The Minister will be aware that pages 33 to 68 cover several important administrative changes to checks and inspections. Many measures relate to other member states and I will therefore not dwell on them, unless provoked. However, those appertaining to the United Kingdom are a particularly fitting concern of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been the impact of section 126 of the Finance Act 1999 allowing interest to be charged on customs debts in accordance with regulation 2913/92? Is the Treasury satisfied that the guidance note from the former DETR to all Government offices in the regions, regarding the implementation of regulation 2064/97 and covering 5 per cent. checks on European regional development fund expenditure, has been heeded in practice, and what is the evidence for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the protocol between the former Department for Education and Employment and the European Commission providing assurances on the level of control and the framework of the European social fund now operational and if so what impact has it had? What assessment has the Minister made of the control plan for objective 5B and how has it impacted on the allocation of funds in our country? Is she content that all fraud investigations are, as intended, now undertaken within one national investigation service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a slightly confusing reference to the need for local investigative work still to take place, alongside the primacy to be attached to the national investigative service. I presume that it is intended that the overarching authority is vested in the national service and that local outlets that are charged with research feed into that national service. That is merely my surmise and I would like the authoritative factual verdict from the Minister herself. Can she explain the reference on page 44 of the Commission document to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Multi-disciplinary co-ordination: customs accounting systems aimed at a whole trader approach to control and debt management"?</p></blockquote>
None of us needs to be embarrassed at this point, Miss Widdecombe. It is conceivable that even you are a little uncertain—you may not be and you may reprimand for daring to suggest it—as to the meaning of customs accounting systems that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"aimed at a whole trader approach to control and debt management."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
If you are thoroughly seized both of the concept and its practical operation and result, I can only say, good for you. I am not so well advised on the matter. If the Minister can release me from my woeful ignorance about that I shall be doubly grateful to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the merger to form a single paying agency now taken effect as planned, and is it working smoothly? What has been the impact of the relaunch of the freephone fraud line by the anti-fraud unit of the Intervention Board Executive Agency? It is hotting up now, as they say, or as my English teacher said back in 1977 at page 321 of "Great Expectations", just as we were all falling asleep. I do not want that fate to befall members of the Committee. Although there has been some reordering to take account of the earlier question session, they will be pleased to know that I have reached no. 44 of 50 questions. I hope that they will not hold it against me if I try to finish before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the promised regular meetings of an interdepartmental group, previously led by MAFF, to discuss regulation 595/91 to co-ordinate investigative work on the common agricultural policy fraud taking place? Can the Minister assure me about that? Who is involved? What resources in time or staff terms have been allocated to that exercise? What have been the practical results of the internal audits undertaken by the Department for Education and Skills on European social fund expenditure? As dairy products from New Zealand are top of the list of 25 products most frequently the subject of fraud within the EU and the Commission noted in 2000 the steep rise in that—its words, not mine—what will be done and when to arrest and reverse that tide?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference is made on page 84 to cases when recovery fails through the negligence of a member state and the fact that the Commission might decide in such circumstances to invoke procedures provided for in three different EU regulations to charge the member state. Has that happened?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not refer to officials in this Committee: were I to do so, I am sure that I would be subject to the sternest ministrations of the Chair. I thus refer to no particular individual, but I just saw a mirage of a wagging pen. I just wondered whether it was mooted or bruited or starting to foment in the Minister's mind that she could respond to most of these questions later. I would be delighted if she could reply to as many questions as possible now. If she cannot, I would like some commitment that she will reply quickly in writing. She knows that I am keen to progress and conclude my investigations. In respect of three different EU regulations to charge the requisite member state for an irrecoverable debt, has any member state in fact been charged? If so, can we have details of individual cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are rightly proud in this country—and here I suspect consensus across the Committee—that both our public and commercial life is relatively free of corruption in comparison with many other countries. Will the Minister provide me, the Committee and—though I risk discriminating against him by so saying—the hon. Member for Luton, North, a snapshot of the level of fraud committed by British
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
individuals and organisations? Will she go one step further and provide some comparison with the performance of other EU member states? I ask not just to knock others or boast about ourselves, but because it is important to know where the problem principally lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's suspicion that anti-fraud procedures will not be rigorously invoked—because people have something to hide and would prefer it to remain under the carpet—may be unfounded, but I fear that it might prove all too well founded. We must know the position across the European Union. An EU league of shame on fraud, corruption, misappropriation, waste and negligence should be published. Will the Minister press for such a league table? Does she agree with the hon. Member for Luton, North and me that such a development is desirable? It would act as a form of competitive stimulus to the principal offending countries to do better. It is a stick, but carrots could be offered, too. That would have much to commend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister does not want to lose her reputation for robustness in preserving the good health of public finances. What applies in this country should also apply across the rest of the European Union, especially when joint resources have been pooled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the enormous relief of the Committee and probably of you, Miss Widdecombe, I shall conclude. The Minister has adopted a constructive approach, which is appreciated and respected. As she said, measures are being taken. Nevertheless, a huge task lies ahead in identifying and counteracting the spiralling cost and incidence of fraud across the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister press the Commission more effectively to use its existing powers before clamouring for more? Does she agree that complex rules and a labyrinthine decision-making structure can be the enemies of fair play in the EU? Does she acknowledge that, far from stemming the flow of fraudulent behaviour, such rules and structures all too often act as a green light to the sophisticated professional fraudster? The Opposition's, the Government's and the European Commission's fight must be against those who purloin resources that are not theirs— resources that should be used to improve the lives of the law-abiding majority of citizens throughout the member states of the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been a member of this Committee for about five years. It began with almost every meeting being an acrimonious and bitter struggle across the divide, but has become almost uncomfortably harmonious. The extent of support from the hon. Member for Buckingham for the Government's position is surprising but welcome. However, I feel compelled occasionally to throw a stone in the millpond, because I want to tease out the facts and this is a serious matter. Indeed, that is why the European Scrutiny Committee has referred it to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will not take this too badly, but I am concerned about the distinction between error and fraud. There is a spectrum from error to irregularity—where the jury is out and we do not know whether there is fraud—to definite fraud and then general corruption. Where we are on that line in the European Union is important. The extent to which these are mathematical errors, perhaps because there are not enough civil servants to do the job, is one thing, but deliberate mischief is something else. That distinction must be explored, perhaps in a future sitting or EU report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the comparison between nations because I have been told so often that there are differences in cultures between the various European nations. It may be that we are one of the guilty parties and if so, we should clean up our act. If fraud or dishonesty is not addressed and restrained in any culture, it is bad. One can slip quickly into a life in which one takes fraud, dishonesty and corruption as the norm and honesty as an astonishing exception. That is an unhealthy society, and I want to see one that is open, honest and regular. That is why I am so concerned about alcohol and tobacco smuggling, which introduce many of our citizens into what is effectively petty crime. It is not good for them or society, and I would like there to be many more customs officers so that we can police the ports much more strongly than we do now. I have written to the Chancellor about that in the past and no doubt will do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer that to relaxing our stance and saying, "Well, what's the matter with a little bit of corruption or fiddling?" It is not right. If people are poor and need to buy cheap things, there is something wrong with their incomes and they should not be led into thinking that the way to overcome that is to get something off the back of a lorry. It may be an old-fashioned and puritanical view, but it is one that I hold strongly. If we are going to have a decent society, we must take such matters seriously, which is why today's debate is so important. It may be that fraud does not account for a great amount of gross domestic product or the total economy of the European Union, but it is significant politically, culturally and socially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about enlargement because there is a correlation between poverty and fraud and, particularly, corruption. By and large, poor countries are often those with a high level of corruption. I know that from speaking to constituents who come from very poor countries and tell me that those countries are corrupt. It seems as if the only way to deal with that is to become better off. If a country becomes better off, corruption can be gradually dealt with as the people become better fed, housed and educated. They do not have to scramble desperately for every crumb every day of their lives, which is true of too many of our fellow human beings around the world today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enlargement is a worry because many of the countries coming into the European Union are much poorer than us, and the scope for corruption might be
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
much greater because of the correlation between poverty and corruption. We must ensure that the European Union is regular, open, transparent and clean, and does not practice fraud. We must never tell any country joining the EU that if it keeps quiet, we will turn a blind eye to a few more agricultural subsidies. That is not the way forward. We should establish an honest regime and government in the EU, so that if countries are poor and need assistance, we can help them legitimately with substantial transfers and other forms of assistance to enable them to develop economically and acquire equality within the European Union. Such a challenge may be difficult; nevertheless that is the way in which we should operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is relatively new to her post, but she may be not surprised to hear that what I am about to say I have said to her predecessors on several occasions—having been a Member of the Committee for so long. The CAP is a serious problem. It is a natural field for corruption and fraud and, indeed, it has been identified as such on many occasions. The way forward is not only to deal with fraud, but to reform the CAP, and I do not mean just tinkering at the edges. The French said at Nice that they did not mind reform as long as nothing was changed. They are resistant to reform of the CAP. They are mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some sensible, radical reforms could be made to the CAP, one of which may be to change the whole system into a deficit financing system rather than a price maintenance system, the sort of system that we used to have in Britain when we had the farm price review before we joined the EU. It was a good way in which to subsidise our agriculture. We could target better and the system would not be so prone to corruption. That is one possible reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many areas do not need subsidies and if we repatriated agricultural subsidies, we would overcome some of the distortions in the fiscal transfers between member states. There are serious problems; some rich countries are substantial net recipients from the European budget, while others are net losers, even though that does not correlate with the standard of living in those particular countries. It depends on whether there is a big agricultural sector. For example, Denmark gains and we lose. Beginning the process of repatriating agricultural subsidies would be a sensible way forward as would be moving towards a system of deficit financing rather than price maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that was raised earlier was the 11 billion euros underspend, particularly on structural funds. Given that we benefit from the structural funds to a much greater extent than other countries, we may be the losers because of that underspend. I keep writing down a pound sign instead of a euro sign—it is a terrible habit that I must correct. The 11 billion euros underspend on structural funds is serious. We might not have such a big deficit in our budget arrangements with Europe if it were not for the fact that there was such a substantial underspend. Hopefully, when we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
bring forward further spend in later years, it might possibly develop the poorer and depressed areas of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there an analogy in the hon. Gentleman's opinion between the underspend to which he has referred in structural funds expenditure and the underspend that is being regularly recorded in the departmental accounts of several British Government Departments? Is the cause the same or are the creatures different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but I do not know the answer. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister has a better grip on such issues than I have. I should be interested to know the answer, but I suspect that our underspend is because people are being rightly cautious with public money. That is how it should be. I should like to see that money brought forward in future years, so that we can compensate particularly in health, education, the police and elsewhere. I am sure that the Government are taking proper account of those underspends and will bring forward extra spend to compensate for them in future years. Public services have been desperately underfunded for many decades and the Chancellor made the welcome remark only yesterday that he was not going to restrain extra spending on the health service on the instruction of the European Union. That is right, as we spend far less on our health service than do many other EU countries, and it is unacceptable that we should be told not to spend more on it. I applaud the Chancellor for his action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could make several other points, but these are the most important ones that concern me. I hope that I did not sound too moralistic, but probity in public spending is important. If people are going to respect Governments and vote enthusiastically to choose between Governments of different colours, they must believe that those Governments will run their countries and public finances properly and sensibly, and that they will do their best to eliminate any fraud and corruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to hon. Members who have already been through a marathon session, but as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee who referred the documents, I was keen to hear how they would be debated. I hope that more members of the European Scrutiny Committee will follow the documents into the various Standing Committees to which we refer them to see how they are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham reminded me of an occasion when I served on a Standing Committee with my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). I know that when I compare the hon. Gentleman to the Father of the House, he will take it as the compliment that it is meant to be. When my hon. Friend said "and twenty-seventhly" to an amendment, the Whip decided that it was time to pull the stops and go home. By that time it was four o'clock in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
It is funny how things come together. I was also reminded that the first Dalyell of The Binns—the family home of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow—made his fortune from adulterated butter, which he bought from various parts of Scotland and sold to the armies of Europe for axle grease. That is how The Binns came to be established as my hon. Friend's family home. It is strange how things that go around come around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simple matter, which has not taken up much of the Committee's time, is the directive on excise duty on manufactured tobacco products. That may be a minor matter before the House, but it was of particular interest to those of us who were concerned about how to deal with fraud and the trade that is costing this country £3 billion in excise duty. One way is to agree a common approach throughout the EU to the duties applied to manufactured tobacco and cigarettes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will see from the document before them that the excise duties were originally proposed to be at least 57 per cent. of the tax, inclusive of the retail selling price, or 70 euros for each 1,000 cigarettes. EU countries did not accept that, and I am not sure what the Government's view was, as the European Scrutiny Committee never found out which Government did or did not vote for it in the Council of Ministers. We know only that one or two countries opposed it. We may have supported the proposal that the duties should be agreed throughout the European Union, but the compromise was 60 euros for each 1,000 cigarettes. That would mean several derogations, which would allow countries to come to those stages slowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister expect that that approach to excise duties will be effective, especially on cigarettes? The EU made a good attempt to use the tax laws to pull the rug from under the feet of those who are making quite a bit of money from buying cigarettes in one country and smuggling them into this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the documents will be only the beginning of an agreement. Tax can force people to take a more legal approach to the purchasing and sale of goods from the EU. As long as we have such disparate taxation and excise duty throughout the EU, there will always be people who attempt to use illegal methods to make money. It is not just the small trader, as we know. Oil tankers come into this country that have been specially constructed to store millions of cigarettes in and around their legal cargo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to hear the hon. Member for Buckingham speak up more strongly for what has been done in setting up the European anti-fraud office. Commissioner Kinnock's approach and the remit that he took on board is beginning to make some sense of and give some muscle to the anti-fraud process in the European Union. That is not a partisan point. The structure of the European Union and the way that it disperses funds and gives home countries great leeway in how they apply it means that operational standards in some countries benefit the local economies, but do not necessarily provide the best accounting practice. Indeed, in some cases, they are fraudulent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
One case caught my attention. I was a member of this Committee before I became a member of the European Scrutiny Committee. The types of tobacco grown in the European Union are very damp and so do not dry out quickly. They could be moved around by organised cartels of what was then called the tobacco mafia to various parts of Europe. Payments from the same fund were then made once, twice, three times and occasionally even five times for the same leaf. When investigators got close to the centre of that ring, the person responsible in the European Commission for dealing with it either jumped, fell or was pushed from a fifth storey window in Brussels to his death. There was clearly money and danger in dealing in some of these fraudulent practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the response to that of the European Union was rather strange. We reduced the number of tobaccos that could be grown to eight from 24, but none of it is ever of a fit standard to be used in the EU because of its tar content. We then gave export subsidies to have it exported to Africa and the Caribbean. I am told that we have since moved on. We do not give export subsidies but we still export poisonous tobaccos to other parts of the world and spend more than 1 billion euros in the process. That caught my attention and I have kept up my interest ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The coming of OLAF is a vast improvement. I should have thought that the Opposition might applaud the way that it is structured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point about exporting surplus. Is it not exactly the CAP system of price maintenance that creates the surpluses that must be exported—dumped in effect—on poorer countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has always been one of my principled objections to the concept of paying the producer a certain sum of money to produce even though there is no use for the product. I hope that we will move beyond that when the CAP is reformed. If we do not, enlargement of the EU will turn the corruption hell into a corruption mountain because it is quite an attractive way of bending the rules. All the practices have already been tried out by present EU members and will be exported quicker than anything else to the incoming economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one reservation, which I think I share with members of the European Scrutiny Committee. It is strange that the hon. Member for Buckingham seemed to see it as a problem. The fact that OLAF was set up within the Commission concerned some of us who wanted a completely independent body to investigate fraud. It has accountancy and other independences but it is not independent of the Commission. It is part of the Commission, so it still has some way to go to fulfil my personal aspirations for its use. Its link to Eurojust will be strong as there is now open dialogue on that. That will make it much stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Although change would have happened anyway, there is clearly an impetus from 11 September. I hope that the justice and investigation systems of Europe will come closer together, because as long as they are independent, we will never have the tight control that we require or the tight link between the administrative, justice and investigative departments of the European Union. It is important to have a decent case management system and an established IT system. This is the only year in which it can be claimed that OLAF is running the current system, rather than the previous one. It has carried over quite a lot, and has made massive strides. Section 1 of the document contains good examples of its activities. The example of bananas can be replicated in every section of the EU budget where OLAF has found substantial fraudulent practices. The textile sector is valued at 30 million euros, and it is quite common to find such a value listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the prospect of enlargement, I have visited several applicant countries as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee and the all-party group on European Union accession. When I consider the administrative, legal and policing abilities of those countries, I worry about what will happen. I echo, and possibly amplify, what my hon. Friend said. It is already clear that the first thing done by some countries, such as Romania, is to set up a methodology to copy what they think that they are coming into. That is the problem. They think that they are coming into a system that is capitalism run riot, and that the point is to get money from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been to conferences of applicant countries, at which they discuss only how to get money from the EU. We have moved on and are talking about a common political and humanitarian purpose. However, people from former eastern bloc countries clearly view the EU as a capitalist system where the purpose is to get as much out of it as possible. Sadly, many people are already translating that as a way of extracting money illegally. A Lithuanian gang working in Spain was the first group to counterfeit euros.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give OLAF more resources. I was disappointed to see the Opposition point-scoring in attacking the slight growth in the percentage of the EU budget that is spent on administration. They did not realise that they were attacking the money that is being spent on OLAF. OLAF is part of the administration budget, because it is part of the Commission. Money is going into fraud investigation, systems, officers and intelligence that will help us to cope with the already sophisticated fraud in the EU, and that will prepare us for an onslaught of the most innovative fraudulent practices that we have ever seen in Europe when enlargement comes. People think that they are coming into a large organisation that passes round money and that they can siphon it off if they are skilful enough in accounting or counterfeiting.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
It astonished me just how many people with whom I talked in those countries could cite case after case in which people from the eastern bloc believe that they will have more access to easy money in the EU. OLAF is one way to prevent that from becoming a reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend is saying, as it confirms some of my concerns. The EU is likely to contain a large number of member states in future years, and fiscal transfers will be appropriate, as some countries will be very poor and some will be rich. Does he agree that where fiscal transfers are appropriate, it might be better to make them to Governments who would be responsible for allocating funds in their own countries, rather than having a system that allocates funds directly to producers, or whatever? Governments are much more likely to police the spending of that money more carefully, as their own budgets would also be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for placing that suggestion on the record. I am sure that those who are interested in the enlargement of Europe will consider it. I would not like to venture an opinion on which system we will use. It is clear that in some applicant countries, large sections of the economy are entirely subsidised by Departments. They dole out money to people to keep them underemployed and prevent them from flooding from the country to the towns and overwhelming industries. There is a lot of undermanning and systems that we would not approve of but which keep their economies afloat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bring them into the European Union in a free, open market and with proper structural funds that help them through their troubles, and not get into a situation in which those who see the European Union as a rip-off society that they want to join can get away with it. Such people undermine the ability of their own citizens to gain greatly from being members of the European Union, as they should. I am very pro-enlargement, but cautious, and I want OLAF to be strengthened, because it is one way to ensure that the experiment helps all people and does not enrich the most corrupt people in those countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.21 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an enjoyable debate with interesting contributions from both sides. I am personally delighted by the energy and attention to detail shown by the hon. Member for Buckingham, although I should say straight away that I reject completely his allegation that the European Community is somehow involved in a smash and grab raid on taxpayers' money. That bears no relation to reality. I reject also his claim that the Government are not interested in clamping down on fraud and irregularity. Any level of fraud cannot be tolerated, and we are committed to ensuring that we clamp down on it whenever it is found. That is why the UK is such a strong supporter of reform of the Commission, which I will return to later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept that there is a difference between fraud and irregularity. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned a spectrum, with fraud
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
and corruption at one end and irregularity and minor error of detail at the other. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where each transaction lies on that spectrum, but irregularities can involve merely a simple error—failing to complete a form within the EU timetable, for example. As such, while we remain committed to combating irregularities, they cannot be interpreted as synonymous with fraud, and it is very important to distinguish between the two. The Government are committed to combating both, as well as to streamlining procedures and simplifying regulations so that it is as simple as possible for people to comply with them and for irregularities to cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree also with the hon. Member for Buckingham that the establishment of OLAF is not an end in itself. It is the start of a process of reform to which we are committed. As he and the rest of the Committee are no doubt aware, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made a statement in the House in 1999 to call for root and branch reform of the Commission. It was the UK that circulated a paper of reform ideas to the Commission and other member states prior to the Berlin Council. In the same year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor called at ECOFIN for a full prevention office as part of that programme of reform. He suggested an office that remained in the Commission but was independent of it and had stronger powers and greater independence than its predecessor. Those proposals were warmly welcomed by other member states, which are also committed to reform of the Commission and the crackdown on fraud and irregularities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The office is now established and has started doing good work. Several investigations have been successfully carried out, and I will return to some later. The hon. Gentleman highlighted the difficulties that OLAF is having with recruitment of staff. OLAF wants to recruit highly skilled and motivated people, and it is much better to get the right people than merely to fill the numbers. So far 260 people have been taken on. It still has some way to go to fill its full complement, but I am sure that it will achieve that before too long. It is committed to employing more staff and to encouraging people to apply, but it is also redeploying some of its existing staff while not jeopardising employment in the rest of the organisation, and it is clearly working under considerable constraints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with the priority that OLAF has initially placed on combating internal cases of fraud and corruption. Internal corruption must be eradicated if we are truly to establish a new culture within the Commission, and OLAF's priority must be to promote cultural change as a mechanism to drive out fraud and irregularity within the entire system. OLAF now has its own team of magistrates and judicial advisers to ensure that its investigations are thorough, while upholding the rights of people under investigation. Over the longer term, that will enhance the credibility and authority of OLAF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OLAF also has a strong independent director, who was appointed after consultation with the Council and European Parliament. The director will have statutory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
protection from dismissal. That should lead to an enhancement of his authority. He will be able to open investigations on his own initiative, draw up reports and have immediate and unannounced access to buildings. Institutions will have to report to him on whether they are following up recommendations, how they have interpreted them and how they are carrying them out. The director reports regularly to the Council and European Parliament, so that they will be alerted if his reports are not being carried through and acted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OLAF will be a strong force for change, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) drew attention to the positive work that it is performing. OLAF has put in place a network of anti-fraud communicators to establish permanent contact between the communication, public relations and training co-ordination unit of OLAF and its national counterparts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Buckingham pointed out, there is a European freephone system that anyone in the member states can use to report a fraud. That should be an effective way of starting to change the culture, and of encouraging people to report fraud. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman current figures on how many phone calls have been received, but if he wishes to pursue the matter, we will supply him with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman did not ask for the freephone number for the United Kingdom, which I can give him if he wishes to use it to report fraud. For the record, it is 0800 963 595. If he has any cases to report, the telephonists will be delighted to hear from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham referred to the transparency under which OLAF operates. The OLAF manual has been introduced to improve its working methods and procedures. The aim is to ensure that its work is transparent and effective, while respecting the appropriate legal basis and human rights. The office has also replaced its old database, which had been criticised, particularly in the Court of Auditors report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of OLAF's work will be judged on how it carries out individual investigations of fraud. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the case of fraud in the importation of bananas, the co-operation with the Italian authorities on that, and how effective it had been. He also mentioned the fraud involving adulterated butter, which was a major success for OLAF, working in co-operation again with the Italian authorities. There is also the Spanish flax case: OLAF and the Spanish Fiscalia Anti-Corrupcion have been working together to ensure that that had been thoroughly investigated. The report has been forwarded to the competent judicial and administrative authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman did not mention OLAF's report into EU subsidies paid in Slovakia. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course, I may have not heard him, because he made numerous points and if he
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
did point to the case, I did not catch wind of it. That case was also very important. I admit that I do not have the exact levels of fraud to hand that occurred since the conclusion of each individual investigation. However, logic leads one to conclude that fraud in those areas has been reduced as a consequence of the investigations. I hope that we will see real evidence of reductions in irregularity and fraud as a result of the investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When OLAF investigates Commission expenditure, the Commission has ultimate responsibility under the treaty for budget execution. That responsibility includes instituting effective fraud prevention procedures, and it must follow up reports from OLAF. I hope that that will contribute to cultural change in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OLAF is only one aspect of the reforms that have been carried out and that the Government have been proactive in backing. The name of Neil Kinnock has already been mentioned in Committee, and the Government strongly support the fundamental change that is being led by the Vice-President of the Commission—Neil Kinnock himself. We need a Commission that is strong, effective and respected. Only modernisation of the Commission will improve the way in which it uses taxpayer's money and bring it in line with the best of public sector practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progress has been made. The introduction of the code of conduct for Commissioners and Commission officials has been introduced, which has overhauled disciplinary procedures. Initiatives to encourage promotion on merit and better representation of women have been introduced. A whistleblower's charter was introduced and measures on senior appointments have been taken, including plans for senior officials to be subjected to a system of appraisals involving outside assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nice treaty changes formally empower the President of the Commission to require the resignation of a Commissioner. I am sure that the hon. Member for Buckingham agrees that that is an important change that will give the President greater power to control the way in which the Commission may use taxpayer's money most prudently and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms of the Commission are wide ranging, and they will lead to a culture change. However, we cannot expect such changes to be achieved overnight. We must ensure that everyone is kept on board during the long process of change. All the key players inside and outside the Commission must be persuaded of the merits of reform if real change is to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham referred to the recast financial regulation. Of course, it has taken time to build a consensus around what such a regulation should be. The recast financial regulation is a major part of the reform that is being implemented in the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial changes are being considered, and several bring the European Union budgetary rules into line with those in the United Kingdom system. However, the hon. Gentleman asked specifically when such changes might be brought into force. I put on record our appreciation of the efforts of the Spanish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
presidency, which took seriously the reform of the financial regulation and made it a priority. As a result, there is a new impetus behind that financial regulation being agreed. While it involves complete rewriting of the financial rule book, we still believe that that considerable reform will be in place by next year. That will be a real achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial regulation will bring about real change. For example, it will define clear roles and responsibilities for those involved in financial transactions for the first time. Those who make operational decisions will bear responsibility for ensuring that money is properly controlled and spent—a reform that is long overdue. The new regulation will make objective setting and evaluation integral to the budgetary process. There will be a clear delineation between those authorising expenditure and those in charge of internal audits, which should lead to significant improvements in the way in which EU money is spent and how the scope of fraud and irregularity can be minimised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred particularly to the experience of the French with the CAP. In fact, it was the first of a long list of questions. If he will forgive me, I shall not have time to answer them all today, but I shall deal with some of them. While I shall not comment on all his specific claims, I must point out that we are taking fraud in the CAP extremely seriously. It is already clear that those CAP reform measures that have been introduced will lead again to a reduction in the level of fraud and irregularity. They will bring a much more transparent process into the delivery of payments to farmers. Let us look back to 1992. While there has been a significant increase in the number of reported cases of fraud in the CAP, the value of such fraud has not risen in proportion. That is due largely to the effect of switching aid away from areas such as export refunds and market support that are susceptible to large-scale fraud and irregular practices towards direct payments to farmers that are far easier to control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farm-based schemes include ceilings on totals for payment. They specify the levels of control that each member state must attain. They are tightly controlled under the integrated administration and control system. The schemes also include provision for automatic application of penalties for applicants found to have committed an irregularity. As that process becomes more developed in the future, we should see a further diminution in the level of fraud and irregularity in the agricultural budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members referred to the large budget surplus at the end of 2000. It is indeed large and unprecedented and one that we do not believe is lightly to recur from year to year. As I said earlier, the Commission is rightly criticised for having such a large budget surplus, which accounts for 14 per cent. of the total. It is clear that not only should it have acted earlier, but its forecasting methods need to be improved. I agree with the report of the Court of Auditors that, if the Commission needs to use the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
appropriate powers in-year to return funds to member states if a similar situation arises in future, it should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the precise make-up of that 11.6 billion euros surplus, about 3 billion euros were revenue because more own resources were collected than were budgeted for and more than 8 billion euros were on the expenditure side, mainly because of under-implementation on the structural funds side. The surplus led to a reduction in member states' contribution to 2001 budget that was implemented by the supplementary and amending budget. As a result, the UK's contribution was reduced by 1.7 billion euros in the supplementary and amending budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should hate to give the impression that we are not concerned about the size of the overspend. Of course we are. In mitigation, I should point out that the size of the budget is difficult to forecast, partly because CAP spending is itself subject to exchange rate fluctuations and price changes that are difficult to forecast, and partly because 85 percent, of the budget is managed by member states themselves, and the Commission is therefore dependent on member states' expenditure forecasts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although an underspend is not desirable, it is better to have an underspend than poor value for money as member states rush to implement projects that are not good value or clearly defined or what they would choose in the longer run if they had more time. That is one reason why structural funds involve a procedure called N + 2, in which the hon. Gentleman may be interested. Member states have up to three years to use money allocated to them. That process is considered better than member states rushing to projects merely for the sake of meeting a deadline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend undertake to investigate the extent to which Britain has lost out as a result of the underspend in the structural funds budget? Might the Treasury be able to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comment. It is important that we do not lose out as a result of that underspend, and I undertake to investigate the matter. However, we must not forget that we receive a refund of any moneys that are not spent, and we have a period in which money allocated can be used. A project might, therefore, be postponed rather than not implemented. We do not lose out, but I shall of course ask the question and tell him if we have further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members raised the issue of EU enlargement and asked what will happen under an enlarged EU and whether candidate, or accession, countries will have the same financial control that is expected or taken for granted in other member states, and what impact that will have on the wider EU budget. The 12 candidate countries currently in accession negotiations must meet minimum EU standards of financial control. That is not to minimise the problems involved. Clearly candidate countries will have difficulties in raising themselves to the appropriate standards. However, as part of the negotiations they must show that they have a legal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
framework that supports accountable financial control systems and that the Government have put or are committed to putting in place legislation and systems to ensure legal and effective use of EU funds, thus minimising fraud and irregularities. The EU will continue to monitor closely the financial control systems of new member states in order to ensure full compliance with the EU acquis prior to accession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It almost goes without saying that member states will try to support candidate countries in the process, in which the UK is actively involved. Candidate countries attend an annual financial control conference with EU15, which gives them the opportunity to discuss areas of concern and common interest, and there are various bilateral contacts between individual member states and potential accession countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK has published information on the UK system of financial control on the Treasury website so that candidate countries that are interested in taking advantage of that information can do so. We remain committed to working with them to improve their financial control systems as part of the accession process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham also mentioned SAPARD—the special accession programme for agricultural and rural development—which finances major agricultural and rural development projects and has an annual budget of 520 million euros. Safeguards are in place with regard to the allocation of funds within those projects: a SAPARD agency in a candidate country must be accredited by the Commission—the Commissioner's usual ex-ante approval is waived; the programme must also be approved; and there is an annual financing agreement, as well as a multi-annual agreement, between the Commission and each candidate country to ensure that financial control is as stringent as possible, and that taxpayers' money is used to best effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham also mentioned that it is stated on page 84 of "Protection of the Communities' Financial Interests and the Fight against Fraud" that the Commission can charge member states with amounts to be recovered, and he asked whether that power had ever been used. Those charges are known as financial corrections, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that not only have the powers been used—albeit infrequently—but the UK, in common with other member states, has occasionally been the subject of financial corrections. If the hon. Gentleman is interested, I will write to him with some examples of when that happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the subject of the European public prosecutor, and he suggested that the Government might agree with the Opposition that the establishment of such a prosecutor would not be the best way to move forward. I am happy to say that he is right about that. The hon. Gentleman asked about the status of the Commission's latest proposals, with regard to that subject. At the end of 2001, the Commission issued a Green Paper on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
establishment of a European public prosecutor. Responses to that are invited until June 2002, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will respond. The Commission will then consider whether to submit another proposal for treaty change to provide a legal base for the establishment of the European public prosecutor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office will initiate a wide-ranging consultation to enable people to have input about how the United Kingdom should respond to that. However, as I have said, the UK does not back the idea of a European public prosecutor, in the circumstances that have been proposed. It supports closer judicial cooperation within the European Union to ensure that criminals cannot use legal differences between member states to evade the law, and that British citizens can exercise their legal rights when they travel to other EU countries. That is an important point. The best way to achieve that is not by establishing a European public prosecutor, but by ensuring that there is mutual recognition of court decisions between countries. The different legal systems of Scotland, England and Wales co-operate in that way, and we have successfully coexisted for centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North returned to the idea that there should be more customs staff on our borders. I agree with that, and I point to the announcement that there will be almost an extra 1,000 customs staff. Customs officers have now been given not only the numbers, but the tools that they need to crack down on fraud, particularly with regard to tobacco smuggling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will they be keeping a particular watch on white vans, which frequently come to my constituency loaded with large quantities of cigarettes and alcohol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ruth Kelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initial indications are that they have been keeping a particularly close eye on white vans, as all the results suggest that we are on track to meet our tough targets on cracking down on cigarette smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that customs authorities have effectively tackled the problems that he faces in his constituency. I reiterate that the majority of illicit cigarettes—80 per cent. according to customs—do not come from other EU states, but from places such as Dubai, Vietnam and China. Harmonising EU duty rates would have minimal impact on the UK problem because the products are sourced further afield. As I have already outlined, our customs staff are already successfully tackling it. In 2000 tobacco smuggling was reduced by 76 per cent. My hon. Friends might like to report that back to their constituencies to demonstrate the seriousness with which the Government are dealing with smuggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that time is running out. I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions and sorry if I have not had the time to deal with all their points. The hon. Member for Buckingham asked 50 questions and it is unrealistic to expect them all to be addressed here and now. It is better to provide more detailed information later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
In conclusion, the latest ECA report has once again highlighted the need for reform, which is an issue that we take seriously. We need reform of the Commission itself, of the way it recruits, of the reward and incentive structures it provides for its staff and, perhaps most importantly, of the responsibilities it places on officials to deliver. Also important are reform of the financial rule book, the introduction of clear principles of budgetary management, the integration of objectives and evaluation in the budgetary mechanism, the clear designation of accountability at official level, reforming the means of tackling fraud and waste, the creation of a fully resourced OLAF and Eurojust to build co-operation between member states and the requirement for a more independent internal audit service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reforms are under way. The Government support the changed agenda because it is the best way to reduce errors and to tackle fraud and waste.
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Although it may take several years before the results can be seen, I am confident that in time this tremendous reform effort by the Commission will bear fruit. We continue to value the input of ECA and OLAF and we are grateful for their detailed reports, which are a true testament to their diligence. We look forward to their further confirmation in the years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
