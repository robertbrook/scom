Promotion of the Use of Biofuels in Road Transport</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that both Ministers present wish to make an opening statement, as is permitted by the Standing Order. After the statements, questions will be taken as usual, and it will be for the Ministers to decide who will respond to each question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions</span><span class='membercontribution'> (Mr. David Jamieson): It is a pleasure, Mr. Benton, to serve under you, and a considerable pleasure to introduce today's debate.<br><br>
The issue is of great interest to me and to my Department; it has the potential to make a large impact on the United Kingdom's agriculture and transport sectors and it is right that the Committee should focus on it.<br><br>
The Scrutiny Committee has recommended that we consider three Commission documents, all relating to the encouragement of the use of alternative fuels and, in particular, the promotion of a substantial biofuels sector within the European Union.<br><br>
The three documents are the Commission's communication on alternative fuels for road transportation and on a set of measures to promote the use of biofuels, which, for ease, I shall refer to as the communication; the draft directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport, which I shall call the targets directive, and the draft directive amending directive 92/81/EEC with regard to the possibility of applying a reduced rate of excise duty on certain mineral oils containing biofuels and on biofuels, which I shall call the tax directive. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General will address her remarks to that.<br><br>
The Commission's Green Paper "Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply" published in November 2000, highlighted security of supply considerations and climate change as being the two main drivers for energy policy in the foreseeable future. It identified transport as a key strategic sector, concluding that the sustainability of the sector would be greatly improved if 20 per cent. of transport fuel could be supplied by alternative—that is, non-mineral oil—sources.<br><br>
The communication is, with the two directives, the Commission's reaction to this strategy; it examines which fuels have the potential to replace 5 per cent. Or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
more of conventional petrol and diesel supplies. In conclusion, it picks three fuels—hydrogen, natural gas and biofuels—as its winners and recognises the contribution that more energy efficient vehicle technology, such as hybrid electric engines, can make.<br><br>
In many ways, the communication reflects the approach in the strategy that the Government have pursued for the encouragement of alternative fuels, and that set out in the Government's recently published draft strategy "Powering Future Vehicles". That invites comment on a target of 8 to 12 per cent. of all cars sold to be low-carbon by 2012.<br><br>
The Government are encouraging the development of alternative fuels in the UK through the green fuels challenge, which enables the piloting of novel fuels and technologies on a largely tax-free basis, to build our knowledge and experience of the widest possible range of potentially beneficial alternative fuels.<br><br>
We are also committed to the imminent introduction of a 20p duty rebate for biodiesel relative to its mineral diesel equivalent. That will help to encourage the development of a significant market for biodiesel in the UK; a number of firms have already announced their intention to invest in production facilities and we know of at least one supermarket chain planning to use biodiesel in its lorries. The Government will keep a close eye on the outcome of the green fuel challenge pilots and the technological advances taking place in the United Kingdom and abroad to discover whether further incentives for other biofuels such as bioethanol would be beneficial.<br><br>
Against the background of considerable Government support for the alternative fuel sector in the United Kingdom, the Commission has published the two draft directives on the encouragement of biofuels in Europe. It might be helpful if I and the Paymaster General, who is responsible for the second draft directive on the application of excise duty to biofuels, described the key measures contained in these draft texts and the Government's position.<br><br>
The draft directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport proposes the setting of mandatory targets for the sale of biofuels for transport in each of the member states, starting at 2 per cent. in 2005 and rising to 5.75 per cent. by 2010.<br><br>
The Government have several concerns about the Commission's mandatory, one-size-fits-all-countries approach. First, with regard to the directive's narrow scope, the communication stresses the need for greater diversification in Europe's fuel supply. It is perverse that the draft directive specifies only one category of fuel—biofuels—which the Government believe could preclude the development of alternative fuel types such as hydrogen and natural gas. Also, the framework of the directive is fuel specific, not output specific, in stark contrast to the Government strategy of setting incentives in terms of the achievement of the low-carbon outcomes that are wanted, leaving the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
way open for the best and most cost-efficient ways of achieving the outcomes. In considering the proposals in the draft directive, we also need to ensure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are upheld.<br><br>
It will be clear from my comments that the Government actively support the development of a viable biofuels market in the UK. That is not at issue. We merely question whether an approach built around the imposition of mandatory, uniform targets for biofuels use across the European Union, oblivious to the unique national circumstances of individual member states, represents the best method of implementation. That is why the Government have argued in Brussels for a widening of the scope of the directive to cover renewable fuels as well as biofuels, and the introduction of indicative rather than mandatory targets, so that countries can pursue strategies more appropriate to their own national circumstances.<br><br>
The UK has not been alone in expressing these concerns. Most member states share our concerns and are making similar noises about the appropriateness of the action. It is clear that the draft as presented to the Committee will be unacceptable to the majority of member states.<br><br>
Unfortunately, it is difficult to present the detail of the proposals and the Government's position in the time available. However, I hope that I have provided enough information on the areas within my responsibility to help stimulate discussion, and I look forward to answering any questions that hon. Members may have on the documents under my responsibility.</span></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General</span><span class='membercontribution'>(Dawn Primarolo): My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has covered the broad thrust of the proposals and the Government's approach in encouraging the use of alternative environmentally friendly fuels. He referred to the green fuel challenge. I shall focus on the tax directive, which is currently being discussed within the framework for tax.<br><br>
I shall briefly explain what progress has been made with the draft directive proposed by the Commission. The directive allows member states to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on some mineral oils containing biofuels and non-biofuels. It proposes that the duty reduction should be 50 per cent. of the normal rate of excise duty on the corresponding fuel. The proposal would make it mandatory for member states introducing reduced rates for biofuels to adjust and take account of changes in raw material prices and, in particular, the price of crude oil. The Commission wants to ensure that in the event of a sustained rise in crude oil prices, the lower tax rate would not overcompensate for the extra cost of manufacturing biofuels.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The Government believe that the principle of making it easier for member states to set a lower rate of fuel duty on cleaner fuel such as biofuels should be welcomed. As members of the Committee will know, we have already applied for a derogation from the current mineral oils directive for biofuels. It is reasonable to have a lower minimum rate that supports fuels for which there are environmental benefits. Indeed, if the proposed directive were already in force, there would be no need for the UK to have sought the derogation, which we hope to introduce when the Finance Bill is enacted.<br><br>
As it stands, however, the proposed directive has a number of unacceptable features. In particular, the proposal for a minimum duty rate for biofuels linked to member states' current duty rates for the relevant conventional fuels is inconsistent with the general approach of having a common minimum rate for each product across the Community. It would constrain the UK's ability to have the same biofuels duty rate as any other member state, should we wish to do so, simply because the UK has a higher standard diesel duty rate.<br><br>
Linking the duty reduction to the price of oil is also too prescriptive. It would make the system difficult to administer and run counter to the UK policy of deliberately not linking fuel duty directly to the oil price. In view of those concerns, although the Government have welcomed the broad principle of allowing member states to give tax incentives for biofuels, we have questioned the detail of the proposals and are seeking appropriate amendments. I must stress that the UK is by no means alone in having reservations about the current proposal and other member states have far more serious concerns about the draft directive. In fact the majority of member states find it unacceptable.<br><br>
If there are specific questions with regard to the tax proposals in the draft directive, I will do my best to answer them here this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Ministers. I remind hon. Members that these should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There will be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions. I have the discretion to extend the time available for questions by a maximum of half an hour, if required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles<span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have served under your Chairmanship, Mr. Benton, and I am sure that I will enjoy the experience.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Paymaster General a simple question so that we can get an idea of the effects of the proposed directive. By how much per litre would the price of biodiesel have to drop were the Commission's proposals to become mandatory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I do not have the figures for the drop that would occur if the Commission's proposals requiring us to link biodiesel duty to our overall duty rate for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
conventional diesel were implemented. However, that option is not as good as the derogation that we are applying for, which was announced in the Budget. Such linking would also prevent us from making proper assessments of all the fuels in relation to each other in terms of their environmental impact. While we entirely agree that a minimum rate is necessary, putting it at 50 per cent. would constrain the UK to the point where we would be unable to make the kind of environmental assessment that the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee have been pushing the Government towards, so such a rate would be less beneficial for us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb<span class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Ministers have said about subsidiarity and the overprescriptive aspects of the proposals. However, I am concerned that progress in this country in adopting environmentally attractive alternative fuels is depressingly slow and slower than in some other European countries. I find it bizarre that the duty differential for liquefied petroleum gas appears to be double that proposed for biodiesel. LPG is a fossil fuel, so why double the differential for a fossil fuel as opposed to biodiesel? The Curry report specifically proposes parity, and the embryonic industry has said that it needs parity if it is to be kickstarted into providing an attractive alternative source of income for farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's question. I know that the subject is of considerable interest to him personally, his constituency and that part of the country. He said that we were depressingly slow in moving towards alternative fuels, but I challenge that. A great deal has been done in the European Union in the past five to six years to improve air quality from transport, mainly through directives and agreements on matters such as improving fuels. We have gone from low-sulphur fuels to no-sulphur fuels that will come in during the next year or so, and our work on improvements to engine technology has been spectacular. If we had said six years ago that the level of clean engines would be what it is today, most people would have said that we were being far too optimistic.<br><br>
We have made great strides on LPG. Three or four years ago, people would have said that the network would never be in place to supply vehicles. We opened the 1,000th filling station about six weeks ago, and I believe that there are 1,100 stations now, so they are opening at a rate of more than one a day. The infrastructure is in place, and we have cleaner fuel.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that matters have not progressed as fast as we should have liked in terms of natural gas. He asked a specific question about LPG, and I shall associate it with natural gas. As he will appreciate, the setting up of the infrastructure was important. It is a chicken and egg situation; one cannot have vehicles running on the fuel until the infrastructure is in place. We realised
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
that there was a considerably greater need to incentivise the infrastructure to provide gas fuels, and felt that the level of duty that we had placed on them reflected the difficulties in taking that technology forward. I am pleased to say that LPG has moved forward, although compressed natural gas has not.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Curry report. In terms of LPG and especially compressed natural gas, the tailpipe emissions are substantially better. Gas has the added advantage of being extremely quiet. It is appropriate for use at unsocial times, especially for heavy goods vehicles in centres of population such as cities. He will know that biofuels do not have that tailpipe advantage. There may be a slight advantage in terms of particulates, and more NOx is probably emitted.<br><br>
We could argue that the CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> needed to produce that fuel was neutral given the level of emissions, but another part of the equation—how the biofuel is produced—complicates matters. Production may require fertiliser, which may cause emissions to take place. As the hon. Gentleman knows from his area, a lot of processing is involved, which may create CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> or other emissions. We have to consider the whole environmental footprint of how a fuel is produced, and use the appropriate incentives.<br><br>
We think that we have got the level right. We shall have to revisit the subject from time to time, probably fairly regularly, just as we have revisited how we help the LPG industry convert vehicles. Improvements to the fuels and the technology in the engines have moved forward rapidly and caught up with some of the cleaner fuels, so we shall have to consider carefully how we provide fiscal incentives.<br><br>
I am sorry that that was a rather long answer, but the hon. Gentleman raised an important strategic point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn<span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure, Mr. Benton, to see you in the Chair once again. You regularly look after this Committee.<br><br>
As I prepared for this morning's sitting, I was pleased to receive from the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs a document entitled "Climate Change Scenarios for the United Kingdom", which anyone who ever doubted the evidence on the effects of climate change should read. I am an east coast Member of Parliament, and I was hit rather hard by the report's prediction for my region. The document states that water level increases that currently take 120 years will take only seven years by 2080, unless we deal with this important issue. We face a global environmental problem. I do not know who the appropriate Minister is, but will one of them tell us what discussions are taking place with potential entrants to the European Union— particularly those from the Baltic, which will, unfortunately, be affected by the same phenomenon as places such as Scarborough and Whitby?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with the tax issues for which directives have been agreed. Negotiations with countries that apply to join the European Union are conducted through the acquis, which contains all the EU's currently applicable directives and gives due regard to those being negotiated. Negotiations on directives that are in force are conducted at the Foreign Affairs Council, not by Finance Ministers. Accession countries that do not already comply with the directives must negotiate the period over which they will become compliant. The relevant provisions are called the tax chapters, which are currently being discussed. Where directives such as that before us are still being discussed, accession countries are made aware of the discussions, but the acquis cannot force on them provisions that do not already apply throughout the EU.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right to suggest that such discussions play an important role in establishing how accession countries can reach the necessary levels. To return to my point about setting the level of duty on biodiesels at 50 per cent. of that for diesel, difficult competition issues could arise across the European Union given that the rates in the accession countries are already much lower than those of any member state. Hon. Members are rightly concerned that we should facilitate tax changes and legislative changes to encourage the development of the associated industries in the United Kingdom. A delicate balance must be struck, and my hon. Friend is right to touch on the issue. I know from the tax directive discussions—I am sure that this is true of other issues—that the negotiating package reflects such concerns. To become a member of the European Union, accession states must comply with current legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the question from my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), I should mention that emissions from biofuels may not be as clean as those from LPG. Presumably, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has been giving research and development support to companies that want to develop the technology to enable them to reduce those emissions, because if the emissions could be cleaned up, biofuels would be the fuel of the future. Perhaps the Minister could say exactly how much the Department has spent in the past few years on research and development in relation to biofuel engines for motor vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two things are happening. First, in relation to the development of novel fuels, we introduced the green fuels challenge, which is in the remit of my hon. Friend the Paymaster General. In that initiative, we have given substantial tax and other incentives to develop some of those novel ideas, and we are assisting some interesting projects.<br><br>
Secondly, the Department has carried out a certain amount of research, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the companies involved, such as oil companies and car manufacturers, are highly profitable. The democratic Governments of Europe
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
have set out the standards that we want for the people of Europe, and we have a view about the standards that are required in the United Kingdom. We have set the standard, but most of the research has been done by the oil companies and motor manufacturers, and they have done it very well. They complain when we introduce such ideas and often argue that things cannot be done, but it is pleasing to see that we have surpassed our expectations in terms of technology and oil production. Our job is setting the targets and the standards, and it is very much up to the industry to develop cleaner fuels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The research and development tax credits for both large and small companies would provide—I was going to say "the vehicle", but I saw it coming—the mechanism for an additional form of support and would complement the green fuels challenge objectives and the points made by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'> (Norwich, North): Can the Under-Secretary give an estimate of job creation, both in Europe and in the United Kingdom, or tell us whether he has commissioned any work on that? Furthermore, if jobs are created, will they be in rural, urban or suburban areas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. The simple answer is we do not know, and it is difficult to assess. If the targets directive were introduced, it would have a different impact on different countries in the European Union. We can see why some of the southern states are keener on the directive than northern states as they have a greater capacity than northern states for growing the crops, but it is difficult to assess how much of the crop would develop in the United Kingdom, thereby creating jobs. Market forces would come into play, and if the fiscal incentives were uniformly spread across the European Union, it would probably be difficult for the UK to produce sufficient biofuels to meet the targets. Of course, there would be a strong environmental argument about the development of a monoculture, and about us having fields covered in rapeseed or beet. In addition, land costs are much greater here than in some southern and central European states, so there are many variables within the equation.<br><br>
If the two directives went through, we would be obliged to provide a substantial amount of the biofuel that would be used in the United Kingdom but we could not produce it all. We would have to import it from other member states—or, more probably, from other parts of the world. In the latter case, those fuels may be produced in an unclean way, and the environmental benefit could be entirely lost. The widespread production of biofuels in this country would create very welcome jobs in rural areas. Some of the processing could be done in rural areas or in urban and city areas, but that would depend largely on where the industry wanted to do the processing.</span></p>

would help create jobs, and that 75,000 jobs would created Europe-wide. It is important that we compete properly, and that we are not left behind, as sometimes we are, on agricultural production.<br><br>
The NFU is concerned that the two years' grace on meeting the targets could be extended. Can the Under-Secretary reassure me that that will not be the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises the important point of job creation. We are minded of the potential to create jobs, which is why we are generally supportive of biodiesel. It is one way to reduce the amount of carbon produced by transport, but plenty of other ways need to be incentivised. I shall answer the final point raised by my hon. Friend in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question follows that asked by the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean). The Under-Secretary will be aware of certain problems with the viscosity of biofuels—for instance, they can damage engines. We are not talking only about plant life being used to make them. Biofuels can be produced from rendered cattle, chicken manure and various other things. However, I am surprised that we do not have a UK or European standard on biofuels, and I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would give his considered opinion on that. We have a standard for diesel, but not for biodiesel. Given the various components that can be used to make biodiesel, will he tell us of his thinking on when we are likely to have such a standard?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman means by a standard. I take it that he means an indicative figure of how much should be produced and used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mean a standard on the component parts. It is not a question of the quality of the fuel and what it should contain, but also—the Paymaster General may be interested in this—of taxation. It is a question of whether the fuel should conform to a quality, and what it might be, given that it can be made from various things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. We are now consulting on a fiscal standard based on the international fuel quality standard. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that there are different ways of producing biofuels. It may be more appropriate for us to use cooking oils and fats rather than producing them from farmed material, because as much as 100,000 tonnes of that is produced a year and it can be recycled. I assure him that we are consulting on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the seriousness with which the Under-Secretary responded to my question, but could I press him further on the disparity in duty reduction compared with that for LPG?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
The Government clearly accept that there is a strong case for promoting biodiesel, or they would not have introduced the 20p reduction in duty. In an earlier answer, he accepted that the Government regard biodiesel as one as a range of alternative fuels with potential for use. However, people representing that embryonic industry tell me that they need a bigger duty reduction to kickstart the industry and get production under way. Given that many of the crops are already being grown in this country, using the pesticides to which the Under-Secretary referred, and given that the Government accept that biodiesel is one of the answers for the future, should there not be a bigger duty reduction to kickstart the industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a quick answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, as it links in with the previous question about definition.<br><br>
The balance that we must strike relates to the need to ensure that all environmental concerns in the production of the fuel as well as the fuel itself are taken into consideration, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said. Secondly, if the subsidy—for want of a better word—is excessive vis-á-vis production, it would fall within state aid rules and be considered unfair competition, which would cause problems in terms of specific assistance.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, the Government are approaching the green fuel challenge by adopting specific projects that will enable us to see more clearly the viability of the fuel. The second round for applications was announced by the Financial Secretary, so that we might make progress in that regard.<br><br>
The two Departments seek to do slightly different but complementary things. We must work under strict rules for the purposes of tax, whether we are dealing with a reduction in duty, capital allowances or research and development. We must also have definitions for operating that make it possible sensibly to apply the assessments of the fuels without huge burdens. That is a slightly different test to the quality test for a fuel for wider purposes.<br><br>
The Government are balancing several issues within the complete perspective, which includes environment and climate change, and are seeking to make progress. I understand the hon. Gentleman's frustrations, which I share, but we can progress in a logical way that does not cause problems within the framework of other rules or lead to a challenge by those who feel that we are creating unfair competition. Other fuel producers might challenge us on that issue.<br><br>
The interaction of tax and standards is complicated, but we are achieving the right balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the opening remarks of the Under-Secretary on road haulage, which is an important industry. What contact has his Department made, not only with the road haulage industry but with the important public transport
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
sector, particularly the bus operators and the manufacturers of their vehicles?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. We have regular discussions with the road haulage and bus industries, because these matters impact on them. We are trying to incentivise them to do a number of things, including making better and cleaner use of existing vehicles. The modernisation fund was for particulate traps, and to encourage better use of vehicles. We have had a lot of discussions about ensuring that vehicles travel on routes where they are more efficient as well as about the content of their fuel. A great deal is going on because they are important contributors.<br><br>
We cannot escape the fact that we are setting down the standards for fuels—we are aiming for a lower carbon future. With regard to the directives, we are trying to avoid the overprescriptive model that could inhibit the indicative targets that we should prefer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that there are Ministers here from two Departments. However, there should really be a third, from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, because the source of most biofuels is agricultural land. I take the Minister's point that if large amounts of fertiliser are used to grow a crop, the environmental advantages might well be outweighed by the disadvantages. What discussions have taken place with DEFRA about the fact that, as subsidies move from direct production to more agrienvironmental land management, non-fertiliser-promoted biofuels would be an area to which such subsidies could be directed? I hope that the Ministers will be able to fill us in on their discussions with DEFRA on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to wish a third Minister into this debate. Having two is one thing; three would be another. We are in close communication with DEFRA and with the Department of Trade and Industry—we could have had a fourth Minister here—and the "Powering Future Vehicles" document was a joint enterprise between our Departments. Although each Department has its priorities, we co-operate closely on these matters. We have, possibly for the first time, a joined-up approach to the issues, and a high degree of agreement on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the matter of LPG. It introduces some interesting points, which I shall raise later. The Under-Secretary rightly talked about various incentives that are available. As I have written to him and tabled several parliamentary questions on the matter, he will know that my concern is the LPG restriction on vehicles going through the channel tunnel. On several occasions, his predecessors have said that they are actively pursuing the matter. If there is one block to further development of LPG, it is not allowing LPG cars through the tunnel. I can think of no reason why that should be; it restricts vehicles from continental Europe, where there is ample supply of LPG, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
will send out a signal that LPG is an unstable fuel, and that is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we go too far down that path and through the tunnel with the hon. Gentleman, you will probably call us to order, Mr. Benton, but the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I accept that the signal given out by the fact that LPG cars are not allowed to use the tunnel is not a healthy one for promoting that part of the industry. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are making the appropriate moves to see what can be done to make the appropriate changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Under-Secretary a little further on his previous answer to me? I fully understand that in seeking to improve environmental policy we must also ensure that we stick to the tax rules imposed from Europe. However, as I understand it, Germany and Austria have a nil tax rate on biodiesel and France has a variable arrangement, but they have still made significant increased reductions compared with the UK. If it is possible for those countries to achieve that, and for Germany to achieve a substantial level of crop production for biodiesel along the way, why cannot we do that within the same regulatory framework?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Under-Secretary had already answered that question, so I will try to put the information in a slightly different way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a Treasury way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not be tempted down that route.<br><br>
The Government recognise that the production of biodiesel can provide useful greenhouse gas emission savings relative to mineral diesels, but that cannot be done at any cost. The contributory factors that need to be taken into account in considering the manufacturing of what I shall call for want of a better word alternative fuels, have been cited by my hon. Friend: water quality requirements, biodiversity, land prices, opportunity and the cost of producing that fuel vis-á-vis the gain. Therefore, it is impossible to make a direct comparison with every other member country. For example, land values vary considerably. The Government's climate change programme emphasises the need to consider cost-effective measures and to ensure that the cost is not disproportionate. That must be done if we are to develop a truly competitive industry. In fact, the environmental statement published by the Treasury in 1997—I think that was part of our first Budget—sets out those principles, which are exactly the principles expanded on by my hon. Friend this morning.<br><br>
It is tempting to try to compare things that are not similar, and to claim that they are similar and would have a similar outcome, but, unfortunately, that is not possible in this case. However, the hon. Gentleman's point is well taken by the Committee and the Government. We must make progress with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
the work that we are doing to ensure the cost-effective development of those fuels and their speedy introduction. That is being done in the pilot projects that are being conducted as part of the green fuels challenge.<br><br>
We must consider other demands. I was up early enough this morning to hear "Farming Today", although I do not usually listen to that programme. There was an interesting discussion about energy production and willow power stations. The programme said that the latest station had been confirmed and is to be built. That raised the question of the ability to grow enough willow near to the power station to ensure that it does not have to be transported across the country, defeating the aim of such power stations. We should not view the capacities that the hon. Gentleman rightly focuses on simply in narrow terms of fuel—although that is very important—but in terms of the whole Government strategy on energy use. We should consider how we can balance them. That is what we are seeking to do, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will continue to push us on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lawrie Quinn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear such a well-argued expose of sustainability made from the Treasury Bench. In my previous life, before entering the House, I worked as a civil engineer in the railway industry. One blight on my job was working in and around railway marshalling yards, where there was much contamination caused by diesel used by smelly, leaky locomotives. The communication, to use the Under-Secretary's term, under paragraph 5.42 contains an interesting section concerning groundwater contamination through the use of biofuel technology. Will he confirm whether any further work has been done on the necessary risk assessment, particularly in relation to the storage facilities for such fuels, and say how that would apply to current regulations for transport undertakers such as the railway industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as always, makes a significant point. Some work has been done on the potential leakage of such fuels into watercourses and the potential extra risk that they might pose. I am happy to drop him a line, setting out some of the information that I do not have at my fingertips. He raises an important subsidiary aspect.<br><br>
Also, in terms of railway engines, biodiesel would probably not give much advantage at the point of use. That is often the complaint in railway stations and marshalling yards, where there is considerable pollution at the point of use. Unfortunately, biofuels do not bring much comfort on that score, but engine technology does. Such technology has moved on hugely in recent years and, as new rolling stock is introduced, some of the problems that my hon. Friend refers to will be substantially reduced. I shall jot him a line about our knowledge of and information on the potential leakage of biofuels into the water table.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be a little slow this morning, but I am baffled by the Paymaster General's two attempts to answer the questions of my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk. I would like to tease out two areas. The Paymaster General said that the possible reduction in fuel duty for biofuels could be regarded as breaking the state aid rules. I am completely confused by that. In what other areas would a reduction in tax be seen as breaking those rules?<br><br>
Secondly, the Paymaster General seems to be implying that because the cost of production in the UK might differ from that in Germany, perhaps due to land values in this country, we should have a different fuel duty rate. I did not know that fuel duty rates were related to the cost of production; I thought that that was a matter of competitiveness between companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, deary me. I do not think that now is the time for a lesson in economics and competition. The state aid rules cover circumstances in which a country is seen to provide a company with an unfair subsidy on the production of anything, to give it an advantageous market position. That may be direct grant or forgoing tax. The rules have been in place since the EU was formed, when it was called the Common Market, and they involve competition across member states. We required state aid clearance before we could introduce the climate change levy and some exceptions to it, and there are many other examples.<br><br>
The reason for that is that if competition is to operate it must do so fairly, and the Commission takes a strict line on what it considers to be overcompensation. The hon. Members for North Norfolk and for Ludlow (Matthew Green) argue that the Government should pay direct subsidy to the production of certain fuels, by grant or tax relief, and that, to establish that such support is proportionate, they should demonstrate that the costs are not greater than the benefits of the development. Such straight cost-benefit analysis is simple, and that is how member states should operate.<br><br>
However, the hon. Member for Ludlow could have gone on to say that the 15 economies all work in slightly different ways, which is true. The UK financial industry does much better than that of any other member state, for many and varied reasons, and huge rule changes and a great deal of movement would be required to enable another member state to develop a financial industry on a par with ours. There are other examples, such as member states choosing to raise their taxes in different ways, given what their populations are prepared to pay tax on.<br><br>
So, the hon. Gentleman suggests that there is a level playing field across Europe, but there is not. Although he argues for something that he claims is environmentally friendly, by focusing on the one issue he seeks to side step, adding to the equation the question whether our investment in developing environmentally friendly options is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
disproportionately great. That would mean that the costs to the environment were greater elsewhere.<br><br>
The Government have to consider how fuels for vehicles, energy production and our approach to biodiversity, air quality and water quality fit together at every point. We must ensure that we produce cost-effective and sustainable alternatives, because sustainability is supposed to be the foundation of any benefit to the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Francois<span class='memberconstituency'>(Rayleigh)</span>
</span> <span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Paymaster General's remarks about the European Commission's power to affect our taxation on competition grounds. So that there is complete clarity, will she reiterate that it could have power over levels of taxation in our country under existing statutes? The Government frequently argue that Europe will not be able to interfere in our taxation, so the question has implications for other matters, not least the single currency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely tempted to go way outside today's debate, but I merely remind the hon. Gentleman that his party made the commitment to the single market and a Conservative Government signed up to the treaty obligations of which the state aid provisions are part. The state aid provisions are intended to buttress and help pave the way for the efficient operation of the single market, which his party championed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allotted for questions.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 15500/01, Commission Communication and two draft Directives on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport, and provision for Member States to apply differentiated rates of excise duty in favour of biofuels; considers that the objectives of security of supply and climate change abatement can best be achieved by an approach which promotes renewable transport fuels as a whole, and reflects the individual circumstances of Member States and EU renewable energy policy through the setting of indicative, flexible targets; welcomes the principles of making it easier for Member States to set a lower rate of duty on cleaner fuels such as biofuels; but considers that the detail of the Commission's approach (in particular, the links with current duty rates for conventional fuels and with oil prices) should be questioned.—[<i>Mr. Jamieson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it was the hon. Member for Ludlow who said that perhaps three, five, six, seven or even eight Ministers should be present today. That would have been nice, although I am pleased that we have two Ministers here to debate such an important subject. It may surprise you, Mr. Benton, because I know that you take an interest in these matters, but my experience on the European Scrutiny Committee is that some debates are less interesting than others. It could be my age, but I have quite enjoyed today's. I thank the Ministers for their courteous, straightforward and helpful answers. If they did not know an answer, they made it clear, which is pretty refreshing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
It all comes down to cost. The Under-Secretary—or perhaps the Paymaster General—said the Budget provides a 20 per cent. reduction per litre for biofuels. I remember listening to that announcement and thinking that it was quite good, but I did not hear the words "or proportion thereof. As the Under-Secretary rightly says, nothing can run on poor biodiesel, and it is dangerous even to contemplate mixing more than about 5 per cent. into the fuel. A 20 per cent. reduction is one of 20p for every £1, but if only 5 per cent. of biodiesel is used, the reduction is only 1p. That was admitted—again, I am grateful for that—but the cost of producing a litre of biodiesel is roughly twice that of producing fossil diesel. The difference in cost is 2p per litre, so a standard litre of biodiesel now costs 1p more than fossil fuel.<br><br>
The debate on LPG was interesting. The Liberal Democrats suggest that it is undesirable because it is a fossil fuel, and that we should therefore consider increasing the rate charged for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be keen as mustard to give way when I have developed the point.<br><br>
If we decide to increase LPG duty, we shall kill biodiesel in its tracks. The Under-Secretary rightly says that we must provide incentives to create an infrastructure and change the way in which engines are developed. Several fleets have made big investments in LPG, and if we say that we are going to tax them pretty damn hard, we shall be sending the wrong message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green</span> <i>rose</i>— </p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman—who will, I suspect, tell me that that was not what the Liberal Democrats said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Matthew Green</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely not what was said, or implied. We are pushing for duty on biofuels to be reduced to the level of that on LPG, not for duty on LPG to go back up to the level of the duty on biofuels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats will have to be a lot clearer in future. I am a very suspicious type, and all their sneering comments about fossil fuels made me think that they wanted to increase LPG duty. However, they have now made an interesting point.<br><br>
The Paymaster General must have won the Golden Rose award for her convoluted argument on state subsidy. As answers go, it was a model of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a good Treasury answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed—and the hon. Lady is a good Treasury Minister. However, her argument on accession was convoluted. I agree that we face competition from the continent over fuel prices, but it is from the near continent. I think that Poland is the nearest country seeking accession, but the marginal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
cost of using Polish fuel in this country does not exist, even given Polish levels of excise duty.<br><br>
I asked the hon. Lady when she thought the regulations would be introduced and when the changes would take place, but she said that she could not be precise. However, I—with the aid of Conservative central office—have done some arithmetic. The average tax rate for biodiesel is 54p in continental Europe and 49p in this country, even given the changes. Enforcing the measures suggested by the Commission would mean changes of 30p or more, so I am not surprised that the hon. Lady does not want them introduced.<br><br>
Given that biodiesels can be made from various and variable ingredients, we need a fuel standard for taxation purposes and to ensure quality at the pub— [<i>Laughter.</i>] I beg your pardon, Mr. Benton. I meant at the pump.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Gibson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Keep going.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that things are so bad that pubs are selling our petrol.<br><br>
Motorists and hauliers need an assurance that filling up with biodiesel will not put their engines at risk. It is interesting that, even with a 5 per cent. mix of diesel, some fuel injectors will still be at risk. The Under-Secretary made a telling point about the move to 5.75 per cent., which is heck of a difference from 5 per cent. That means that we will have to ensure that the amount that is biodiesel is of an assured quality.<br><br>
Even though biofuels are twice as expensive to produce as fossil fuels, it is important that we use more of them, to reduce dependency on oil from unstable parts of the world. I am slightly at variance with the two Ministers, because I think that that is important. After all, 13 per cent. of our farmland, 800,000 hectares, is now set-aside. That can properly be used for the production of biofuels. I have mentioned the importance of standards, and I am aware that we often consider the United States to be negligent in its conservation of oil resources. However, I have here a document from the US Office of Transportation Technologies, dated March 2001, and I am surprised to see that the US already blends 10 per cent. of its gasoline with biofuels, principally ethanol from crops, and has been able to exceed the European Union targets because it took the decision to put fuel standards before anything else.<br><br>
The United Kingdom has the lowest level of consumption in the European Union—less than 0.3 per cent. Austria is the highest with 5 per cent. However, people are not necessarily looking towards subsidies. Change will only be achieved if there is a substantial tax break. The arguments about the environment, LPG and various alternatives meant nothing until we had a serious look at the level of duty—so long as that on biodiesel is roughly at parity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
with that on fossil diesel, change is not going to be made.<br><br>
Because the production of biodiesel is so labour-intensive, we have an opportunity to revive some of our rural areas. However, I have a number of worries. First, I do not believe that the two-year targets are realistic. If we do not seek some changes and aim for greater flexibility, we shall put the country at risk of considerable fluctuations in market prices and a check on imports. It would take only one bad harvest for things to get out of kilter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about price fluctuations. Is that not already our experience with crude oil? This country, like the whole of the developed world, has been under enormous pressure because of the power of the middle east, in particular, to change the price of oil, which causes all sorts of problems for the economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not fundamentally disagree with that point, but we need a degree of realism. There has been fluctuation in the oil price, but it remains relatively low compared with that of a few years ago. We are working towards two-year targets. If we were to extend the period to, say, six years—or four years, or seven years—we might have a better chance of creating the infrastructure and making the changes necessary to ensure that we could meet the targets by a natural process, which I think is what the Ministers were suggesting. However, if we try to reach the targets within two years from such a low base, we shall be dependent on substantial imports. One bad harvest in that two-year period could make it very difficult.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary will be aware that there was some discussion in the press about his views on hydrogen cars. I refer specifically to an article that appeared in <i>The Times</i> on 22 April, in which he seems to have got himself embroiled in an argument about the viability of such cars. That seems at variance with what he said in his speech about the need not to plump early for a particular amount. I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary were to say how important he thinks hydrogen cars are likely to be. I understand that by 2025 we should have 22 per cent. availability in terms of meeting our energy needs through hydrogen. Why does he seem to be closing off the option so early?<br><br>
Finally, we have sympathy with what the Government say about seeking greater flexibility, and not closing our options off too early with regard to hydrogen cars—but ultimately the issue comes down to taxation. Without some kind of incentive to use biofuels, they will be unobtainable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Norman Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by talking about the two prime drivers, as the Under-Secretary described them, for the proposals—security of energy supply and the reduction of the environmental impact of fuel used in transport. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) referred to the United

States, which is now making a considerable commitment to increasing energy crops for the production of biodiesel and other fuels. It is doing so not out of any great commitment to the environment—we have yet to notice that from President Bush—but from a recognition of the importance of improving security of energy supply and reducing reliance on the middle east's crude oil. We must remember that those are both key objectives in the development of policy in the UK and across Europe.<br><br>
In response to my first question, the Under-Secretary rightly drew attention to the considerable progress that has been made in improving existing uses of fossil fuels. Vehicles are much cleaner than they used to be and that has produced considerable dividends in moving towards Kyoto targets. However there has been slow progress in the replacement of fossil fuels to any degree with other sources of fuel. The Government accept in principle the case for a mix of different fuels. Indeed, not only has the duty on LPG—a fossil fuel—been reduced, but a 20p differential for biodiesel has been introduced.<br><br>
However, a much greater reduction in duty is necessary to kick-start this embryonic industry. I listened carefully to the points made by the Treasury Minister about ensuring that we complied with tax rules. I am unsure whether I fully understood why it is possible for Germany and Austria to apply a nil tax rate but not possible for us to do likewise, or simply to reduce the rate to the same level as that for LPG.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary invited me to continue pressing the Government to achieve further reductions. I will meet that challenge, and continue to present the case. Everything that I have heard from those involved in agriculture and those trying to get this industry going tells me that there needs to be a bigger duty reduction before the industry can begin to succeed. Unless we grasp that nettle, we shall continue with a desperately low level of biodiesel as a percentage of the overall fuel mix.<br><br>
A lot of store has been set by the Curry report, which specifically recommends to Government that there should be parity in duty between biodiesel and LPG—a clean fossil fuel, if I may so describe it. There is massive potential for the development of biofuels, as we have 800,000 hectares of set-aside in this country, which is 13 per cent. of our farmland. On the basis of best practice in Germany, two tonnes of biodiesel oil could be produced per hectare. Merely by using its set-aside land, this country could produce more than 1 million tonnes of biodiesel oil, which could make a substantial contribution to achieving the targets in the proposals.<br><br>
The agricultural sector has suffered years of falling incomes and faces an uncertain future. There is pressure from the WTO, which will only increase, to reduce the subsidy on production in agriculture, affecting crops such as sugar beet. Farmers face an even more uncertain future than under the existing regime, and a potential new source of income for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
arable farmers is an attractive idea. In Norfolk especially, as it is an arable county, such a crop could make a real difference.<br><br>
I am grateful that the Under-Secretary has agreed to meet my constituents and me to discuss the issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow made the point that a Minister from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs should be present at today's Committee. I am delighted to say that a Minister from that Department has agreed to come to the same meeting as the Under-Secretary. I hope that some joined-up thinking will develop as a result of that meeting, and from other discussions between Departments.<br><br>
I note the Minister's concerns about protecting biodiversity and the need to consider the entire energy environmental picture, including the impact of growing the crops. However, the agricultural community has come a long way in cleaning up its act and reducing reliance on pesticides and herbicides. With the technology available, they can much better focus the use of those products in producing crops. There has been progress not only in the use of fossil fuels but in cleaning up agriculture. The Government have given the green light, in that they have produced the 20p differential in duty, but more help is needed to make progress.<br><br>
As the Commission says in its proposals, there is strong growth in transportation oil production. If we are to achieve the Kyoto targets and improve security of energy supplies, we need action rather than a continued debate about what might be the best approach. There needs to be progress now. I recognise that considerable criticism has been voiced throughout the European Union about the proposals, and that some changes to them will inevitably be made. It is important that what emerges at the end of that process is not watered down waffle, but tough targets that will achieve the Kyoto commitments and—as a priority—reduce Europe's reliance on crude oil from the middle east.</span></p>
<p>11.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful, well informed and helpful debate, and I am grateful to hon. Members for their questions and speeches. We were treated to a little arithmetic by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar when he realised that the 20p in the pound reduction on 5 per cent. biodiesel in fuel actually means 1p per litre, and I congratulate him on getting it right. That 1p reduction probably reflects the average 1p extra cost of producing biodiesel fuel. The cost at the pump is therefore no different from conventional fuel, but the incentive is biased towards to the production of the biodiesel.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about safeguards on the quality of biofuel. Blended fuels need to meet the same standards as mineral diesel, and a number of other quality parameters. He also asked about engines. He was right to say that many of the engines being produced now would seize up if they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
used a high biodiesel blend, or if they used it neat. I believe that the ends of the injectors would blow off and all sorts of other things could happen. However, the manufacturers provide a warranty for their vehicles up to a 5 per cent. blend of biodiesel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the Under-Secretary is right about the 5 per cent., but the documents before us envisage a blend of 5.75 per cent. I have talked to a number of people in the industry, and they are of the opinion that an attempt is being made to achieve a standard on the biodiesel element of the blend. Are they correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No legislation exists to define requirements for the quality of biofuels, but the oil industry has produced a draft industry standard. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that we have reservations about the second proposal that we are considering today, which is for a 5.75 per cent. blend by 2010. Manufacturers will, of course, have time to respond, but with present technology that would present some challenges.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that we should not give subsidies but we should give tax breaks. Tax breaks are probably the same as subsidies—but my hon. Friend the Paymaster General might be more proficient in answering that point. However, we are providing fiscal incentives in order to move away from conventional polluting fuels to less polluting and more environmentally friendly fuels. If he reflects on that, he will see a clear if subtle difference.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman touched on the security of supply, and spoke of our meeting some of the targets. He rightly pointed out that our weather is variable, as it is in most of northern and central Europe. A bad harvest could lead to countries having to import vast amounts of biofuels—probably from countries outside the EU. If that happened, the market could dictate whether those fuels were produced in an environmentally friendly way. In fact we could find ourselves forced to use fuel produced in a less environmentally way than we had intended.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a scurrilous attack on me about hydrogen—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would hardly call it scurrilous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was wounding. He seemed to imply that we had closed off our ambition regarding hydrogen. That is not the case.<br><br>
There may be a profound difference between the thinking in this country and that in other European countries and parts of the scientific and manufacturing community. Our objective is to reduce carbon produced by transport. We do not see our job as trying to second-guess what will replace current fuels. That will develop with technology. Even in the past five years, technology has developed in ways that we, and perhaps the industry, did not expect. We want some such technologies developed.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
For example, we have seen hydrogen vehicles that use conventional and often efficient engines in conjunction with electric motors and electricity storage. In the interim of our journey towards cleaner output from transport, we see such vehicles as an important contributor.<br><br>
In years to come, hydrogen may eventually replace fuels as we know them in transport. However, there is a long journey to make and many bridges to cross before then. If there is to be widespread hydrogen use, hydrogen will have to be produced in an environmentally friendly way. At the moment, it is largely produced by electrolysis, which requires electricity produced by conventional means. The point at which all that happens may be beyond the scope of our lives—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, speak for yourself—I am going to live a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such developments may be within the scope of my hon. Friend's life if she lives as long as the late Queen Mother, but the time scale is certainly long. We would have to reach a point at which electricity was produced by environmentally friendly means and then produced hydrogen. We are not opposed to hydrogen.<br><br>
The newspaper article to which the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred was about BMW, the internal combustion engine and the use of hydrogen. We do not say whether that approach, which uses cryogenic storage of gases, is right or wrong. It causes difficulties, because there is 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. leakage of the fuel a week. The equation has many complicated variables with which we have to wrestle.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk made a considered contribution and mentioned the security of supply. I take his point, and he made some good comments about the impact of transport fuels on the environment. He said that there had been slow progress in the replacement of fossil fuels. We in government see the process very much as a journey towards a low-carbon future. We have not said that we will plump for one method of achieving it as opposed to another. A variety of routes will probably give us some success, and biodiesel will have a part to play.<br><br>
We do not think that the Commission's approach on the targets directive—to set targets in the assumption that one size will fit all 15 countries—is appropriate. Individual countries should have much more say in how they achieve what we consider indicative amounts. They should find their own way to meet targets.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Curry report, which I covered fairly fully in my original remarks. We have to consider the whole footprint of the production of biodiesel when providing any fiscal incentive. There are enormous variables, and we must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
consider the environmental impact of all the set-aside that he talked about. If it were all used for the production of biodiesels, we would have to think carefully about production methods and their impact on the general ecology and aesthetic appearance of the countryside. A raft of issues would be important.<br><br>
Perhaps it is because the hon. Gentleman comes from a rural community that he talks a lot about subsidy. We are providing incentives, and in many cases it is now up to the industry to respond to them and use the market to push forward the products that it thinks will be advantageous.<br><br>
The debate has been helpful and useful. It seems that although there is not unanimity on all the issues, there is wide agreement on many of them, especially those contained in the communication, and on where we are aiming for a more carbon-free transport future. There will be differences within the Committee about how we might achieve that future, with some emphasising certain fuels and methods and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
others emphasising others. Notwithstanding that, I hope that the Committee will agree to the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 15500/01, Commission Communication and two draft Directives on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport, and provision for Member States to apply differentiated rates of excise duty in favour of biofuels; considers that the objectives of security of supply and climate change abatement can best be achieved by an approach which promotes renewable transport fuels as a whole, and reflects the individual circumstances of Member States and EU renewable energy policy through the setting of indicative, flexible targets; welcomes the principles of making it easier for Member States to set a lower rate of duty on cleaner fuels such as biofuels; but considers that the detail of the Commission's approach (in particular, the links with current duty rates for conventional fuels and with oil prices) should be questioned.</p></blockquote></p>
