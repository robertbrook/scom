</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument here is much the same as my argument on amendments to clause 2. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure a debate in the House should the Minister wish to extend the exemptions under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued long and hard about the exemption of Lloyd's and other bodies. Exemption from the Bill is a privilege not lightly to be conferred. We shall have wasted valuable time if exemptions can be given without maximum safeguards. The negative procedure is inadequate because it can be used to prevent the House from debating the issues fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister wish to allow exemption on the negative procedure? It may be an adequate procedure for making a further exemption of a purely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
technical nature, such as those granted under clause 42, but how does he know that some future Administration would not misuse the power to add exemptions on a broader scale? What kinds of exemptions does the Minister have in mind? Can the clause be tightened up so that such exemptions granted under the negative procedure are of a purely technical nature? This is a matter of principle. We cannot allow the granting of exemptions to the Bill without the proper, full parliamentary procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In legislation in which exemptions are delineated in one clause, there is normally another clause dealing with the removal of exemptions. We have incorporated within the Bill a constitutional safeguard which will allow the Government of the day to choose different options to suit different circumstances. If we had not included clause 42 we might have prejudged some fundamental issues, but, in addition, we must take into account some of the technical matters hinted at by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said when the hon. Member for Yeovil proposed a similar amendment to clause 2, Parliament should be able to consider any proposals to alter the Bill's scope—in this case, by exempting people from its provisions or removing exemptions conferred under it. Where the effect of an order is to remove an exemption conferred by chapter IV, the Bill's scope will be extended to affect different people. That sort of extension should be made only on a positive decision of Parliament, and the Bill so provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Yeovil rightly inferred from the Bill, different considerations apply in the case of additional exemptions, which may be purely technical. For example, one of the statutes specified in clause 42 could be repealed or amended so that someone other than the person specified in clause 42 could carry out the statutory functions described. In such a case—as I am sure the hon. Member for Yeovil would agree—the affirmative resolution procedure would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a proposed exemption seriously affected the rights of investors, the order could be considered by Parliament, and, if Parliament disagreed with it, annulled. However, such consideration would not be necessary or desirable in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil made a good libertarian, as opposed to Liberal, point when he said that a future Administration—he may mean the current one because it will be the future Administration—might take advantage of the powers given in clause 43. Under the negative resolution procedure it is easy for the Opposition to pray against the order in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43 gives the House the opportunity to decide what is and what is not important, and to use its procedures to execute its traditional constitutional duties. To an extent, the debate that we are having must take place in many Standing Committees, but, having examined the issue as the hon. Member for Yeovil would wish the Government to examine it, I feel that the constitutional safeguards that he values are maintained. However, the clause allows us to avoid wasting the House's time by having to use the mandatory affirmative resolution procedure on a purely technical detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in the earlier debate on clause 2, I have sympathy for what the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is trying to do, and for the underlying point that he made. The Government seem to make a distinction between the provisions affecting those carrying out investment business—which they see as a matter for an affirmative resolution of the House—and provisions affecting investors. They consider the latter less important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting speaks volumes for the Government's attitude towards such matters. It is not worth pressing the matter to a Division, but the provision gives an interesting insight into the Government's priorities on the subject. They consider the Bill with a view to protecting those carrying on investment business rather than protecting investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the Minister's view that the negative resolution procedure is effective. He knows that in practice it is not. A statutory instrument may be referred to Committee, and the Committee can vote against the motion. Nothing more can be done. It is therefore a matter of principle. It is wrong to use the negative resolution procedure on something as fundamental as bringing more people into the privileged position of being exempt under the Bill, although I recognise the Minister's reasons—as well as the technical aspects—for including clause 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that he does not wish to press the matter to a vote. He also said that the clause gives an insight into the Government's attitude. However, more importantly, this is an issue of principle. We should not allow people to be given the privileges of exemption unless the matter has passed with assurance before the House of Commons. Therefore, I shall press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND PRACTICES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 231, in page 28, line 20, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 creates criminal offences in relation to misleading statements and practices and is obviously an important part of the armoury designed to deal with wrongdoers. It has been suggested to me that clause 44(2) goes too far because the offence committed would be one of strict liability. Under clause 44(1) a person has to know that the statement he is making is misleading, or had to make such a statement "recklessly".
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
There is no such test in 44(2). It therefore seems possible that the conduct of a person with honest intentions could still be caught within the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 231 is a probing amendment. I could have tabled an amendment to introduce the concepts of "knowingly" or "recklessly". Those elements should be included because there are normally two parts to any criminal offence: the guilty mind and the guilty act. I am not sure that this subsection incorporates the former.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly on the amendment because I too have heard about the misgivings of City institutions about the liabilities that might arise under this subsection and I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. It has been put to me that the wording of subsection (2), in relation to a "misleading impression" about the market being given, worries some dealers and brokers who, in discharging a contract or an order on behalf of a client, may have to go into the market and acquire parcels of shares at different prices. In some circumstances, they may have to sell some shares in order to make a market in which they will later be buyers, or, vice versa, they may wish to buy some shares before they sell them. If they are asked questions or disclose facts about either of those initial moves—which are, in a sense, moves to make a market to discharge the whole of the contract with the client—technically they will fall foul of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various technical ways in which professionals make markets in the City which may, in the strict sense, give rise to a misleading view of what they are up to and what they believe the market price for a share to be, are and ought to be legitimate means of trading for professionals in the market. They are all big boys, they all know the rules of the game and they would be better left to make a market in their own way rather than falling foul of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general rule, and under other clauses, I am in the vanguard of those who wish to see the fullest standards of disclosure. I favour a high degree of disclosure and the integrity of that disclosure when it comes to prospectuses and giving information, and I shall say so later. What I have said about subsection (2) appears to fly in the face of that, but there is real anxiety that the legitimate, market-making activities of professionals will be wrongly inhibited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I say on behalf of the Opposition that we should be extremely worried if the Minister were to show any sign of accepting the amendment. Subsection (2) is designed to do in relation to conduct what subsection (1) does in relation to statements. The point that was exercising the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is adequately dealt with—indeed, I cannot imagine how it could be better dealt with—by the phrase "for the purpose of which imports a more than adequate element of mens rea. I entirely agree that that ought to be there, and it certainly is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there may be technical arguments underlying what was said by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), but he revealed by his concluding remarks his own unease at advancing them.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
Opposition Members would be worried if any such loophole were created on technical or other grounds because it could be exploited to the disadvantage of the investor and to the disadvantage of all people operating in the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful that in relation to subsection (2) we do not create an impossible and impractical situation in some dealings. The intention of the clause is valid, but I am concerned about its practical implications and also about subsection (4) and the question whether what is done is done exclusively in the United Kingdom. Because of the practical effects of data transmission, the place where the contract is entered into is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. and learned Friend bear in mind those considerations between now and Report, because the question of whether the conduct is engaged in within the United Kingdom may be material in dealing with transactions taking place abroad that are purported to take place in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). We must distinguish between the conduct that is appropriate between one market maker and another, and the conduct that authorised persons should display to their clients. We do not want an authorised person to be able to mislead a client about the value of securities, or the position of a firm. However, we may be able to distinguish between the two categories of transaction through the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because a market maker must, in the nature of his business, mislead other makers. As a client, I should want a market maker acting on my behalf to mislead a person to whom he was going to sell, or from whom he was going to buy, shares on my behalf. That is the only way in which he can achieve the best possible execution for me. As I understand the practices on the floor of the stock exchange, misleading of that sort is part of daily business—and properly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to include in a Bill a clause that can draw that distinction, but it is important that we do not threaten to outlaw behaviour of a sort which is quite proper, while we are trying to ensure that clients are not misled by their advisers or managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to ask my hon. and learned Friend whether he would consider the example of a stockbroker who has an institutional client, perhaps a pension fund, which wishes to sell 500,000 shares, and who agrees a strategy with the client to sell 50,000 shares a week for the next 10 weeks. The stockbroker is then asked by someone else in the market whether he has any more shares to sell, and says, "No, these are all that I am selling"— meaning in that week. Is that stockbroker making a misleading statement that would be a criminal offence under clause 44(2)? If so, profound changes will have to take place in the way that the market operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was supplied by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). The words "for the purpose of in clause 44(2) show quite clearly the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
degree of intention necessary before the offence created by the subsection can be committed; that meets my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Others of my hon. Friends have suggested that there may be circumstances which should give rise to exemptions from the effect of clause 44(2). Clause 45(7) provides that nothing done in conformity with rules made under clause 45(2)	<i>(i)</i> in relation to the stablisation of the price of international securities, before or during a specified period following the issuing of those securities, will be regarded as a contravention of the offence in clause 44 (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, nothing done in conformity with rules concerning Chinese walls made under clause 	<i>45(2)(h)</i> will be regarded as a contravention of clause 44(1) and (2). The rules to be made under paragraphs 	<i>45(2)(h)</i> and 	<i>(i)</i> are clearly vital. The answer to the anxiety expressed by my hon. Friends is to be found in the rules, as was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those routes towards exemption from the effects of clause 44(2) may not be regarded as sufficient, and we have made it clear that if further examples can be identified that ought properly to provide exemption from clause 44(2), we shall be prepared to look at them, but so far no one has identified an exemption that we are satisfied should qualify for such treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Stafford (Mr. Cash) and for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) raised specific points. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford was concerned with the territorial scope of the events relating to misleading statements. It is in line with what the House of Lords held in the case of R. v. Markus [1976] A.C. 35, a decision that must be well known to my hon. Friend, and which turned upon the existing provisions in the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West postulated related to misleading statements and not to misleading actions, so it would come within the scope of subsection (1) and not of subsection (2). Clause 44(1) does no more than re-enact the existing provisions of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act. Whether the statement to which my hon. Friend referred would be regarded as misleading would depend on whether the court felt that it could properly be implied that the answer referred only to the week in question or whether, given all the surrounding circumstances, it went wider than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My purpose in raising the matter was that we are legislating to cover the decision to which my hon. and learned Friend has referred, which illustrates the way that the provisions of that Act were interpreted. I merely wanted to point out that there may be a practical point that could be considered. I shall leave it at that for the time being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for his remarks. If I understood him correctly, he said that he intended to look at the matter again, either in the context of clause 44 or clause 45, to ensure that anything done by a recognised market maker in good faith in the course of his business is allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
I was rather worried about what my hon. and learned Friend said when I cursorily glanced ahead to clause 45. That concerns the conduct of business rules for authorised businesses and not SROs, so anything done by a firm that is a member of an SRO and is not subject to the conduct of business rules promulgated by the Secretary of State does not necessarily fall under subsection (2)	<i>(h)</i> and 	<i>(i).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, paragraphs 	<i>(h)</i> and 	<i>(i)</i> do not appear to cover the point raised. If the Bill becomes law I fear that there might be circumstances in which the legitimate discharge of an order or contract may still be inhibited on pure technical grounds under clause 44(2) because paragraphs 	<i>(h)</i> and 	<i>(i)</i> of clause 45(2) do not quite cover the point. For example, they refer to dealings in
	<br><q><p>"international securities of any specified description"</p></q>
during a specified period. I do not see why that should apply to the general dealings of securities. Surely, all brokers who deal in good faith and who discharge an order on behalf of their clients should be able to do so without falling foul of clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a market maker, obliged by his role in the market to acquire a large line of stock, may be prepared to purchase further small parcels of that stock at varying prices and in an attempt to underpin the market or move it in his favour, so as to flatten his book at a profit or reduced loss. Therefore, the clause should provide that anything done by a recognised market maker in good faith in the course of his business is allowed.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify the matter for those people operating in the market, perhaps my hon. and learned Friend will say whether he is confirming that they can carry out their business as usual, in good faith, without falling foul of the subsection, or that he intends to reconsider the matter to ensure that there is no bar. I am sure that he does not intend to change their practices in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) appears to have construed my comments more widely than I intended. I did not undertake to reconsider those matters, but I said that we would be prepared to consider a representation, if anyone presented a strong case for bringing himself under the provision, which would afford a defence to the criminal offence created by subsection (2). Defence is perhaps a more appropriate word than exemption, which was the word I used when replying earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not convinced that such a defence should be provided for every market maker, and my hon. Friend should not, therefore, take more comfort from my words than I intended. We are prepared to consider any representations made, which would extend the scope of defences for which the Bill currently provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not entirely accept the comments of my hon. and learned Friend about the meaning of the words "for the purpose of; They also appear in subsection (1), but that also uses the words
	<br><q><p>"knows to be misleading, false or deceptive",</p></q>
whereas subsection (2) refers to an impression. Clearly, there is supposed to be a distinction between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
Subsection (2) also refers to "any course of conduct". Does that include doing nothing, and giving the impression of normality, when the position is not normal? For example, if a board of directors receives interim results for the company, showing a major trading loss, it is bound, by the rules of the stock exchange, to announce the results as soon as possible. However, let us assume that it decides that it would be in the interests of shareholders and employees to organise additional finance, before announcing the result, to show that the banks have faith in the company's viability. If it behaved normally, knowing that the position was abnormal, it would be guilty of a criminal offence under the subsection. That would be unfortunate because it may feel bound to disclose the results as soon as possible, which may have a damaging effect on the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is that, presumably, the company concerned would have to disclose the true state of its affairs to those from whom it sought additional finance. In those circumstances, the purpose of the delay would be to put together such additional financing, no doubt on the basis of adequate disclosure. It would not, therefore, be done for the purpose of creating
	<br><q><p>"a false or misleading impression",</p></q>
and would not come within the scope of subsection (2), even if doing nothing could be regarded as a "course of conduct" or an "act", under the provision of the subsection. Doing nothing would probably not come within the scope of those words, but it is unnecessary to express a view on that matter to deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend, which as I have explained, would not constitute an offence under the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one brief inquiry. In part II of his report Professor Gower said that in his view, directors issuing securities in their own companies would not be carrying out investment business and that they might not be caught by clause 44 as he foresaw the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question may have been dealt with, because clause 44 does not talk in terms of investment business. Will the Minister clear up that query and confirm that that is the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The omission of a reference to investment business and the reference in clause 44(2) to "any person" meet the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My concern on clause 44(4) can be summarised by saying that I fear that people may attempt to avoid setting up contracts in the United Kingdom. They may say, "We don't like the look of section 44(2) so we shall enter into our contracts abroad." That is precisely the kind of market development which we wish to avoid. I stress that I do not believe that the problem is insuperable. It is a practical difficulty and I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary could give it some thought. We do not want to create any disincentive for people to enter into arrangements or contracts in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>437</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with that. I do not want my hon. Friend or anyone else to get any false impressions in this context. We believe that in certain specific kinds of business the conduct referred to in clause 44(2) should not be an offence. We believe that such business should be specified in the rules. Where the defence of conduct in conformity with the rules was not justified, we would not want the business to be carried out in this country. That is why it has been made a criminal offence. I do not want there to be any misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a meal of this, but I am a little worried that we are enacting bad law. It is not clear to operators in the market which activities will fall within the law and which will fall without it. They are not clearly specified in clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has been unable and, indeed unwilling to say that anything done by a recognised market maker in good faith in the course of his business is allowed. In fact, my hon. and learned Friend has said specifically that that is not so and that actions taken in good faith may be illegal under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to rise by the reliance of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) on the phrase "in good faith". Surely it will not solve the problem. An action can be taken in good faith only when it is taken with reference to particular rules and standards. We are trying to establish those rules and standards, not the good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has worked in a dealing capacity in a bank or a broking firm, but to take the simplest case, when a dealer has a responsibility to discharge an order on behalf of a client, he has a proper obligation to do his best for the client. The dealer uses every legitimate means at his disposal to give, say, those who are acquiring shares every confidence that the price is underpinned, even though he may have an even larger parcel of shares to dispose of later in the day, which may materially reduce the market price of the first shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the dealer is asked by a prospective buyer of his client's shares about their share price, should he say, "In all honesty, I must tell you that I have 250,000 line of stock coming on the market this afternoon which will depress their price"? The dealer may not know whether he will definitely have that line of stock. He may only suspect as much. Alternatively, should the dealer do the best for his client at that time? The market is the market at any one moment and technically it is outside the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it from the hon. Gentleman's example that he would extend his argument not only to clause 44(2) relating to a course of conduct, but to clause 44(1) relating to false and misleading statements. If the hon. Gentleman would concede that, he would see how far that argument would take him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not concede that. I am not talking about a person who makes a statement which he knows to be misleading but about technical market operations where, for example someone may want to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
flatten his book at a profit or at a reduced loss. Such a transaction can be conducted legitimately. I share the fear of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Recognised market dealers who are inhibited from carrying out bids or offers on certain major lines of stock in one market, may put that business through another market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend referred to the conduct of business rules set out in clause 45. But clause 45(1) states that although those rules apply to authorised persons, they do not apply to members of recognised SROs. Those organisations may have similar rules of their own. According to the Minister, I need have no fears about clause 44(2) because of the provisions contained in clause 45; however, SROs are exempted from clause 45.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 12 proposes that the SROs will be subject to the SIB to a greater extent. Therefore, we should be able to apply the conduct of business rules to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want contracts to be entered into abroad which could otherwise be entered into here. I hope that the Minister—and the SIB—will acknowledge that there is a danger which we can avoid, and that it can be dealt with effectively under the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there is a danger; I agree that it can be avoided; and I agree that it can be dealt with under the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) begs the question by the use of the terms "in good faith" and "legitimately". Clause 44(2) creates an offence where a person carries out an act or
	<br><q><p>"engages in any course of conduct which creates a false or misleading impression, as to the market in or the price or value of any investments'"</p></q>
if that act or course of conduct is committed
	<br><q><p>"for the purpose of creating that impression".</p></q>
That point does not lie easily with the concepts of good faith and legitimate conduct. There may be practices which would justify the creation of a defence to this offence. That is the context in which we would consider any suggestions for broadening the scope of the defence which is provided under clause 45. However, that should not apply to all market makers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 45(1) provides that those rules will not apply to members of SROs only where they are subject to the rules of that organisation, rather than those of the designated agency. It would be possible, by the use of the designated agency's rules, to ensure that clause 45 applied in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 237, in page 29, line 10, leave out "may" and insert "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 45 deals with the conduct of business rules, and subsection (2) lists the provisions that "may" be made under those rules. What is the point of listing provisions that "may" be made? Why not just say that anything may be covered? If the provisions listed are important, why not say that they "shall" be incorporated in the conduct of business rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is both unnecessary and unusual. It would be highly unusual to impose such a mandatory requirement. The rule-making powers will be transferred to a designated agency, but before doing that the Secretary of State will have to satisfy himself on the content and the coverage of the rules proposed by the agency. The provisions in clause 96(8)	<i>(b)</i> require that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the rules afford investors an adequate level of protection and that they comply with the principles set out in schedule 6. Therefore, there is no need to impose a mandatory requirement in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found that ministerial reply both unnecessary and unusual. Schedule 6 lays down several matters which must be dealt with in the business rules. Paragraph 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"The rules made under section 45 of this Act … must promote high standards of integrity and fair dealing".</p></q>
Several other matters are dealt with in schedule 6, including the disclosure of commission. Why are matters in schedule 6 mandatory, but matters in clause 45 permissive? If some provisions in clause 45 are not imposed on the SIB and the SROs, Parliament will be unable to insist on certain matters that we wish to see in the conduct of business rules. One defective aspect of the legislation is that we have only just had the draft conduct of business rules, and it is difficult for us to insist on particular issues. It was clear when we talked about the disclosure of commissions that if we want to insist on those matters we shall have to do so through schedule 6. What is the difference in principle between schedule 6 and clause 45?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend overlooks the fact that the Secretary of State must be satisfied on several matters, including the required degree of investor protection, before he can transfer the powers to the designated agency. He is accountable to Parliament for his decision to transfer such powers, and if Parliament is dissatisfied with a decision of his about the degree of investor protection to be provided, it can call him to account for any decision to transfer powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not intended that the legislation should prescribe in the detail suggested the rules and how the designated agency and SROs should approach their tasks. We intend a framework to be provided to impose certain requirements as to the degree of investor protection which must be provided before the Secretary of State can transfer his powers, which is why there are mandatory requirements in schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is to be accountable to Parliament for how he exercises his discretion on the transfer of his powers giving hon. Members that degree of control. If mandatory requirements on the rules of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
designated agency and the SROs were written into the Bill, it would alter the balance of the framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I agree that the analogy with schedule 6 lies uneasily with clause 45. I have two points. First, my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary suggested that the Secretary of State would have to be satisfied about the conduct of business rules before he transferred them to the designated agency. However, once the rules were transferred, the designated agency could take out, amend or add to certain matters referred to under subsection (2). The Secretary of State would then have to decide whether to impose a rule change on the SIB or whether to take even more stringent action against the designated agency. Therefore, I do not accept that, simply because the Secretary of State can be satisfied about the rules before he transfers their administration to a designated agency, we have nothing to fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is strange that, on the one hand, my hon. and learned Friend is advocating a Bill which lays down not especially detailed but quite specific requirements, yet, on the other hand, he says it is important for them not to be too detailed, and that we should maintain a balance, and stay open and flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government introduced the Bill because of dissatisfaction with the flexibility and ease with which businesses can carry on practices uninhibited by the law. We are passing law, and ought to have the courage of our convictions to say that it should be law. I agree, therefore, with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, and my hon. and learned Friend should have less to fear and be more prepared to accede.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take issue with my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) on his comments about the purpose of the legislation. We do not aim to replace something flexible with something that will be less flexible and more rigid because it has the force of law behind it. That is far from the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, large parts of investment business are unregulated. Under the legislation, we aim to provide a flexible and effective regime and, therefore, it is desirable that the framework should provide maximum flexibility. Subsection (2) covers the areas that rules are to cover, and is permissive in setting out the kind of subjects with which they should deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it makes no insistence that they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It makes no insistence that they should do so in specific cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. and learned Friend. When providing the Secretary of State with such a permissive power, it is important to enable him to exercise the discretion implied by that power. Otherwise, if we impose a duty on him, in respect of the wide range of issues set out in the Bill, he will be hauled before the courts, under order 53 for judicial review, at the slightest whim of anyone who thinks that that is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, having regard to those matters which are to be imposed as principles and criteria on the designated agency, it must be clear that, when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
Parliament has laid down provisions under schedule 6, there should be a way of enforcing those requirements on the designated agency. I shall not go into the details of clause 96, but it contains provisions, which clearly prescribe a test of equivalence, enabling us to ensure that the proper tests are applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comments of my hon. and learned Friend, and it would be unwise to accede to the suggestion that the word "shall" should replace "may".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 29, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>	<i>(aa)</i> prescribing levels of capital adequacy and prohibiting a person without the prescribed level from carrying on investment business.".</p></q>
This amendment flows on naturally from the previous debate. The fixing of capital adequacy levels is one of the most important functions that the designated agency is likely to undertake. It is certainly one of the most important matters with which it will be concerned, yet no reference is made to that specific matter in subsection (2), identifying the rules to be covered. Indeed, it is difficult to see under which provision of that subsection a rule governing capital adequacy would fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) gives a wide, general rule-making power, which covers the ground, but I am nevertheless puzzled why, given that it is felt necessary to list the specific rule-making capacities in particular areas in subsection (2), one of the most important areas or at least one of the most important rules, should be omitted. Will the Minister say whether its omission was deliberate and, if it was, why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not deliberate. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the purpose of the rule-making power as specified in subsection (2) is to show the matters on which rules may be made. We are considering whether those powers are wide enough to enable effective provision to be made on capital adequacy and we have invited SIB to say what rules it would propose if powers were transferred to it. If we concluded that subsection (2) is not wide enough to enable such rules to be made, we shall table appropriate amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>	<i>"(I)</i> requiring the disclosure of the anticipated future amount or value of the investment at specific points in time, including on death or early surrender, and the manner in which the amount or value may be determined.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated the principle of the amendment when we discussed clause 41 and I do not want to repeat that debate in detail. However, it is important that we consider what should be disclosed to an investor and whether it is adequate to deal merely with the question of commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) spoke most eloquently on commissions, on the differentials on disclosures that might be required, and especially on the possible problems with the different relationships between tied agents independent intermediaries. I do not wish to enter into that discussion, because there are more fundamental issues at stake, which we should consider in greater detail than is provided under clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance contracts that are held out as investments are an animal with two parts. One is the pure insurance element—the risk element—and the other is the investment element. It is possible to separate those two elements and to tell a purchaser the value of the risk element, which is sold independently. We should also be concerned with the investment element. An insurance company selling an investment says, "Give us your money and allow us to invest it for you. We can invest it better than you can."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any other form of investment, the purchaser can ascertain the value of what he is buying by reference to a market or, with unit trusts, to a unit value. With unit trusts and with almost every type of investment that I can envisage, the purchaser can also ascertain the charges being made to him by the seller of the investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, insurance policies are unique in that the investor cannot assess adequately what charges are being made to him. Whether the charges take the form of commission, management expenses or promotional costs, the investor has no means of ascertaining what proportion of his money is being expended on those and what proportion is being invested on his behalf. That is entirely unsatisfactory, and we must insist that whatever the details of the rules—I make no suggestion that we should be writing detailed rules— Parliament should at least lay down the principle that the information should be available to the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have a duty to insist on minimum information being made available on surrender values, although, again, we should not be involved in the detail
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
of the rules. The greatest number of complaints from purchasers of insurance policies is that at the time that they buy their policies they have no idea of the surrender values. When purchasers surrender their policies many receive nasty shocks. It is vital that we include within the rules a requirement to give some idea of what surrender values are likely to be, at given times in the life of the policy. If we insert that principle, the Committee will have discharged its minimum duty towards the contents of the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) will not be surprised to hear that I have great sympathy with the purpose of the amendment. In principle, I favour the maximum disclosure of all the information that he has identified. A number of hon. Members on the Committee have had several bites at the cherry, and the consequences are to be seen on the amendment paper. We had a first bite on clause 41, another now on clause 45, and, finally, my amendment No. 104 to schedule 6 deals with the same subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I claim no particular prescience or expertise, but following our debate last week on the subject, I think that an amendment to schedule 6 would probably be the best way to achieve our purpose. Therefore, while I am sympathetic to the principle of amendment No. 238, I feel that an amendment to schedule 6 would hit the target more accurately. Will the hon. Gentleman therefore consider supporting my amendment when we reach it, even if not necessarily withdrawing his own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that schedule 6 may be an appropriate place to insert these obligations. However, it is also important to include some provision in clause No. 45.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point; the amendments are not mutually exclusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is it suggested that we would achieve by accepting the amendment? First, we are to be asked to provide for the prospective customer the anticipated future value of a life assurance policy—of whatever sort—at specific times, and the two occasions instanced are death and surrender.

Those of us who have worked for many years in the insurance industry know that when effecting a whole life policy—the type of policy where the anticipated value at the date of death is important—there appears on almost every quotation a series of examples showing the different values of the policy if death were to occur at one of a series of dates. Without more specific information about when the death will occur, what has already been done goes a considerable way towards achieving what is suggested in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that surrender value, to which the amendment refers, is a source of considerable and understandable complaint. It is not always recognised that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
expenses anticipated over the life of, say, a 20-year endowment are accentuated at the beginning of the policy. If, for whatever reason, the policy is not allowed to run its full course and is surrendered, it is hardly surprising that the costs are accentuated over a period that is shorter than that which was anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Surely that is all the more reason why a prospective purchaser should be made aware of that problem at the time when he purchases. Surely he should be told that if he surrenders early, he will make a tremendous loss on his investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is any insurance salesman who does not offer that advice when the customer is considering the proposal, then I should entirely agree. It is a misunderstanding that has built up over the years, which has perhaps not been sufficiently explained by various salesmen more anxious to make the sale than to explain all the details. So to the extent, I entirely agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West is missing the point. Whether we look at it from the point of view of surrender value or that of estimated value on death, what is important is that we look at experience and expertise in investment. Whether one says that one expects the value of a policy at age 55 to be £2,000 or £2,500 will depend largely on how expert one's investment people are in putting the premiums, to work over that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when many life offices are under severe criticism for being too optimistic that they will be able to continue paying the high bonuses that they have paid over the past few years, we are being asked to write into the Bill estimates which, frankly, are meaningless. In. giving that the force of law, would we not create even more disappointed and disillusioned customers when they reach the maturity age or when on death their next-of-kin discover that the estimate given was wide of the mark?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underlying all that is the question of investment expertise. Why is it that over a long period you will find the same life offices appearing in the top five performers? Without wishing to give them undue publicity, year after year and irrespective of the premiums, it is the Scottish Widows', the Friends' Provident, the Standard Life, and the Scottish Equitable that do the best deal for the customer. I believe that that investment expertise is far more important than feeding in details which would be meaningless and incomprehensible to the average prospective purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, we should resist the amendment because it does not achieve the objective that I know my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West has at heart. It would be better to adopt instead the approach that has been worked out by MIBOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment requires that the proportion of premiums invested over the period of the policy be declared. With respect, that has no great meaning. One can invest a high proportion of the premium, but without adequate investment expertise and the track record of the companies I have mentioned this morning, it means nothing. Therefore, surely it is far better to go forward on the basis that MIBOC has labouriously worked out after wide consultation with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
It is at least as good for consumer protection, and the information is more accurate than that which my hon. Friend would introduce into the Bill. I share the object that animates the amendment, but the amendment would not achieve it. Therefore, the Minister should look carefully at the details of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) referred to MIBOC's consultations with the industry. That is the problem—it did not consult the consumers of insurance policies. It has sorted out a carve up that does not take into account the interests of the investor. That is clear from the response of the Consumers Association, the National Consumer Council, and the Office of Fair Trading. They all oppose MIBOC's proposals on the licensing of salesmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MIBOC's proposals can hardly be said to be in the interest of consumers, when three consumer bodies have said that they will be a bureaucratic waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has opened his speech by contradicting what I have just said, would he explain how the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) would be in the interest of the consumer—the point that I made in the other part of my speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to do that, by referring to my amendment, which, unlike amendment No. 238, does not remove paragraph 	<i>(g),</i> but adds a new paragraph 	<i>(I).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar that the most important thing for an investor to consider, when deciding which insurance policy to buy, is the past investment performance of the company. I was glad that he referred to the Scottish Widows' Fund and Life Assurance Society and to the Standard Life Assurance Co, as I have policies with both those companies. If I were to take out more insurance, I might go with one of the top five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be disclosure of commissions—and last Thursday's debate made it clear that Committee members want to see some disclosure—that would not reveal the whole picture. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) is seeking to get the whole picture. One gets that with investment and unit trusts, because one gets a figure for how much is invested in the trust and how much goes in management charges. That is the sort of thing that I think my hon. Friend wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend wants the investor who may pay a £200 premium in the first year to know whether it will all go in commission. In some cases no money is invested in the first year. I think that the investor would be interested to know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always listen with respect to the opinions of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) on such subjects, but he has not persuaded me against the amendments of my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
We must not forget the principle of equivalence of treatment. As I said in the debate on clause 41, we are demanding a great deal of disclosure about stock exchange investment. Therefore, we should favour the disclosure of full information—the whole picture, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said— about life assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not go as far as the implication in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West that disclosure of commission is unnecessary. Disclosure of commission alone is insufficient and may be misleading and the rigorous requirements for disclosure in the USA do not include the disclosure of commission. However, there are circumstances, such as when an assurance company says, such as when an assurance company pays a differential commission to encourage the marketing of some policies, in which it is in the interests of the investor to know something about commission. Disclosure of commission is not irrelevant. Where there is doubt, it is better that there should be disclosure. No harm would be done by disclosing commission if it were in the context of more complete disclosure of relevant information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the thrust of amendments Nos. 238 and 230. It is essential that the prospective investor should have available to him material facts so that he can make an educated, informed investment decision. I have an interesting document entitled "The Life Insurance Buyer's Guide" that has been produced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the United States of America. NAIC is an association of state insurance regulatory officials and helps insurance departments to coordinate insurance laws for the benefit of all consumers. The booklet is useful and it would be valuable to issue it as a standard practice to prospective purchasers of life insurance policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guide is designed to help the prospective investor to decide how much life insurance he or she should buy, the type of policy needed and how to compare the cost of similar life insurance policies. The authors and organisers of the booklet have prepared indices to enable the prospective investor to make a sensible judgment. He is advised that after he has decided what type of life insurance best fits his needs he should look for a good buy and that his chance of finding a good buy will be better if he uses two types of index numbers that help in shopping for life insurance—"Surrender Cost Index" and "Net Payment Cost Index." The indices are formulated in relatively simple terms and the pamphlet has sensible qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pamphlet points out that small differences in index numbers could be offset by other policy features or differences in the quality of service that might be expected from the company or from its agent, thus meeting the important point raised by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that the history of investment competence of insurance companies is tremendously important. That might outweigh the consideration of how much of a premium is invested on behalf of the policyholder and how much goes to the marketing and running costs of the company. Such standard brochure might commend itself to the Minister and to MIBOC. If it were carefully drafted and agreed by the industry and were made available to investors as a matter of course, it would help the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>447</span>
investor to make a sensible decision in his own best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West in advocating in his amendment that the amounts of the premium to be invested on behalf of the policyholder should be clearly stated. Although it may be an imperfect and remote analogy, donors to charities ask increasingly how much of their donations will go to charitable purposes and how much to the overheads associated in running the charity. That simple principle should commend itself in this context, too. Although I would not insist that the wording of amendment No. 238 should apply, I apply that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will give serious thought to incorporating the considerations put forward in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood correctly the observations made in this debate, three different strands of the argument on disclosure and the conduct of business in relation to life assurance seem to have become entangled. I shall see whether it is possible to disentangle them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let us put to one side a strand introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). My hon. Friend said that MIBOC had not consulted the public or the consumers. That is an allegation of which the committee could easily be acquitted, were its members here to defend themselves, because in fact they consulted widely with consumer organisations and invited comments from the public. In making that allegation, my hon. Friend referred to the denunciation that the MIBOC proposals on licensing salesmen had received from the Office of Fair Trading and other consumer bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those proposals are quite separate from the other questions of life insurance which have been referred to today. In defence of MIBOC, may I tell my hon. Friend that the original proposals for licensing were the subject of wide consultation and that those proposals met during the consultation exercise with the criticism to which my hon. Friend referred, and, no doubt largely as a consequence of the criticism, they were withdrawn and replaced by MIBOC with an entirely different suggestion which was published last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have invited comments from the public and consumer organisations as well as from the industry on the revised proposals. Those comments to be submitted within the next month so that we can move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield will, on reflection, accept that his criticisms of failure to consult were misplaced, and that we can put that subject aside while we deal with the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second strand that has been brought into the debate is commission disclosure, which was more than adequately canvassed in our debates last week. The amendments do not deal directly with commission disclosure, although it is relevant in that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) appears to see his amendment as a substitute for commission disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I sought to differentiate between commission disclosure and any comparable disclosure which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
might be required from the life offices which sell their policies through exempt representatives on the one hand, and the separate and different need for the disclosure of general information about life insurance policies, on the other. Those are two separate questions, and give rise to different considerations. I hoped that we had agreed last week that they should be considered separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. and learned Friend looks at the record of this morning's proceedings he will see that at the outset of my remarks in moving the amendment I made clear that I thought that we had put commission disclosure on one side, having dealt with it fully on clause 41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend certainly made a noble effort to direct the debate in that way, but I fear that his effort was not wholly successful and that, as he sees his amendment as a substitute for commission disclosure, we have had to touch upon that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to both commission disclosure and the wider disclosure of information that lies at the heart of my hon. Friend's amendment, I repeat what I said last Thursday—I hope that it continues to find favour with the Committee—that both matters are being considered by MIBOC as a matter of urgency. I said then that I would invite MIBOC to consider them as a matter of urgency. That invitation has been extended and accepted and MIBOC is studying both questions as a matter of urgency. It hopes to provide material so that before Report we can read its thoughts thus far in general terms. I suggest that it would be wise to learn how MIBOC's thinking is developing before trying to include such matters in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also point out that the amendments are unlikely to achieve their objectives. At present subsection (2) simply provides a list of examples on which conduct of business rules can be made. There is no mandatory requirement that conduct of business rules must cover those subjects, so the amendments could not introduce such a mandatory requirement and would not achieve their objective. I hope that my hon. Friends will not press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to this short debate on my amendment and especially to the impassioned plea on behalf of the insurance industry from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). He has a lifetime of distinguished service to the industry and we respect his expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my hon. Friend missed the point that I was trying to make. The amendment does not seek to forecast an insurance company's future profits, which is a matter for the marketing of the insurance company seeking to convince investors that it can invest their money better than another company. It is appropriate for a company to draw attention to its track record and to say, "We do this better than anyone else and have done so for many years." I pay tribute to many of the companies that my hon. Friend mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to require insurance companies not to look into a crystal ball but to state categorically what percentage of the moneys that they receive for investment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
from an investor will be invested on behalf of the investor. That does not require a crystal ball but a simple calculation and a statement of intent. That is the provision that I seek to include in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I was trying to say was that it did not necessarily matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect it may matter to a lot of investors. It matters to them with almost all other forms of investment. Why insurance should be unique I fail to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, I must tell my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary that although I accept that MIBOC has engaged in wide consultation, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have received the impression that that consultation has not resulted in proposals that are acceptable to consumers or to their representative organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend remains under a misapprehension. MIBOC has not yet consulted widely on this aspect, which it has yet to address. I told the Committee last week that MIBOC said in its December document that it intended to consider those matters in due course. MIBOC has not yet considered wider disclosure. It has considered the question of licensing, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) referred, and of commission disclosure, on which we had an extended debate. This is a matter which awaits MIBOC's attention and which, following my recent invitation, it will consider urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept what my hon. and learned Friend says, which I know to be true. The point I sought to make was that where MIBOC has held consultations and considered matters, its proposals have not been widely acceptable to consumer interests. Hon. Members on both sides fear that its future consideration of these matters may equally fail to reflect consumer interests. However given my hon. and learned Friend's assurances and the fact that MIBOC has belatedly undertaken urgently to consider these matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend withdraws his amendment I should like to follow up a point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary. He sought to justify rejecting the amendments on the grounds that, following the rejection of amendment No. 237 earlier, subsection (2) is only suggesting rules that may be made, and is not mandatory. If that is true, what purpose does the provision serve? Surely it states several principles which we should like the conduct of business rules to reflect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept what the Minister says about MIBOC considering the matter with great care, we must convey a strong message to it about the protection of investors who are thinking of buying insurance policies of this sort. The disclosure should include matters arising from the amendments such as the proportion of premiums that go into the investment and the disclosure of the future expected value of the investment at different times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), the point about the examples given in the clause is that they establish the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
vires for rules which can subsequently be made in reliance on them. That is how the powers and requirements contained in schedule 6 fit in with clause 45 and the rest of the Bill. The vires—the powers—in clause 45 would be sufficient to enable conduct of business rules to be made governing matters that we have discussed today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless there were subsequent amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, unless clause 45 were subsequently amended in a restrictive way, which no one has so far sought to do. That is why it is unnecessary to include any such suggestion in the Bill—the vires are sufficient to cover rules of conduct of business of the kind we have discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understood the Under-Secretary's argument about the vires, but it does not answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). If we read subsection (3) with subsection (1), we see that clause 45 is obviously constructed in order to give a very wide vires. The designated agency or the Secretary of State is empowered to make rules regulating the conduct of investment business, which is a very wide definition. Subsection (3) states that the list in subsection (2) is;
	<br><q><p>"without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1)".</p></q>
While I have some sympathy with the Minister's general stance, I am not sure that, in making the point about the vires, he has necessarily replied to the point made by his hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have. To reply to the point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), in respect of the relationship between subsection (2) and subsections (1) and (3), subsection (2) specifies various kinds of rule—making powers, which may be thought, arguably, to be outside the general scope of subsections (1) and (3). In case there was doubt whether specific powers came within the scope of the general powers contained in subsections (1) and (3), it was thought sensible to specify them in subsection (2). I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Although I did not raise the point when you discussed the grouping of amendments earlier, perhaps you will reconsider the grouping that you prescribed then by reinstating amendment No. 252 in the group of amendments, where it originally stood. Amendment No. 252 seeks to amend the definition of international investment and securities, as do amendments Nos. 239 and 241.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2)	<i>(i)</i> deals with a specific exemption for market stabilisation in the case of international securities. I am no expert in such matters, but it is an important point, which S. G. Warburg and Co. Ltd. has raised with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I briefly explain the concept of market stabilisation as denned by Warburg in its letter of 2 December 1985 to my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary:
	<br><q><p>"It is the custom for issuing houses in the international capital markets to over-allot both eurobonds and international equity issues and to support the price of these issues in the market, including the so-called grey market before an issue. This follows the practice in New York where such market stabilisation is specifically permitted under SEC regulations within certain defined limits."</p></q>
In that letter, Warburg quoted an example of typical wording from an American issue, and stated:
	<br><q><p>"This particular wording was extracted from the June 1977 offer of BP Ordinary shares by HM Treasury in the US. This hardly suggests that HM Treasury should regard such procedures as criminal."</p></q>
The Bill was then published and, in his reply to Warburg of 6 January 1986, the Minister said that the Bill contained an exemption for market stabilisation, but it was a more limited one than Warburg suggested. He went on:
	<br><q><p>"We felt that we should now invite a wider debate on the scope of the exemptions, and encourage both investors and issuers to contribute their ideas."</p></q>
The amendment aims to extend the exemption for market stabilisation so that it covers not only international securities but securities generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote again from a letter from Warburg to my hon. and learned Friend, dated 28 January:
	<br><q><p>"First, it is conceptually strange that a type of dealing in a security can be either acceptable or a criminal offence according to the nature of the security itself.</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
	<br><q><p>Secondly, the definition of an international security will always be difficult"—</p></q>
the definition is the subject of amendment No. 252—
	<br><q><p>"as there are always likely to be new types of security devised which do not fall neatly into any particular classification."</p></q>
I believe that the definition of international securities in the Bill is based on the EEC directive for listing particulars. It may be relevant in that context, but it may not be the right definition in the context of the Bill. The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Thirdly, if issues are carried out simultaneously in two markets such as, for example, the Reuters flotation which was carried out in both the UK and US markets, stabilisation is seen as required in practice in the US. Provisions as presently drafted could make it illegal for a UK issuing house to be involved in such an issue."</p></q>
The fourth point is that bought deals may become more common post-big bang. That is controversial because some people would not be happy to see the end of preemption rights and would prefer a continuation of the more traditional rights issues. Nevertheless, bought deals may become an accepted market practice. Warburg states that, in that case,
	<br><q><p>"stabilisation may well be necessary for the efficient working of the market. The prohibition of stabilisation in the UK market may well thus discourage innovation and cramp structural change. Furthermore, if stabilisation is not permitted, major UK companies whose shares are listed in the US may issue shares in New York through a US house."</p></q>
The amendment deals with market development and professional investors. We are a long way from the small, private, domestic investor. We want to see whether exemption can be extended without damaging investor protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 239 to 241 contain a series of connected proposals to widen the class of investments for the purpose of subsection (7). I shall come to amendment No. 252—which is slightly separate, notwithstanding my point of order—in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) provides that nothing done in conformity with rules made under subsection (2)	<i>(i)</i>, which refers to the stabilisation of the price of the qualifying investments
	<br><q><p>"before or during a specified period following their issue",</p></q>
is a contravention of the criminal offence in clause 44(2) relating to misleading practices. The amendments are important because they relate to the definition of a serious criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in amendments No. 239 and 240 have no substantive effect. They change only the label or description applied to the class or description of the qualifying class of investments. The class itself is defined in subsection (6) by reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantive amendment which goes with amendments Nos. 239 and 240 is amendment No. 241, which would extend the class of investments whose price may be stabilised. It would add "shares" and "instruments entitling to shares" to "debentures" and "Government and public securities" whose issue may already be the subject of rules made under 45 (2)(i).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the amendments aim to introduce into the Bill provisions that parallel similar arrangements in United States law for making rules on stabilisation in relation to securities. I have much sympathy for such provisions. With the increasing internationalisation of financial services, it is important for the system
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>453</span>
of regulation in the United Kingdom to be compatible with the regulatory systems overseas, so long as such systems provide acceptable standards of investor protection. I understand that stabilisation developed out of new issue practice in the United States. But I am also aware that United States securities law specifically treats stabilisation as a form of market manipulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United States, rules on stabilisation date back to the 1940s. They run to over two and a half pages. We do not have such rules in the United Kingdom. Practitioners in the Eurobond market are already considering what such rules should provide and what safeguards they should offer investors. The Securities and Investments Board has also considered this matter. When the Bill was published in December we believed that the safeguards would be adequate, provided the lawful practice of stabilisation was restricted to securities normally traded only by persons who could be expected to understand the issues and risks involved. Hence, stabilisation was limited to international securities, defined as investments falling within paragraphs 2 and 3 of schedule 1—that is "debentures" and "Government and public securities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government would consider extending the qualifying class of investments if there were a convincing case. Adequate rules would need to be devised to protect investors if the investments subject to stabilisation were likely to be bought or sold by investors other than the professional or business investor who could be expected to understand the risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about "shares" which are identified in paragraph 1 of schedule 1. Rules made under clause 45(2)	<i>(i)</i> would have to provide safeguards if shares were subject to stabilisation and if we were to accept that the scope of subsection (6) should be widened. I should welcome the views of the Committee on this matter. However, at the moment I cannot commend amendments Nos. 239 to 241 to the Committee, because the way in which rules could provide safeguards must be considered further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative proposed in amendment No. 252 is defective because, although it establishes a definition for an "international investment", there are no corresponding amendments referring to clauses that mention "international securities". For example, in clauses 45(2)	<i>(i)</i> and 123(1)	<i>(c)</i> the term "international investment" is presumably meant to replace "international securities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the purpose of amendment No. 252 is to enlarge the qualifying class of relevant investments to encompass all the investments in paragraphs 1 to 11 of schedule 1 which are issued or created by foreign persons, bodies or organisations, or are denominated in currencies other than sterling, or may be dealt in outside the United Kingdom. The effect would be to include all other forms of investment, including futures and options and even long-term insurance contracts. The amendment also redefines the "international" aspect by restricting the category to investments not normally dealt in by non-business investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised by the breadth of the amendment. It would make stabilisation in the financial futures markets lawful, subject to rules. The amendment defines too broadly the type of investment which may be exempted by rules made under clause 45(2)	<i>(i)</i>. None of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>454</span>
firms or bodies that I consulted wished to see the exemption drawn so broadly. Furthermore, the provision in the amendment give no real safeguard that the investment would not normally be dealt in by non-business investors. I therefore urge the Committee to resist amendment No. 252.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is taking us into arcane territory. I, too, received a letter from Warburg and read the words that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) quoted to the Committee. I am still not sure what the justification is for the practice of market stabilisation. It seems to me that there are two major questions. First, should market stabilisation be allowed at all? The Government have answered with a partial yes by virtue of the provisions in clauses 45, 46 and 47. Secondly, if it should be allowed, where should the boundaries for the exemption be drawn?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where my confusion arises. The Minister seemed to be making a case directed towards the international nature of the securities and so to the nature of that market and of the expertise of the people dealing in it. That is what one would expect from reading clause 45(6), which states that the regime should be based on the expertise of those people. However, I thought that the Minister was also saying that it might be desirable to conform with the United States practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Warburg pointed out, if there were a major divergence between British practice and that of the United States there could be a shifting of business, at least in the case of some securities which could be traded in either market. In any case, the arbitrageur would quickly make up whatever difference might emerge in the two markets. Will the Minister say which of these two bases he feels is the right one on which to approach the matter? Will he explain more fully why market stabilisation should be allowed at all? Will he also explain why he has accepted the argument in respect of international securities as defined in clause 45 when that part of his argument relating to American practice seems to extend beyond that category of security?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Minister invited members of the Committee to give their views. I do not know whether he mentioned that invitation to our hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson). However, I shall accept the invitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of those who wish to see business in London grow in the same way that it grows in the United States may come up against the interests of those who want to give maximum investor protection. I understand the worries of firms like Warburg who do not wish to see business drift away to the United States. However, I think that there is a counter argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If standards of investor protection are higher in Britain, even though the issuers may have an interest in taking their issues to the United States because they can do so on easier terms, investors may have an interest in coming to London. Therefore, higher standards of regulation could result in London's business increasing because investors will like the protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) mentioned the matter of the bought deal, which I think is a questionable practice. There is no proof that it is in the interest of shareholders to give up their pre-emption rights. I hope that that will be considered carefully before London abandons its position on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

It has been suggested that market manipulation could take place between professional investors in dealings in bonds, though perhaps not in shares. Price stabilisation is market manipulation which involves rigging a price to a point that it would not reach if the market were left to operate freely. That seems to be a return to the sort of practice about which we expressed concern on the previous clause. It is the deception of investors— allowing them to think that the price of a newly-issued bond is 99 when it would be only 95 if left to the free market. Therefore, we must be careful where we allow stabilisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary draw a distinction between professional investors and non-professional outside investors, because it was the distinction that I was trying to make earlier. I hope that if we allow market stabilisation it will be tightly constrained, with a ring fence around it, because otherwise less well-informed investors might be tempted to purchase shares on a basis that did not reflect their true value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said on schedule 1, there is a problem with market stabilisation. It is essential that proper regulation of supply is maintained throughout the world. On schedule 1, I mentioned the stance adoped by the president of Nigeria in welcoming movements towards greater stabilisation of markets. When I dealt with amendments concerning the futures market I said that it was important to remember that when the American market took on a degree of self-regulation, it expected that the British market would succeed at its expense, but the reverse occurred. Therefore, I endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) that it is important to ensure that we follow practices that attract people to the British market. It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of stability of supply in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of balancing two conflicting objectives, because I imagine that every Committee member wants to see London develop as a market, and also wants to see adequate investor protection. It is difficult to make a judgment about an issue as technical as market stabilisation. However, it is designed not to trip people off, but to even out the volatility that would otherwise occur. New issues provoke more price volatility than more mature issues. Market stabilisation is designed to help investors, not hinder them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) knows as much, or as little, about this as I do. The quotation about American practice which he read out from the Warburg letter specified that the purpose of stabilising the market was to maitain the market price of ordinary shares above the level might otherwise prevail on the open market. Therefore, market stabilisation does not merely stabilise the price. It raises it above the free market price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was relying on what Warburg said in the letter that the hon. Member for Dagenham has. it said:
	<br><q><p>"the objective of stabilisation is to reduce the risk to the investor during the initial stage of distribution, when there is a much larger
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
volume of trading and hence volatility in price than in the case of a more mature issue when the securities have 'settled down'."</p></q>
I do not pretend to be an expert on the markets, but I wanted to ensure that the matter was aired. We have had a useful debate and I am grafeful to my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary of State for saying that he will consider the matter further. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 30, line 17, leave out from "mentioned" to end of line 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No 52, in page 30, line 17, leave out
	<br><q><p>"except that the shall not impose" and insert "including the imposition of."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment leads us to the question of what precise rule-making powers should be included in clause 45. Clause 45(3) goes out of its way, uniquely, to specify not what matters might be within the rulemaking power, but what matters shall not in any circumstances be within the rule-making power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is odd; the power to make rules is generally permissive—as we have established this morning—so why should fixing the maximum commission to be obtained in investment business be the one respect in which the Secretary of State or the designated agency will have no power whatsoever to make rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's ideological preconceptions and prejudices are apparent here. The Government see no point in having the power because free competition will inevitably prevent people from exceeding the maximum permitted by the market place. According to that theory, the provision is unnecessary, although the theory does not explain why it should be removed altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many people, not only Opposition Members of the Committee have looked at this question and are not persuaded that in every case competition will produce the acceptable consequences that the Government expect. There are even signs that the Government are prepared to look at certain situations where competition alone will not determine what Commissions should be charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government, through MIBOC, are prepared to contemplate a voluntary agreement within the industry on what commissions ought to be charged in certain circumstances. That voluntary agreement would function as a corollary to, or substitute for, the full disclosure of commissions. The Government might then argue that competition, plus the requirement to disclose, will prove an effective combination, and that there is no need for a statutory rule allowing intervention in even the most extreme circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many people, again, do not believe that as effective disclosure as we are likely to get, plus voluntary agreement, will provide the required level of investment protection and the control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite two authorities. Professor Gower, in parts I and II of his report, says that he does not believe that disclosure plus voluntary agreement will be effective but that some element of rulemaking, or statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
intervention, will be required. The second body of opinion comes from the consumer organisations which are opposed to the idea that disclosure alone will be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with two prongs to the argument: does the Minister genuinely believe that the rule-making power is not required, and that disclosure plus a voluntary agreement will be enough? The second and more difficult question, even if the Minister takes that view, is why does he feel it necessary to strike out even the possibility of making such rules? The Secretary of State can make rules on a whole range of subjects, but in this respect he is told that he has no power to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost as though some unspecified presence, lurking in the background, will pose such a temptation to the Secretary of State, or the designated agency, that even the temptation itself must be exorcised from the Bill. One marvels at the extent to which the Government are so hagridden that they have to strike from the Bill even the possibility of a permissive power to make such rules should they ever prove necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister think that the regulation of commissions will work if there is no such power? Why has he felt it necessary to strike out even the possibility of exercising that power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have struck out nothing; I have simply added an exception which the hon. Gentleman would prefer not to see. If a measure is inappropriate, there is no point in making provision for it in the legislation. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) correctly anticipated why I think it inappropriate. A combination of competition and disclosure will provide a sufficient safeguard and will ensure that the industry works to benefit the consumer as well. It would be unnecessary and wrong to include such a power in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to contain myself during our debate to allow Conservative Back Benchers as much time as possible. But I cannot understand the Minister's reasoning. It is ludicrous that he should specify an exception in that way. Why is that particular area sacred? Why can no rule be introduced that interfered with the industry's right to set levels of commission?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister expect commissions to fall or to rise following the introduction of the arrangements? Does he expect some movement in the profile of commissions being paid throughout the industry? What does he foresee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no claims to prophesy the future of commissions in the industry. But the additional provisions for disclosure, combined with competition, should enable the consumer to have a more informed choice and to get a better deal than would be possible without this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister astonished me when he said that he had struck out nothing by the wording of clause 45(3). Clause 45(1) and the opening words of clause 45(3) provide the widest possible rule-making power across the spectrum of the conduct of investment business. We have no quarrel with that. Clause 45(2) settles any doubts that might arise on the far outer regions of the great generality of rule-making powers. Clause 45(2) sets out a substantial list of areas which might have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
fallen into doubt. I am astonished that that should be so; nevertheless, it is the reason we were given for the existence of clause 45(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an extensive list of yet further specific powers which can settle any doubts. But after all its efforts to identify the far reaches of the rule-making power, the clause says, in effect, "There is one little bit where no rules must ever be made. In case the thought ever entered your mind, it must be banished immediately and, in case we cannot rely on you, we shall do it by specifying those words in clause 45(3)."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he had struck nothing out, but clause 45(3) use's the words
	<br><q><p>"except that they shall not impose".</p></q>
Those words are mandatory in a negative sense and mean that this is the one area where rules are not to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As when I moved the amendment, I despair of persuading the Minister, who is so firmly embedded in his ideological position, to re-examine the question. Unless my hon. Friends wish to contribute to the debate—I see no sign of movement on the Conservative Benches—I fear that we must press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For example,
	<br><q><p>"Professionals may be cold-called; they need not be warned about the risks of off-exchange investments"</p></q>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to have the amendments grouped together. They would import some of SIB's ideas into the Bill. Amendment No. 251 refers to the fact that business investors need less protection and tries to define a business investor for the purposes of this and subsequent clauses. The amendment is based on the ideas in the SIB document but it identifies two particular categories of investors—investment professionals, whose main business is buying and selling investments or giving advice, and professional managers of institutional funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary may argue that that is unnecessary and that SIB has made its position clear, but there would be an element of reassurance if we could include a reference to what I regard as an important concept in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept is important because professional or business investors are important. They account for a large proportion of the market; the hold about 80 per cent of the shares of UK companies; and they are important in economic terms. If London is to become a successful financial centre, it is they who will make it so. Furthermore, the concept is important because small variations in the rules applying to professional markets can make large practical differences to what happens in practice and where people decide to do their business. We all know from previous debates that there is a considerable ability to shift business round at short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not explain the amendments in detail. They refer to subsequent clauses on cancellation rules and unsolicited calls and their aim is to include some of those concepts in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to spell out in clause 45 some of the factors to which the Secretary of State, or the agency, should have regard when making conduct of business rules. I do not suppose that anyone would disagree with either of the propositions put forward in the amendment. The impact of proposed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
rules on the UK's competitiveness and efficiency is certainly a factor that should be considered, as should the differing needs of different groups of investors and the importance of avoiding over-regulation. All are among the objectives that the Government had in mind in designing the new framework for investor protection, but a requirement of the kind proposed in the amendment is not the right way to achieve those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require the Secretary of State or the agency to have regard when making rules to two factors only. In this case, both would point in the direction of light regulation. There is no corresponding obligation to have regard to other relevant factors such as, most importantly, the need for adequate investor protection for all investors. Certain basic safeguards, such as honesty and fair dealing, should apply to everyone and are essential if the UK is to be seen as a clean place to do business. Without such a reputation, we shall lose business. Some who would be classified as business investors under the clause may in any case want much of the protection afforded to private investors by, for example, a "know your customer" rule and they should not be denied such protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Bill should enable different rules to be made governing the position of different investors— that is what the Bill does—it would be unnecessary and undesirable to introduce the specific provisions in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister and members of the Committee to an interesting article in 	<i>The Times</i> today by Mr. Michael Prest and suggest that they read it. Although I do not agree with everything in the article, its general import is that we should make sure that we do not over-regulate. I am sure that in the advice that will be given to the SIB and in their own deliberations the Government will do their best not to over-regulate the City, as that would be detrimental to the Bill's objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was particularly pleased that the Minister made the point that Opposition Members have argued throughout our discussions on the preparation of the Bill, that effective regulation is not a deterrent to doing business in London; in many ways it is the very reverse.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And by Sir John Nott, no less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, by someone who has been a Secretary of State for both Defence and Trade.

I hope that when he is moving amendments, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will tell us the source of those amendments so that we can understand them in context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore that last contribution, because up to now we have had some reasoned debate. I actually read from a letter from Warburg. The hon. Gentleman has also forgotten that I moved the amendment to give SIB the power to change the rules of SROs and to say that I simply want a laissez-faire regime is nonsense. The hon. Gentleman should understand that there are real anxieties in the City. It is convenient for the Opposition to try to tar the entire City with the same brush, but the people there are not crooks and the hon. Gentleman knows that very well.

The financial services industry is a major, expanding industry. Of course, up to a limit, I accept the point made by both the Opposition and my hon. and learned Friend that it is in the interests of market development that there be effective investor protection. However, there is a fear that if we go too far, we shall drive business offshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody accepts the distinction between a professional investor and a non-professional investor—it is in the SIB red book. It is useful to have had the debate and to know that those distinctions will be in the rules and it is important that we get those rules right. My amendment was not intended to exclude other considerations and my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary accepts the two considerations which are included in the amendment.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of the time and of the groans from my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson). However, I should like to raise just one point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the extent to which the rules will regulate the conduct of employees, although no doubt my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would say that it would not be right to add that to the clause because of the principles governing what should, and what should not, be in the clause. However, there is scope for abuse by employees who control large sums of money, and I shall return to the issue under schedule 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly because I want to press further the case that was put by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) when he was examining the words "shall" and "may" under the first amendment to this clause. This is my only opportunity under clause stand part to seek information from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><q><p>"Rules under this section may in particular make provision". Am I to understand that the designated authority, before being designated, must come to the Secretary of State with a set of rules and only when he has approved them will he provide designation? If that is the case, can I further presume that SIB or MIBOC will be required to come back to the Secretary of State in the event of their wanting to amend those rules further? If they are not required to come back to the Secretary of State to amend the conduct of business rules, how can we be sure that there will not be a diminution of the responsibility that they undertook prior to being designated and which Parliament had expected of them?</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
