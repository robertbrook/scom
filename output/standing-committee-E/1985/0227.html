	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to welcome the Committee back to its old haunt, but we shall have to make the best of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons of which the Committee is well aware, 	<i>Hansard</i> has not been able to produce the reports of our past two sittings. The record of Tuesday's morning session may become available this morning. The record of the afternoon sitting should be ready some time today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXEMPT REPRESENTATIVES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 209, in page 25, line 33, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 210, in page 25, line 36, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
	<p>No. 211, in page 26, line 7, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
	<p>No. 212, in page 26, line 16, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
	<p>No. 213, in page 26, line 27, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
	<p>No. 214, in page 26, line 30, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
	<p>No. 215, in page 26, line 37, leave out "exempt" and insert "appointed".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chapter IV is headed "Exempted Persons". However, most of the persons with which it deals are bodies: the Bank of England, recognised investment exchanges, clearing houses, and Lloyd's. Clause 42 exempts various officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 is the only clause that exempts persons other than officials. It does that because the investment businesses that employ those persons will be responsible for them. That deals with the deficiencies in the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, which exempted so many persons and bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although the employers of those persons will take responsibility for them, I am worried by the description "exempt". If such a person were to go out selling life insurance as a tied agent, the investor whose door he has knocked on may say, "You must be governed by the Financial Services Act 1986"—he would be a well informed investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I'll say!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a putative combination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
The representative could say, "I am an exempt representative", and the investor—not being that well informed—would assume that the representative was not covered by the legislation at all. That would be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the amendments is to change the name of appointed representative. That would make it clear that the representative's company takes responsibility for him. It is a matter of presentation rather than substance, so I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary will look on it favourably</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with my hon. Friend's amendments. My postbag would have been a good deal lighter, if I had inserted a different phrase into the Bill in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Appointed representative" is perhaps not the best phrase. An alternative phrase that is competing for my affection is "accountable representative". Therefore, I should like to leave the matter today. I shall bring forward Government amendments later to achieve a change that accords with the spirit behind my hon. Friend's amendment, although I may not use his terminology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful. I do not want to enter a debate on the merits of alternative terminology. I think that "accountable" may be as attractive as "appointed". On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 25, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"save that the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 6 to this Act shall apply to any such exempted representative as if he were an authorised person.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment stands in my name and that of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). It requires disclosure of commission and other details by all those selling, but particularly by tied agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has generated a great deal of correspondence for us all as it is of deep concern to many people operating in this sphere. The issue is complex and is not amenable to easy solution. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar may take a different view, but my purpose in moving the amendment is to initiate a debate to explore the Committee's views and determine the Government's attitude. I would not go as far as to say that the purpose of the amendment is to probe, but I hope that it will bring out issues that are causing anxiety. In the light of the debate I shall decide whether to press the amendment to a vote. So, although the amendment has a probing character, that does not underestimate its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all received a large volume of correspondence, much of it from those who have a clear vested interest one way or the other in the matter. Their anxiety is real and powerful and we must take account of it. Their worries are important but not vital; they believe that the Bill places independents at a severe disadvantage. I shall read an extract from a letter that I received this morning which encompasses that point well. It is from Mr. Bangs, the managing director of Corporate Services Limited, who puts the independents' view:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal that tied agents should be able to sell other Companies products through agencies held by their main Company can not be right. Either a tied agent is tied to one company and must inform his/her clients of this or he/she is independent. You cannot be both: If it was the case, then I should be able to take out main agencies with a number of companies through my Ltd Company and then offer my services to that Limited Company as a tied agent.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This proposal is completely contrary to the MIBOC Committee's own declared objectives of polarisation and clarification."</p></blockquote>
We are considering proposals put forward by MIBOC, and no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if intervene here. The hon. Gentleman has referred to proposals put forward by MIBOC. In fact, the only proposals put forward by MIBOC relate to polarisation. MIBOC has not proposed any middle ground that would allow tied agents to sell the products of other companies. It received representations to that effect after the issue of its first consultative document and so thought it right to consult on that issue in its latest document, but the suggestion of a middle ground does not come from MIBOC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I am sure that what he says is correct, although it will do little to calm the considerable and understandable fears. I am sure that the Minister will agree that those fears are understandable because many people in the independent sector believe that the proposals will be so discriminatory that they will remove, or drastically alter, that sector, and create an impetus to move across to tied agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Bangs adds that it is proposed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"professional firms, estate agents, small building societies etc who are not able or willing to offer a full and proper independent service, should be allowed to conform to less vigorous standards than full-time professional intermediaries. Does this include the butcher the baker and farmer etc who has an agency with one of the old traditional Companies."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Bangs proceeds to make a number of other points with which I shall not burden the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read out that letter because it echoes clearly the industry's concern but that should not necessarily be our major concern. Our primary consideration should not be the interests of this or that vested interests group, but proper protection for the investor, even if the necessary legislation has knock-on consequences requiring the industry to change in due course. The investor must come first, not those many people who have written to us, even though their fears are real.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn now to the investor in that sector. All Committee members agree that we are dealing here with the most vulnerable and unsophisticated investors considered under the Bill. Those investors will be sold investments, not in the professional, formal surroundings of their office, but in their own homes. They are peculiarly vulnerable because they usually have little knowledge about such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sector of the market place has already grown considerably, and is likely to continue to do so. There are several reasons for that. The Government have encouraged wider share ownership, and, since the last war, we have seen a considerable growth in the number of owner-occupied homes. The second generation is now beginning to inherit and sell homes purchased by their parents, so they have large sums of money to
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
invest. That process is new, but is likely to continue and to grow. There has been a growth in the pensions industry, which means that many people will receive lump sums on retirement, which they will wish to invest. There is also the more unhappy fact that we are now seeing a period of relatively high unemployment, and a significant number of people are receiving large sums of redundancy pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market is, therefore, not only vulnerable, but growing, and we must give consideration to it. We should operate a number of basic principles in approaching the market. First, I hope that the Minister will agree that the principle of tapered safeguards, as I shall call it, underlies the Bill. In other words, fewer safeguards are needed at the more professional, Eurobond end of the market, than at the bottom end of the market, which we are discussing, where caveat emptor is more appropriate and the safeguards must be stronger, more precise and more particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in the future—we cannot achieve it immediately—those people operating in the specialist market place should have at least some competency through training. At present, almost anyone can walk into the market place and sell to that vulnerable group insurances about which they may not be knowledgeable. We need competency in the complexities of the tax system and the range of investments in terms of the balance of risk or reward, which is not the case at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that we can achieve that abjective immediately under the Bill, but I suggest that we aim towards it over a period of three, four or five years. There is strong evidence to support my view that more savings are lost in investment through incompetence in this area than through fraud anywhere else, so we must aim to increase competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we should aim at a system whereby all those selling in this area should be seen as agents for the investor. Many sellers already see themselves in that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, measures to safeguard investors' rights should be made available to investors in a form that they can understand. Their rights should be spelt out to them, perhaps accompanied by a leaflet or other document explaining their rights. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) touched on that possibility during his short speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, several specific safeguards should be considered. We shall discuss a cooling-off period later so I shall not stray onto it now. Also, we should consider the nature of a sale and whether it comes from one company or from a permitted range. There should be access to some independent advice. Lastly, the amendment seeks to provide some information about what benefits accrue to the seller of the policy rather than to the buyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the centre of the argument is information about commission. I have no preference on whether that information is presented in the form of an industry norm or standard or as a total amount. It is a matter of fine balance. The appendix to the Consumers' Association document showed the great variation in commission. I shall not dwell on that variation now, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
commission that the seller will gain from the sale must be presented to the buyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want equivalence of treatment and safeguard between independent and tied salesmen. For independent salesmen, there could be a declaration of commission, as is proposed, and it could be made in terms of an overall amount or in terms of an industry standard. I do not mind. The industry standard may be the more elegant method, provided—this is important—that the scale of the industry standard is incorporated in the rules of the SRO. It must be shown to the buyer at an early stage in a form that provides written notice of the commission and of the buyer's other rights, and we must place a clear and unequivocal ban on volume overriders for the independent salesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are difficulties about the declaration of commission for the company salesman, who is a company employee, but we must study possible mechanisms for overcoming those difficulties. We must remember that we are selling to the most vulnerable in the market place and that an employee of an insurance company is an employee in a much looser sense than other workers. He has much greater independence of operation and action than, say, an employee on the shop floor of British Leyland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission for a company employee may be smaller than other front-end loaded costs such as stamp duty on unit trusts, administration costs, profits, kickback and so on, but such commission is an important factor which should be made clear to the buyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we introduced a requirement to disclose commissions for company employees, their remuneration could be shifted from commission to direct salary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). That consequence would be good for the employees and would do no harm to the investors. It would be a result of benefit rather than of unbenefit, but I know that it causes concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of tied agents is more difficult. There are two reasons why exclusive tied agents, who sell products only for the company that employs them, should be required to disclose not only their status, but the amount of commission that they stand to earn. First, investors, especially unsophisticated ones, may think that they are dealing with an independent intermediary because the tied agent's identity is separate from that of the insurance company. Conduct of business rules may make the misunderstanding less likely, but it could still occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the different types of products, such as unit trust and insurance, that a tied agent offers may earn him different amounts of commission and produce a possible bias. Therefore, the investor should be told the amount of commission in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong and anti-competitive to ban tied agents from being non-exclusive so that they could not offer products other than those of their company. It would make it difficult for a small firm to start up with a narrow range of products if it could not offer the consumer a full service. Non-exclusive agencies should
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
be allowed to continue to offer their own and other companies' products, provided that a full range of services is offered. Therefore, if the agency's company could provide only a narrow range of services, the agency could offer a full range of services by acquiring agencies for other companies' products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under those circumstances, what is there to stop tied agents, who have a wide range of additional products on offer, becoming independent intermediaries? According to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ash-down), those agents are independent intermediaries in all but name. It would confuse the consumer still more if there were independent intermediaries who offered a wide range of advice, and tied agents who were not really tied, but offered a wide range of advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. However, where a tied agent is able to offer other companies' products, the company that employs the tied agent is responsible for the other products. The company chooses the other products to offer as part of its own service. The nonexclusive tied agent can take other companies' products only if his own company has given the authorisation. The flexibility is important because if non-exclusive agents were forced into an independent position it would make it difficult for new companies, offering only a limited range of services, to get started. Nonexclusive agents should be treated as tied agents and be required to disclose their commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Solicitors and accountants operating in this sector are often regarded as independent, but normally, they are not. They often offer only a limited range of products. There is a danger of confusion. Solicitors or accountants should decide whether they wish to be representatives, or to have full independent status. There should be no confusion over that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the MIBOC proposals seem to have got the role of introducers right, and I do not wish to comment on them. They are sensible and correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to provide not only an equivalence of treatment, but more important, an equivalence of treatment of different sectors in the industry. That is more important for the investor than equivalence of safeguard. I recognise that it will create problems, and I look forward to hearing from other members of the Committee on that, but we must consider not what is best to keep industry in its present shape and sectors operating in their present form, but what is best for the investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start on a note of agreement with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), my cosignatory of the amendment. We should think in terms of the interests of the investor, and I shall deal extensively with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman that to an unsophisticated member—whose interests he was endeavouring in other parts of his speech to protect— the standing of a tied agent of one company, who was permitted to hold the agencies of other companies, would be clear. The impression would be that that person was an independent intermediary. I mention that merely because the hon. Member for Yeovil mentioned it, and I shall return to it at a more appropriate stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
I remind the Committee that I act as an adviser to the British Insurance Brokers' Association, although in fairness to that body, which represents about 4,000 firms of brokers, I should say that my argument will go beyond the argument that I believe BIBA would wish to put. I wanted that independence of mind to be placed on record at the beginning of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sufficient that when dealing with a tied agent, or an exempt representative—or whatever term we shall use to describe him as the Bill proceeds—we merely give his status, whereas in the case of the independent intermediary, we have to give his level of remuneration. That seems unfair, and it seems to be short of the equivalence of treatment that independent intermediaries, who have performed a valuable service to investors over the years, have a right to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat: it is not sufficient merely to declare a status, not least because that status would not be understood by some people who were seeking to make money through an investment, but who were comparatively unsophisticated in their approach. To be told merely the status of one person who was trying to sell a life policy, but to have the earnings of another either given or implied, would bewilder the prospective investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to make the situation clear to the least sophisticated investor, who may be confronted by each of the representatives that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk in terms of the powers of the SIB and the SROs, and it is easy to forget that this Bill protects the consumer. If one sector had to take a line from which the other sector was excluded, the consumer would not be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is assumed that, because independent intermediaries can earn a great deal, at least in the initial year, tied agents and their employers are whiter than white. It is assumed that they are paid on a different and less generous basis. That is not necessarily true over the whole period of an average policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "front-end loading" recognises that most of the expenses of the sale of a policy are concentrated at the beginning of the policy, so that a substantial sum is sometimes payable. It is wrong to assume that only independent intermediaries would be guilty of making a great deal of money out of the investor. Tied agents, their employers, and others for whom they are also agents—if we concede that they should not be tied exclusively to one company—could create campaigns to attract one type of business, during which—however short the period—the commission for the tied agents could be doubled or even trebled. As such commission may not be paid as front-end loading, it may seem more legitimate. However, the tied agents would be taking advantage of the consumer. We should introduce equivalence of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable difference between disclosing status and disclosing the commission on a sale. It would not be fair to single out independent intermediaries, who render a considerable service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is too simplistic to categorise independent intermediaries as agents of the consumer, and tied agents as representatives of the insurance company. I am not

expert in the law of agency, but I know that there is a grey area in which both categories of intermediary may, at one time or another, be the agent of the consumer or of the insurance company. It is wrong to use such a distinction as the reason for a harsh dividing line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have long experience in insurance and I know many independent intermediaries and tied agents. The Gower report also backs me up. The Committee has rightly paid tribute to what Professor Gower advocated in his excellent "Review of Investor Protection". If we are to continue using his recommendations as a guide to the best form for the legislation, we should note his comment that without disclosure the investor will not know whether there is commission bias operating against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower said that exempt representatives, as well as independent intermediaries, should have to disclose commission. That is not necessarily correct just because Professor Gower said it. However, we have leant heavily on his advice, and he reached that conclusion after wide consideration. The Committee should not dismiss lightly the recommendations of such an eminent authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told by some—indeed, I may even be told by the Minister this morning—that it s not possible to devise a system of commission regulation that enables all the benefits payable to exempt representatives to be related to a single policy and that without such a system disclosure of commission is not possible. That may be so; I concede that there are difficulties. The basis of remunerating a tied agent is very different from that of remunerating independent intermediaries, largely because independent intermediaries have companies to run and staff to pay and so require front-end loading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that the Minister will not allow that to lead him to conclude that there is no reason to declare the payment received by an exempt representative. I concede that the method must be different and that as there can be no market rate, which is the basis on which MIBOC would like to see a declaration of commission by independent intermediaries, we must look elsewhere. Some of us would be satisfied if the Minster, in declaring his belief that equivalence of treatment and fairness to all intermediaries is essential, were prepared to discuss with insurance companies that employ tied agents the suggestion that they should issue periodical statements on how those men are remunerated and on what additional remuneration within the permitted rules the companies extend to their own tied agents. That might be a something of a compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might be prepared to accept the suggestion that on a case-by-case basis it would be particularly difficult to declare commissions; it is not necessarily as difficult to declare the commissions of independent intermediaries. If the Minister says that his mind is not closed to something that would give the semblance of fairness and give flesh to equivalence of treatment, which is the basis of my argument, I should be prepared to think again about pressing the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my strength of feeling on the need to extend the equivalence of treatment, and the deep-seated resentment of many independent intermediaries that they are being singled out while the tied agent is allowed to go scot-free, is such that if the Minister is not prepared to move towards the compromise that I suggest, it would be a great source of sorrow for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
I should then have to decide whether to seek the support of the Committee. If we are separated by the approach on detail, we are surely united in the belief that fairness and equivalence of treatment is necessary. That is the principal reason why I have associated myself with the amendment and why I hope that the Minister will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the amendment and have a great deal of sympathy with it because many people who would derive advantage from it are small businesses. High-powered sales forces associated with the tied agency relationship could put small businesses at a significant disadvantage, as has tended to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to criticise large companies. They provide a sophisticated package against a background of complicated tax arrangements and offer a really good service, but they have become associated with high-powered sales talk and getting a foot in the door, so I have some reservations about the way that the system has worked out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the arrangements that favour the big companies discriminate against small businesses and the intermediaries, the equivalence of treatment and fairness to which my hon. friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) referred should be given a fair wind. My hon. Friend is a great expert. I claim no expertise whatever but I am concerned for the small business man who has provided an honest, competent service. I have considerable personal experience of receiving advice from a relatively small insurance broker who has helped me and my family on innumerable occasions in dealings with the enormous insurance companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should declare a small interest. My great great grandfather founded the National Provident Institution in 1832. I have had no discussion with the institution about the Bill but I understand that it runs on a non-tied agency basis. I have considerable sympathy with the way in which the smaller companies and brokers have conducted themselves. The amendment would help them to compete more effectively with the large sales forces of the big companies, and I hope that the Minister will give the amendment the serious consideration and sympathy that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As all hon. Members who have spoken have made clear, this is a difficult area. It is difficult for the committee because we are debating an important matter at a time when many of the rules that will govern it are still being formulated. The Bill contains a spectrum of issues, as was shown by the wide-ranging speech of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), and many of them do not appear in the Bill in any direct form. We are obliged to deal with a difficult and broad area in a glancing manner because it is touched on only under clause 41, which purports to exempt tied agents from the requirements of authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other reasons why this area is difficult to regulate. As MIBOC says, millions of investments are sold every year in this area. They are sold to small investors who, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said, are perhaps the most vulnerable. They have little experience and they are almost always sold investments in the apparent security of their own homes. A vast work
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
force of 200,000 people is engaged in selling such investments. In the voluminous reading necessary for a Committee stage, I came across the astonishing fact that each week 500 people enter that work force and 500 leave it. The turnover is remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such facts give rise to concern about the competence of those selling such investments and about the methods that they use. The problem is that people do not often go out to buy such investments, which have to be sold to a passive customer. Despite its efforts during recent years, even the industry accepts that there have been difficulties and abuses and that there are genuine grounds for anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 deals with yet another complicated and complicating problem. Nearly half the business of selling life insurance is carried out by tied agents. Those agents are in a curious category, and, therefore, we are having to grapple with many problems. On the one hand, the tied agent is supposed, as a matter of law, to be independent and self-employed, and earns his remuneration through commission. On the other hand, as his title shows, he is usually tied to one company and is not, therefore, independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should direct our attention to that confusion, which must be resolved, in seeking to amend or otherwise consider the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said, the dividing line between tied and independent intermediaries is often confused, although it should, as a matter of law and practice, be clearly defined. It is more difficult to draw those distinctions than one would imagine if one were simply looking at the law books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the purist approach set out in the MIBOC document, and resist any suggestion that the clear dividing line, which should be our objective, should be muddied in any way. That is why I was a little surprised by the comments of the hon. Member for Yeovil, about his willingness for tied agents to be permitted to sell the products of other companies. Any move towards the authorisation of that middle ground, in that respect, or in relation to solicitors and accountants, or to producers, for example, is fraught with danger and would require a more rigorous approach to the disclosure of commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be a clear trade off if we moved in that direction, and, therefore, we should not do so. We should accede to the clear view expressed by many independent intermediaries, that the policy should be to require people to choose either to act as independent intermediaries—selling investment advice, as well as investments to the public—or to assimilate themselves with employees of a specific company. If we could achieve that outcome, many problems would be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals put forward so far take us some way in that direction. The requirements of disclosure of status are obviously necessary in the case of a tied agent. It should be made crystal clear to anyone dealing with a tied agent that he is dealing with an employee of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it does not arise under the clause, I favour a requirement for an even tighter written statement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
from the tied agent. In that, he would state not only that he is a representative of the XYZ company, but would go on to say specifically that he is not an independent broker, is not authorised to offer the products of another company, and is not offering impartial advice, and, furthermore, that he is paid by commission on products sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statement incorporating those elements would leave the customer in no doubt about the kind of person with whom he is dealing. It would not exclude such people from carrying out their business, but, as the hon. Member for Yeovil agrees, it might in the longer term act as an inducement to regularise the position of tied agents. If they were compelled to issue such a statement, they might as well become employees and sell the products of their employing firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must then ask whether the simple declaration of status is sufficient. In the case of a tied agent, is it sufficient to alert the prospective customer about the person with whom he is dealing? I found that matter difficult, as no doubt did the Minister, his draftsmen and MIBOC. I have wavered; as I have considered the arguments, sometimes I have taken one view and other times another. My final resting place, as it were, is that the disclosure of status is the first precondition. My view is not an "on the one hand or on the other hand" view. It is the product of long, hard thought, so we are not following the Liberal line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that declaration of status has been made, it is not beyond the wit of some of the clever people who operate in this area to leave the customer unclear about the precise status of the person with whom he is dealing. There is a limit to the effectiveness of rules and requirements laid down in statute. A clever salesman may say to a customer, "Here's the statutory form that I am obliged to give you, but you know me, I'm a good bloke, I'm offering you the best deal available." Therefore, the equivalence of treatment, which should be the underlying principle of the Bill, requires the disclosure of commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that disclosure is less appropriate to the status of a tied agent than to that of an independent intermediary. The hon. Members for Yeovil and for Brentwood and Ongar referred to the practical problems. Disclosure deals with one such problem. A tied agent will be limited to the sale of products of a particular company, but will still deal with a range of products. Unless he is required to disclose commission on that range so as to show up any differences, he could still be induced by his company through the use of differing commissions, to sell to the customer a policy which it is in the company's interest to sell, but not necessarily in the customer's interest to buy. Disclosure of commission on the range of products to be sold will safeguard the customer even when he is dealing with a tied agent and the products of one company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My anxiety was confirmed by a letter I received from someone from the north of England who drew my attention to one of the Yorkshire papers in which the Bradford and Bingley building society advertised for staff. It specified that maximisation of commission earnings would be required. That casts an interesting light on what might go wrong unless we are extremely careful. The disclosure of commission is required to regulate companies' approach to these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
I do not wish to go into the wider question of the way in which disclosure of commission should operate across the board for independent intermediaries, because that does not necessarily arise under the clause or the amendment. However, one or two relevant points have been made on the general position. The SIB's proposal that volume overriders and benefits in kind should be banned is helpful because it moves us towards equivalence of treatment on disclosure of commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that the independent intermediary may lose out. His commission will probably be higher than that of the tied agent, but the tied agent will obtain remuneration in other ways. It is, in theory, legitimate for the independent intermediary to charge an additional amount for his independent advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the independent intermediaries, who are pressing this type of amendment, we should ensure that the basis on which the disclosure is made does not unfairly prejudice one group. A move, such as that proposed by the SIB, towards banning benefits in kind would help. However, I am sure that the Minister has the problem in mind and I hope that he will help us when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with the views shared by many people on this matter, especially Professor Gower, who was quoted by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, and industry agreement on levels of commission should be included in the rules of the appropriate SRO, as should any disclosure requirements. Disclosure is a necessary pre-condition, but I am not sure that it alone will do the job. Some control, possibly statutory, but perhaps more appropriately through the rules laid down by an SRO, would help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the point made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and pay tribute to Professor Gower, who examined this difficult area as comprehensively as possible and reached well-thought-out conclusions. He said that disclosure was not enough and that some control and rule making may be required. He also advised equivalence of treatment between tied agents and independent intermediaries. That is persuasive evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 89, which has been selected for separate debate, covers the same ground as this amendment, and is intended to secure the same objective. No doubt it has been selected separately because it goes wider and specifies other matters. I should not wish anyone to think that the Opposition have not been sensitive to the legimimate concerns of independent intermediaries. We have tabled amendment No. 89 to secure a debate and, we hope, to secure the outcome for which I have argued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member clarify that? Is the discussion that he wished to take place on amendment No. 89 now taking place, and does that mean that he will not move amendment No. 89?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 89, Sir Michael, is intended to secure the same objective as amendment No. 76.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seems to deal with two aspects of the sale of insurance: disclosure, and the nature of the person carrying on the business. The nature of the person and his interests should be fully disclosed to any prospective purchaser. However, I am more worried about the nature of the disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully sympathise with the position of independent intermediaries. Historically they have acted on behalf of a purchaser, but have received remuneration from the company whose product they sell. Such a conflict of interest places them in a difficult position. I pay tribute to the industry, which has always succeeded in reconciling that conflict of interest. Nevertheless, the public has always been slightly suspicious of that relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to put independent intermediaries in the same position as tied agents in relation to disclosures of commissions. But the problem does not lie with commissions. The investor must be able to evaluate the worth of the policies that are offered. The amendment does not go nearly far enough in that direction. Even a reasonably intelligent member of the public will not be able to judge the relative value of what is on offer, whether it is offered by a tied agent or through an independent intermediary. He will have to take the intermediary's advice on trust, and he will not be able to compare products that are offered by tied agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest and sympathy. After my brief exchange of views with the Chairman, can I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's support on amendment No. 89?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly turn to that amendment when we reach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a member of the public is to make a reasonable comparison, he will need to know all the expenses incurred in marketing the product, as well as the commission that will be paid. Commission can take many forms. It may be just as relevant to know the proportion of premium income that is being spent on advertising. The investor must know what proportion of his money will be invested on his behalf, and the surrender value of the policy. Therefore I have tabled an amendment to clause 45, which I shall discuss at the appropriate time. In my view, the mere disclosure of commission does not go far enough to address the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has said his last word. Amendment No. 76 does not turn solely on commission. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6. Paragraph 5 states that the disclosures required of an authorised person are
	<br><blockquote><p>"interests in, and facts material to, transactions which are entered into by him".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 6 says that an authorised person should also disclose the capacity in which he enters a transaction.
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
That covers a broader area than commissions alone, a point which was touched on by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and I am sorry if I gave the impression that I did not accept that. But I wish to go even further than that, and to look at the total marketing costs, including money spent on advertising, promotion and management. Those costs are certainly not covered in the schedules to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only because my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and especially my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) deserve every support from this side of the Committee. I strongly share my hon. Friend's sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the Bill attempts to provide higher standards of disclosure and greater protection in the marketing of those investments, but there is a case for further consideration of the mechanisms. I am not sure whether the amendment of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) would be the best solution, but there may be a case for looking at the issue later. I support my hon. Friends' arguments, which reflect the views of many small businessmen and independents operating under difficult, competitive and demanding conditions in all constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add my strong support for what has been said, especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). We do not want intermediaries to be discriminated against although I recognise the great difficulties. My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary may argue that disclosure of apparently lower commissions by tied agents may produce the opposite effect to that which we seek. It is a complicated subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also anxious about those excellent insurance companies, such as the Norwich Union, which have traditionally not employed large sales forces or great numbers of tied agents, and which depend greatly on the recommendations of intermediaries. These companies are worried about the possible consequences of the Bill. I look forward with great interest to my hon. and learned Friend's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle of disclosure of information is fundamental to the protection of the investor. The White Paper recognised that fact and said that if market forces were to operate properly it was essential that as much information as possible was disclosed about the investments and services on offer to the customer. If that principle is to be applied here, there must be full disclosure in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to accept agreements such as the Registry of Life Assurance Commissions agreement. All commissions should be disclosed by all those selling life insurance, but I accept that such declarations are not sufficient. The investor must also understand the status of the salesman and know whether he is independent and, if he is not, his relationship with his company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I perceive the difficulty with tied agents because their remuneration packages vary enormously from one company to another. Some agents will be on a fairly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
high basic salary with a small proportion of commission. At the other extreme, a tied agent's remuneration may depend entirely on commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) that the disclosure of commission is not sufficient and that by itself it could be misleading. It is important that investors understand what proportion of their premiums is invested in management charges and what proportion will be invested in the underlying policies. It would also be helpful if investors were given comparable surrender values of different policies. It might be argued that such a measure would be overkill but it would enable the investor to make an objective judgment about the value of the policy offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision already applies to unit trusts, which must state what proportion of the cash invested goes towards management expenses and what proportion is invested in the underlying fund. One of my amendments to clause 45 has a similar objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) was right to stress the importance of the principle of equivalence of treatment. The principles of equivalence of treatment and of full disclosure are leitmotivs of the Bill and should be maintained consistently in this part of the Bill, which deals with life assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there will be any worthwhile equivalence of treatment short of full disclosure. We all agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that this is a peculiarly difficult area in which to identify what practical prescriptions would work successfully and achieve our objective. No doubt we have all shared his hesitations. We must protect the position of the independent intermediary, and that can best be done by moving towards full disclosure, whatever that means in practice. We should apply the principle in the same way as we have sought to do elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the document "Regulation of Investment Business' it is notable that the principle of full disclosure is insisted upon in the most rigorous terms, for example, in relation to stock exchange investment, yet it is attenuated for life assurance. Over the past few months I have read consultation papers and the publications of MIBOC. MIBOC has been agonising to find a solution agreeable to the industry, but without great success, judging by the correspondence that we have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make the protection of the investor fairly and squarely the paramount consideration. We all acknowledge that this area is fraught with real uncertainties and difficulties and our best lodestone is to depend upon full disclosure. Merely to disclose commission is not adequate and may be actively misleading. I agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) that we must go further and try to ensure that there is an obligation to disclose to the prospective investor all material information that will enable him to make a well-based investment judgment. That means that commission should be disclosed as well as management and investment charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
In this debate we are inevitably anticipating arguments that might be put forward on clause 45, but that cannot be helped. In suggesting that surrender values should be disclosed I am anticipating amendment No. 89. The investor should have all material facts that will enable him to make an informed decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary will look again at those issues in the light of the arguments that we have put forward</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your indulgence, Sir Michael in raising again a matter that you raised with me a moment ago. Although I fully understand why amendment No. 89 was selected for a separate debate, the arguments relevant to it have inevitably and understandably entered this debate. It may be difficult for the Minister to reply to the debate without referring to what will be required by any disclosure to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you reconsider your selection, Sir Michael, to enable us within the rules of order to debate amendment No. 89? I do not wish to make another speech, but such a course might lead to a more sensible reply from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion. In fairness to all concerned, I should like to hear what other hon. Members think. Clearly the convenience of one hon. Member may not be the convenience of another and I must balance the two. If the Minister can cope with an immediate extension of the present debate, I would regard hon. Gentleman's suggestion as most helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most interesting and helpful debate on an area that is complicated and extremely difficult. I was interested to hear from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that his mind had veered from time to time when considering the difficult issues that the question raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable consensus in the Committee. The debate will help me and MIBOC, which has been entrusted for many months with the task of following through and implementing the policy set out in the White Paper. It has been grappling with the issues in an attempt to solve the matter with fairness to the parties that market life insurance, and in a way that protects investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two points in reply to the debate. The first is that the Bill, and in particular clause 41, works in such a way that the amendment will not achieve its desired effect. The dichotomy is not between authorised businesses and exempt representatives, but between those offering independent advice and those selling their own products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point addresses the substantive issue, which has worried the insurance industry, of why independent intermediaries should be required to disclose more than company representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 41 is a general clause. It is not just about insurance intermediaries and people who sell the products of one company, although the many insurance company representatives will probably take most advantage of the clause. The fact that the clause in general affects the way in which it works, and makes the amendment unsuitable for its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
The clause puts exempt representatives in the same position under the Bill as employees of their authorised principal. Two provisions in the clause do that. Clause 41(6) makes the principal of the exempt representative responsible for the representative's acts and financially liable for him to his investment business clients. Clause 41(7) makes the acts of the representative the acts of his principal under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations that bite on an authorised person bite on his exempt representatives. The actions of an exempt representative are regulated as if they were the actions of his principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most exempt representatives work for one company at a time. The companies will be regulated as companies selling products as a principal, and will be subject to the rules on disclosure in paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6. The exempt representatives of such companies will be subject to the same rules, and will have to disclose the capacity in which they act. That is the main case, but exempt representatives may work for independent intermediaries, such as large insurance brokers. Such representatives and their principals will be subject to disclosure rules as independent intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disclosure provisions in schedule 6 will apply in all cases to exempt representatives, because they apply to their principals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members who tabled the amendment will see why it does not achieve its intended purpose. There is no simple identity between representatives of a company and exempt representatives on the one hand, and independent intermediaries and authorised persons on the other. Exempt representatives can be either company representatives or independent. Moreover, there is no need for amendments that aim to make exempt representatives subject to rules made under various parts of the Bill; their principals are already subject to the rules, so they will be too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I feel about the amendments and how clause 41 fits in to the Bill. Although the general debate on disclosure of commissions and other information may appear to be more appropriate under clause 45, which deals with the conduct of business rules, it has been raised and widely canvassed in a helpful and interesting way in this debate. Therefore, I shall now deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister would appear to be dealing with amendment No. 89, and if the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) were to agree, I should be ready to accept a debate on that amendment with this debate if both sides would find it helpful. However, I could not accept it from one side only, because that would not be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's argument carefully, and I agree that clause 41 is not necessarily the right framework for a debate on disclosure. If the Minister is prepared to answer our helpful debate, I am content, and I simply renew my invitation to him to talk about disclosures generally—as opposed to the disclosure of commissions alone—so that we can deal with the ambit of amendment No. 89, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly say something about disclosure generally; the hon. Gentleman will decide after that whether I have met the point made in amendment No. 89.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, I rule that with this amendment we shall discuss amendment No. 89, in page 26, line 28, after "principals", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the commissions paid to those exempt representatives in respect of investment business, of any other matters relating to investments, including management costs and surrender values, which an exempt representative would have to disclose by virtue of rules made under this Act if he were an authorised person".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I take it that when the amendments are put at the end of the debate, they will include amendment No. 89.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally. The usual rules apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn to the substantive issue of disclosure requirements. It would be helpful if we began by asking why we have disclosure requirements. The basic reason, which is set out in chapter VII of the White Paper, and which derives from the much older common law of agency, is to help cope with conflicts of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental conflict—which was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill)—for independent intermediaries who are remunerated by way of commission. On the one hand they are to give impartial advice to the client as between the many competing products from different companies, but, on the other hand, those different companies may pay different commissions, and it may be in the interest of the intermediary to recommend a particular product; it would never be in his immediate interest to advise that no product be bought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the conflict cannot be removed, we have to devise a route for protecting clients from conflicts of interest; that is to require disclosure of the cause of the conflict—in other words, the commission. That is how the need for disclosure of commission by independent intermediaries arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go on to the position of company representatives, which is how I believe I can most helpfully refer to them in this context, I should say what commission disclosure is not meant to achieve. It is not designed to show how much of a person's investment will be invested, as against paying sales commissions, other selling costs, costs of any pure insurance element of the package, administrative costs, or providing the company's profits, or is it aimed at showing surrender values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are separate matters and are of considerable interest to investors however they have been sold the investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for the Secretary of State of the designated agency to make rules about them, and MIBOC has been studying what should be done in that difficult matter. Indeed, it foreshadowed that in a footnote on page 9 of the document that it produced in December 1985, which stated specifically:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The questions of disclosure of total charges and of other information such as surrender values are being considered separately by the Board."</p></blockquote>
Several of my hon. Friends have raised that important matter, but it is not essentially relevant to commission disclosure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend. Perhaps he will comment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
on the fact that some companies sell their product almost exclusively through independent intermediaries, while others sell their product exclusively through their employees or tied agents. If we are seeking to enable the public to compare those two extremes, the commission element and others are directly relevant to the comparison. The line taken by my hon. and learned Friend is not as pure as he thinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not entirely agree with the point raised by my hon. Friend. There may be a case—which MIBOC is investigating—for enabling the purchaser of life insurance to know precisely how much of his money will constitute the investment part of the package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a different question at the heart of the debate, arising not from the need to provide the purchaser of insurance with complete information about where his money is going, but from the conflict of interest to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West himself referred. That arises because the intermediary is paid commission by the producer, yet is independent and, therefore, has a duty to give independent advice to the purchaser. There is, therefore, a distinction between the two matters—although there may be a relationship between them—and they are capable of being dealt with in a distinct manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now turn to the position of the company representative, whether he is an employee or an exempt representative, in respect of commission disclosure and conflict of interest. Such a person is subject to strict limitation as to the products he can sell, so he is not subject to the same conflict as the independent intermediary. Of course, he still has to sell the right product—he should not sell an endowment insurance when what is manifestly needed is a simple term policy—but other conduct of business rules will require recommendations to be suitable, given the circumstances of the client. As the basic conflict of interest does not exist, there is no need for disclosure. As with the independent intermediary, there is still scope for disclosure of economic information concerning the product—that is the point troubling my hon. Friend— but that is a separate and complex issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the company representative discloses the capacity in which he acts; that he makes it clear that he cannot offer impartial, independent advice; and that he states that he is the representative of a certain company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is doing the Committee a service by setting out those points so clearly. I accept that the case for disclosing commission on conflict of interest grounds does not generally apply to a tied agent, but I assume that the Minister is deliberately leaving open the fact that the disclosure of commission as part of general information about the nature of an investment may still be necessary and would still apply to a tied agent selling investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. In answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, I sought to make it clear that the question of disclosure of general financial information relating to
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
a transaction needs to be looked at and is being looked at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am inviting the Minister to confirm is that the information that might be required to be disclosed under that head would, could, or should include information about commissions paid to tied agents on the sale of that investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may. That is one factor which will no doubt be looked at in the context of that exercise. But it is a different exercise and seeks to achieve a different objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is placing considerable reliance on the fact that when a tied agent is involved there is no evident conflict of interest such as may be implied when an independent intermediary is involved. Earlier in his speech I thought that the Minister was agreeing with the point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and by me that equivalence of treatment is an equally important basis on which to approach the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always hesitate to ask Ministers to say which of two principles to which they have referred is the more important, but it would help the Committee if the Minister confirmed that in emphasising his point about lack of conflict of interest, he was not overlooking his earlier, and welcome, statement about equivalence of treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to confirm that I am not overlooking that statement. I shall come shortly to specific points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and the hon. Member for Yeovil in support of their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought to show that the basic case for the difference in treatment is simple. The reason for disclosure of commission is conflict of interest. Such conflicts are acute for independent intermediaries, but not for company representatives. That is reflected in paragraph 6 of schedule 6 which refers to the fact that authorised persons, which includes their exempt representatives, must disclose the capacity in which they act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Supposing a company representative has two policies, each of which would be equally suitable for an investor, but one pays a higher rate of commission than the other, perhaps because the company wants to promote one policy as it has a higher rate of management charge, would there be a conflict of interest there for the company representative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be, but it would not be the sort of fundamental conflict that arises at the heart of the activities of the independent intermediary. I am well seized of the point and I shall return to it in the context of the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much more fundamental can a conflict be for a tied agent than that he should have a range of policies from only one company—because he is tied to that company alone—one of which offers £30 in commission and another of which offers £300 in commission? Surely that is a conflict of interest. Even if we forget equivalence of treatment, surely my hon. and learned Friend is being optimistic in the extreme to overlook the clear evidence of conflict of interest which my example shows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were I overlooking that conflict, the strictures explicit in my hon. Friend's question would be entirely justified. If my hon. Friend will bear with me I shall cover that point and his suggestion on how it can be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has got from his hon. Friends the feeling that I would have wished to express.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the arguments raised by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and other hon. Members, I direct the Minister's attention to the appendix to the Consumers' Association report, which gives a clear demonstration of the extraordinary difference in commission that can accrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that investment by a man of 44 or a woman of 48 on a sum assured of £25,000 can accrue £700 commission on a 15 years with-profit endowment. If the option is a 15-year protection-only policy, there is only £100 commission. There is a clear conflict of interest about which policy is most suitable for the investor and it can arise from products of the same company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I am seized of that point. Nevertheless, although it may be possible to identify a conflict of interest in that context, it is not fundamental to the activities of that salesman in the way in which the role of an intermediary can give rise to such conflict. There is a difference of principle but I accept that conflicts can also arise in the activities of company representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has been generous in giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I take my hon. and learned Friend's argument about the fundamental conflict of interest for an independent intermediary I made the same point myself—I fear that by concentrating on commission for independent intermediaries we may put them at a competitive disadvantage against products marketed direct by a company unless, at the same time, we make it clear that it is the total marketing costs of a product that are relevant, not merely the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept my hon. Friend's case that the total costs are relevant to the question. I have already said that there may be a case for disclosure of the total costs in a different context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On different grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, on different grounds. I do not accept that the total costs are relevant here in the way that my hon. Friend seeks to persuade me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to be helpful to the Minister because I suspect that he is alarming his hon. Friends unnecessarily by placing such reliance on the word "fundamental" when he qualifies this conflict of interest. It may be clearer to use the word "different" and to say that the disclosure of information about the investment as a whole must be dealt with on "different" grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only different but more pervasive. Perhaps that word will find more general approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two further points before I answer the specific questions of the supporters of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commission disclosure, which has assumed such enormous importance in the context of the insurance
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
industry, is not unique to that industry, although it seems to have been virtually ignored elsewhere. The distinction applies wherever people deal either as agent or principal and are remunerated by commission. Yet, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) pointed out, there has not been a chorus of protest from those who deal in or broke shares, unit trusts or other investments. If the rest of the financial industry is content, the insurance industry will have to show us why it is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commission has assumed an extraordinary importance, and the industry has tended to ignore other matters, though that is not true of our debate. There may need to be separate rules designed to show the economic value of investments, including surrender values and total marketing costs. Execution rules and the record-keeping system that will buttress them will be more important than the disclosure of commissions in ensuring that investors get appropriate advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some quarters have treated commissions disclosure as if it were designed to deal with all those problems, and criticised it because it fails to do so. It is not so designed. Its purpose is to mitigate a conflict of interest that arises, as I have explained, for independent intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was raised whether intermediaries should be polarised or whether there should be a middle ground. Reference was made to the MIBOC's proposals for polarisation and its consultations on the desirability of a middle ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with those who stressed the potential for confusion in allowing a middle ground. I should need a great deal of persuading that there should be exemptions from the basic approach of polarisation. I was surprised by the remarks of the hon. Member for Yeovil, although I should not have been. I should know by now that he and his party can never resist the temptation of the middle ground, however muddled and confused it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a middle ground would confuse investors and those who are interested in buying policies. Those who favour the middle ground will find it difficult to answer the points that the MIBOC said should be satisfied before that course could be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no magic remedy for the conflict that may arise for the company representative. I am sure that the MIBOC will consider carefully the contributions to the debate that have sharply highlighted that conflict. I commend to the MIBOC what Committee Members have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the suggestions put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. He went beyond the position that the British Insurance Brokers Association has adopted. Nevertheless, his suggestions merit serious investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that the disclosure of commission answers the problem adequately. The hon. Member for Dagenham, who said that he had been tipped towards that solution, recognised the difficulty that, because of the different way in which company representatives are remunerated, the commission may be relatively low. If someone compared a company representative with an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
independent intermediary, the result might be more disadvantageous to the intermediary than the present proposals envisage, although they are not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to MIBOC the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, and I accept that the matter requires attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend go a little further, and not merely tell MIBOC what he would like it to consider, but tell us how he intends to respond to the matter before Report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge my hon. and learned Friend's criticisms of the amendment. It is a difficult and grey area, and he has identified problems in the way the case has been advanced. On the other hand, the weight of feeling among Conservative Members, quite apart from points raised by other Committee members, suggest that it may be helpful to know whether he will consider the matter further before Report, and perhaps introduce an amendment to deal with the strong feelings among Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not keen to respond positively to my hon. Friend. Those matters can be dealt with best in conduct of business rules. No doubt comments made in Committee will be taken into account, and given careful consideration by the body entrusted with supervision of the conduct and regulation of the industry. I am not convinced that an amendment needs to be brought forward on Report, but I recognise the need to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Minister has gone further than we might have expected in supporting the thrust of my objective. I have the greatest regard for MIBOC, but let me put to the Minister the continued fear of some independent intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, despite his fine words and support, the Bill is enacted, without any of our suggestions fed into it, and MIBOC chose to ignore the Committee's advice, the considerable sense of injustice would make it difficult for the Bill to be as effective as we wish. If, by Report, MIBOC still does not sympathise with our views, which it will have read after this sitting, I hope that the Minister will not close his mind to introducing an appropriate amendment at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still reluctant to accede to those suggestions. MIBOC may not have drawn up its final rules by the Report stage, so it may not be possible to make a judgment then, but when the moment comes for the designated agency to be recognised it will be possible for views to be expressed about the rules that it will then have drawn up, and for recognition to be withheld. So the legislation is not the be all and end all of the matter, nor are the rules of MIBOC. Until the agency is designated and recognised, the final decision cannot be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar will appreciate that I have gone a long way to allay his fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's predicament. This is a difficult situation that requires careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
Am I not right in thinking that MIBOC, irrespective of the manner in which it is dealt with subsequently, may not exist when the Bill is enacted? If so, there is a serious question mark over how the matter would be conducted in the new organisation that would take over under clause 96.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the legislation gives an assurance that MIBOC will be designated, but any agency that wishes to assume responsibility for those matters will have to provide rules. The same considerations as I have just set out will apply, whether the agency is MIBOC, a unified agency including the successor of MIBOC or any other agency. The considerations will be identical; the need to satisfy the anxieties that have been expressed will remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. and learned Friend—I know that he is being helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that he is not interrupting me; I had sat down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If, as I understand, the Minister has sat down, I must call the next speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulties in which the Committee finds itself owe less to the Minister's inadequacy—he has explained his position carefully—than to the problems of dealing with this complex area by a provision which may not be the appropriate one under which to look at the question of disclosure of commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Minister's remarks on polarisation were extremely helpful and welcome to the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—to except for the adherent of the middle ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the disclosure of commissions, it was useful for the Minister to explain that clause 41 is not designed to draw distinctions between tied agents and independent intermediaries, or to have anything to do with disclosure of commissions in that context. It was designed to put tied agents in the same position, for all practical purposes of the Bill, as employees of companies, independent intermediaries, or whoever may employ them. That then leaves open a separate function, which the Minister has kindly agreed to discuss: what disclosure requirements should be imposed across the board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee now finds itself in difficulty because if we are to make rigid distinctions between different groups of people for example, between tied agents and independent intermediaries for the purpose of laying down disclosure of commission we may find that we end up far removed from the equivalence of treatment that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar was discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was helpful in explaining that because independent intermediaries fulfil a different function, as they sell advice as well as investments, it is perhaps natural that a different process of reasoning should be applied in identifying their disclosure requirements. The Minister stated that where independent intermediaries were required to disclose commissions—and there is no dispute over that requirement—that was to avoid a conflict of interest. That was helpful, and we are happy with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
The Minister said that clearly, that reasoning did not apply to tied agents; I believe that that also is fair, although he was pressed by his hon. Friends, who gave examples of other conflicts of interest that might arise even within the function of selling one range of one company's products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accepting all that he has said so far, there is a question yet to be resolved about the disclosure of requirements that should be applied to all authorised persons and their employees. I should like to press the Minister on whether that disclosure requirement for a tied agent employee, or any employee paid by commission, should now include a disclosure of the amount of commission that he receives for a sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is nothing to do with the conflict of interest that arises in the case of an independent intermediary. A wide range of information should be made available to a prospective customer, including many of the elements that the Minister, the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and my amendment No. 89 have tried to identify. As well as elements such as management costs and surrender values, should there not be a requirement that where a commission is made, the amount should be disclosed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the Minister has said, I imagine that he would not oppose that, and that he may expect the rules, when they are made, to cover that element. In that case, the Committee may say, "We are not so worried about the process of reasoning by which you reached that conclusion; we accept that there is a different process of reasoning because of the differences between the two categories of tied agent and independent intermediary. But we are anxious that there should be an equivalent requirement for the disclosure of commissions, subject to the safeguards necessary given the different roles that commission will play in the two different categories."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were saying that, I should be happy with it and it would also explain why amendment No. 76 may not be the appropriate mechanism to achieve it. But if the Minister is with me so far, and if he can say "Yes, in any body of rules governing disclosure generally, it would be expected that where commission sales were made, disclosure of commissions would be essential," that would leave only the major question on which he was pressed by his hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. I, too, would like to press the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is likely to be in the rules, it is important that the Committee be sure of that now. Like other members of the Committee, I have total confidence in SIB-MIBOC or whatever emerges—perhaps even a statutory commission. Nevertheless, some reference should be made somewhere—under clause 45 or schedule 6—to the fact that the rules will include disclosure requirements affecting management costs, surrender values, and commissions where paid. That is important, if only to allay widespread and deep-rooted fears within the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Yeovil, who may be hankering for something else, but I believe that if the Minister were to agree to that, the majority of Members on both sides of the Committee would be satisfied, notwithstanding the fact that he has arrived at his position by perfectly legitimate reasoning but by
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
dealing separately with tied agents and with independent intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot give us the assurance he will leave the Committee in a quandary. I fear that we shall be obliged to press amendment No. 89 to a Division, simply to ensure that the Government come forward with a measure on Report to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to accept that I am happy with most of what he said. I understand his reasonsing, but the Committee is entitled to ask for a provision in the Bill that will enable us to say to the industry, "We understand your problems and this is the guarantee that they will be dealt with."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by accepting that amendment No. 76 in the name of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and myself does not appear to have hit the target that we intended, albeit that our reasons were different. To that extent I am not anxious to press amendment No. 76 to a Division, but I continue to be a little concerned about the stance of my hon. and learned Friend the Parliament Under-Secretary. I concede that he has tried to be as helpful as he thinks possible but he appears to be saying that MIBOC will read the proceedings of the Committee, detect the feelings of hon. Members on both sides and move beyond the subjects to which it has turned its attention so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain disturbed that, by taking that view, we are looking at a long time scale after which MIBOC might, for whatever reason, be subject to the pressures of insurance companies taking a different line from that expressed in Committee. The pressure from those companies might be stronger than the pressure of speeches made in Committee. After the Bill has become law we shall have no opportunity of feeding in an alternative to amendment No. 76. We should face a situation which, as my hon. and learned Friend has conceded, would create substantial resentment in a sizeable body of honourable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6 carry the heading "Disclosure". There is a clear implication that disclosure by independent intermediaries is contemplated. I see no implication that there is scope for extending that requirement to include the possibility that we discussed earlier. It seems that we are examining the matter in an unfair and biased way and that we are not following through the equivalence of treatment that I advocated and which I thought that my hon. and learned Friend had accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand my hon. and learned Friend's reluctance to say that, at the very least, he would be prepared to consider on Report an amendment to clause 41, to clause 45 or to schedule 6—I care not where— showing that we were not relying solely on MIBOC or its successor, but that we were giving general guidance in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could receive at least a broad assurance from my hon. and learned Friend that that suggestion would not be wholly outside the range of possibilities, some hon. Members would be more content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that he cares not where we make the amendment, but clause 45 is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
only permissive. It says that these matters may be dealt with under the conduct of business rules, but schedule 6 sets out a series of requirements to the business rules. The Committee would probably wish to press amendment No. 104 to schedule 6 tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), if no undertaking had been given by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply trying to be as reasonable and cooperative as possible in seeking that undertaking from my hon. and learned Friend. If my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is correct in saying that the amendment should apply to schedule 6, no doubt my hon. and learned Friend will take that fact on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) because I have much sympathy with his line of argument, and I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) because I share his conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking about an amendment on Report it should be to schedule 6, to the scope of that disclosure requirement. I understand that he might not want to accept amendment No. 76 because it would amend clause 41 and is therefore inappropriate, but I hope that he will agree to amend schedule 6 to secure the objectives that we both want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister might give an indication en passant, but schedule 6 cannot be discussed now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has become a corporate speech involving many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already suggested how we might overcome the problem. A comparable declaration of commission would be difficult if not impossible. However, insurance companies could show periodically how and to what extent their tied representatives were remunerated for some policies, repeating the declaration only when the rates of commission changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a moderate suggestion. Will the Minister tell us whether he will contemplate an amendment to the legislation, instead of relying on MIBOC or its successor? Will he also say whether that would be a reasonable solution to the problem confronting insurance companies that employ tied agents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging and useful debate since I opened it nearly two hours ago. Initially, I and other Opposition Members found the Minister's response confusing. I recognised immediately the logic in this argument that amendment No. 76 might not be right. However, I am worried about his reluctance to include some element to reflect the strong feelings on both sides of the Committee that the area should be tightened up. I hope that he will reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a more logical place to encompass those views may be schedule 6, paragraphs 5 and 6. Our worries are covered by the schedule as drafted, but far too broadly. At the very least, some tightening up is necessary in that area, especially to reflect the idea of declaring commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point raised exclusively on the Conservative side, especially by the hon. Members for Brentwood
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), that the question of conflict of interest is just as likely to arise with a tied agent as with an independent agent. Commission could provoke a direct conflict of interest. The Minister was unusually unconvincing on that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accepted that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have accepted it, but he said that it was in some senses a minor issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will soon have the opportunity to clarify that point. A direct conflict of interest could arise. The declaration of commission may well have to be of a different sort, but it is necessary. If the Minister will assure us that he is prepared to allow amendments to schedule 6, paragraphs 5 and 6,I shall be satisfied. If not, I shall be compelled to press the amendment, if only to reflect the Committee's strength of opinion on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one area of disagreement where I find myself—albeit proudly—in a minority of one. It is on the argument that the middle ground should be rejected out of hand, or peremptorily, because it will make matters more confusing for the consumer, who will not know whether the tied agent is selling the host company's products or another company's products. It is irrelevant whether the consumer knows that, provided that there is an equivalence of safeguard to the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An independent intermediary can offer the prospective customer the most suitable product from the whole range of the market. If a tied agent is permitted no more than three or four additional agencies, it appears that there is an independent choice, but he is providing that choice over an extremely narrow range. Admittedly it is a wider range than his own company provides, but not much wider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point and is the flaw in the argument of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He wanted disclosure of commission to reveal the financial incentives involved in selling a limited range. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar makes the case that the non-exclusive tied agent can offer other products. However, they are being offered not on an independent basis, but on a tied basis. Nevertheless, the consumer is offered a much broader range of products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This practice is accepted in other areas. The only requirement should be that an agency is held by the host. The host company should take full responsibility for its own products and for those of other companies. That is not radically different from buying from one company an item of equipment which it fully guarantees, although it contains parts made by other companies. That may not be a precise analogy, but it is not inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister disagrees. He might like to consider some evidence from the Consumers' Association. It has made considerable study of what is best for the consumer. It might not always be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
right, but at least it is taking the consumers' point of view. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not have any evidence which would cause us to oppose company representatives offering products other than their host's, providing this is done by agencies held by hosts, that the status of the company representative is absolutely clear on all point-of-sale documentation, and that the host company takes full responsibility for its salesman, for its own products and for those of another company."</p></blockquote>
There is no worry about confusion; it is the safeguards that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the Minister's line we shall limit rather than widen the choice offered to the consumer. More importantly—here the Minister's attitude is contrary to the drift of the rest of the Government's policy—his line militates against new people coming into the market and small firms expanding by marketing the products of other companies. The result will be a situation that could, in the long term, be anti-competitive. Surely that is not the Minister's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that a possible solution is for companies—whether large or small—to employ their salesmen on the normal basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is a possibility and we may want to encourage it. However, that does not alter the fact that there are tied agents and they want to offer the broadest range of products. It does not matter whether the consumer knows precisely what is being offered; what matters is an equivalence of safegaurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my last point [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Hon. Members should realise, that this is only my second contribution to the debate. I intend to make my points in full. If the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) does not wish to sit this afternoon, perhaps he would not interrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of the comments that we have heard from Conservative Members has worried me slightly. They keep mentioning equivalence of treatment between sectors of the insurance industry. That is not my concern, and I do not believe that it should be the Committee's concern. We should deal primarily with equivalence of safeguard to the consumer. If that necessitates changes in the industry, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burtterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equivalence of treatment will be achieved if the Minister will agree to more complete disclosure. I am sure that I speak for most hon. Members when I ask the Minister for a specific undertaking that he will include those safeguards in the primary legislation, rather than in the rules. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) pointed out that clause 45 may not be the right place because it is a permissive clause. Perhaps the safeguards should be included in schedule 6, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon. Friend that undertaking, and I cannot pretend to do so. The matter will be dealt with in the rules. The Committee should think carefully before taking upon itself a rule-drafting role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
McCrindle). I said earlier that his solution to the problem of the conflict of interest that can arise for a company representative is, on the face of it, an attractive one. But it is very different to the solution suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). That illustrates the difficulty that can arise if the Committee assumes the rule-making role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to ask MIBOC to look at the point urgently and to recognise that it raises worries and needs to be dealt with. I hope that that request will give us before Report an idea of MIBOC's reaction. I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friends at least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Secretary of State transfers powers to a designated agency he must be satisfied about various matters. He need not transfer responsibility for some matters if he is not satisfied with the rules that the agency makes. He is accountable to Parliament for the way in which he exercises that power to transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask all Committee Members, but particularly my hon. Friends, to bear those matters in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to agree on the matter, as I am confident that the Minister is doing his best, in his own terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If MIBOC were unable or unwilling to make rules to govern the matter, would the Minister deal with it on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should wait and see what stage we have reached by Report. We should not decide in advance what to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave an equivocal reply to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I shall be more specific than the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that MIBOC looks at the matter in the light of the our debate because the Minister has drawn its urgent attention to it, but that it decides against moving in the direction that the great majority of Committee Members wish to take. As a parliamentarian, would the Minister, having heard the views of other Members of Parliament, feel that it was his duty to introduce an amendment himself, or would he find it impossible to fly in the face of rules made by MIBOC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is, "Neither". If MIBOC, having heard all that the Committee, including myself, has said, were to take the view that the point is impossible to cover I should be suprised, but I should want to consider its reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be unreasonable if I were to commit myself to a course of action without hearing the reasons that MIBOC may advance for the contrary view. I stop short of giving my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar that assurance, but I hope that he recognises that I have gone a long way towards meeting his worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only right that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister should listen to MIBOC. However, will he say that he will be satisfied with the agency's rules only if they ensure that a prospective investor will have all the information that he requires to decide between investment packages made available to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different point, as I explained, and MIBOC is looking at it in a different context. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
does not bear on the conflict that has been identified in the debate. I should like to wait to see what MIBOC proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, not the least of which is that the amendment would not begin to achieve what its supporters wish, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. He has gone a long way towards giving me the reassurances that I sought in moving amendment No. 76. I do not think that the Minister could give the same assurances in the broader terms of amendment No. 104, tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), but we must wait to see what the hon. Gentleman does about that. I am satisfied with the Minister's assurances, albeit given under pressure from his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the hon. Gentleman may be about to bring the debate to a close. I want to make it clear that while I, too, recognise that the Minister has moved a great distance, we reserve the right to vote on amendment No. 104 because we feel that that may secure the objective that many members of the Committee want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was sure that the hon. Gentleman would reserve that right, but in light of the Minister's assurance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 25, line 39, after "services", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or engaged by an authorised person under a contract of service".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. It has been put to me that the clause extends only to those who are directly employed as exempt representatives by companies and that there are many who, while to all intents and purposes being directly employed, are technically self-employed by some large insurance companies. While they are self-employed they generate all their income from the one source and so it is thought right to extend the clause to cover those individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
One such example is Abbey Life. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) in whose constituency the head office of Abbey Life is situated, may confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said. Because of my constituency interest I have an interest in the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause applies to those who have a contract for services. Such people would normally be the self-employed tied agents of an insurance company. Employees of a company would on the other hand have a contract of service. So, the effect of the amendment in some, sense is to allow an employee to be an exempt representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no point in making such a provision. Under the Bill employees of investment businesses do not have to be authorised in their own right; it is the business that has to be authorised. Once it is authorised, anything done by its employees is covered by the authorisation of the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that I have got my amendment completely the wrong way round. I have confused a contract for services with a contract of service. However, I think that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister has done the Commitee a service by clarifying the matter.
