	<p>amendment (a) to amendment No. 143, in line 2, after "dealing", insert "and competence".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment allows the professional organisations—solicitors, accountants, and so on—that will want to establish an independent area of activity to do so, if they
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide proper legal and professional safeguards for clients and their money and an independent disciplinary procedure for dealing with complaints against professional practitioners."</p></blockquote>
Having seen the Prime Minister on "Panorama" on Monday, I know that we shall form the next Government. Therefore, it becomes us to behave like statesmen—that is, to dress respectably and speak with brevity—so I shall be brief. Also, I must away to the Standing Committee on the Building Societies Bill, in which I have another chance to strike a blow at solicitors, on conveyancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to hold the Secretary of State and the SIB to the prospect that they have held out: that high standards will be demanded of the professional bodies that offer financial services. The SIB has said that it will require higher standards from the organisations than they provide for the discipline and control of their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is appropriate, as the organisations are often lax and self-interested in their disciplining of members. It is rare to get satisfaction in complaints against solicitors. If that dissatisfaction were to extend into investment advice and financial services, it would be disastrous for the consumer, whose interests we are anxious to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
Earlier in the week the Minister said that high standards would be demanded and that it would be convenient to allow the organisations to be independent, rather than regulate them in the way that we urged when we tried to strike out clause 15. The SIB has taken a similar position to his. Therefore, it behoves the Minister to accept the amendment, which requires the specifications of those standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative to regulation should not be a soft option. It should not be a conspiracy of solicitors, scratching each other's professional backs, while the accountants do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment simply lays down what the rules should be, how they should operate, and the standards that should be maintained. As the organisations involved have committed themselves to maintaining those standards, there should be no objection to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SIB suggested the modest amendment No. 143. It pointed out that the Bill requires SROs and investment exchanges to cooperate with the designated agency, so it is sensible to make a similar requirement for recognised professional bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). Its aims are similar to those of my amendment No. 117, which is perhaps less appropriately placed and less well drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the amendments focus on what many believe to be the weakness in the way in which professional bodies conduct their affairs, which is their apparent unwillingness to discipline their own members and impose appropriate penalties. The amendments are designed to show that these are matters to which the Secretary of State and the designated agency should pay attention. I hope that the Minister and the Committee will support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143, tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), is difficult to resist for the reasons that he expressed. In addition, the SIB wants the provision, and there is a similar provision in respect of other bodies brought within the ambit of the Bill. The SROs, investment exchanges, and so on, are subjected to the requirement. It seems perverse that it should not be imposed on a professional body about which there is much anxiety. I see that the Minister is nodding in concurrence, so he may be about to accept the amendment. The civil servants are also smiling encouragingly, which leads me to believe that we are making progress. On that happy note, I shall sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In amendment No. 175. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) seems to have singled out the Law Society for special attention. The Law Society has maintained high standards for decades, as have the Institute of Chartered Accountants and many other chartered bodies and professional organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby has conveniently overlooked compensation funds, and so on. He may recall a recent case which was taken up by the Law Society in which a complaint was made about costs. The client in that case was totally recompensed.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
That is what the provision is designed to achieve. Therefore, I repudiate everything that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has had to move fast to be able to recall anything. He is now in another Committee Room. Does not the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) agree that the Law Society has accepted that it has been deficient in the past by its acknowledgement that it needs to set up an independent complaints procedure? Might it not be helpful to specify such a procedure in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that there is an independent disciplinary procedure. It was set up on a statutory basis with an independent chairman and no criticism can be levelled at it. Therefore, there is no point to answer. I can only suggest that the hon. Gentleman should read the Act in question—and judging from the expression on his face, he agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same principle applies to amendment No. 143 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I have added the small amendment 	<i>(a)</i> which is consistent with other points that I have made. The Minister has kindly agreed to discuss the matter with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criterion of competence is necessary as an adjunct to the general standards that are to be required both of the SROs and the recognised professional bodies. I am sure that the chartered bodies and other professional bodies that will seek recognition will try to maintain these standards. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the provision in the amendment, or something similar should be included. There should also be a test of competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is important that it has the support of as many Committee members as possible. It covers a wider area than the amendments of the hon. Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and subsumes the points made in those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sharing of information is important, as the clarity and openness with which the professions and other organisations deal with such matters will be a litmus test of their readiness to pursue high standards of integrity and ensure that the clients and customers who use the services of their members are protected. The amendment is a useful adjunct to the provisions in clause 18 and I hope that it will find favour with my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief for fear that the Minister's transient mood of generosity, and benevolent smile on his face and on the faces of his civil servants, will pass quickly. We presume that the amendment of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has already received the ministerial grace. Conservative Members seem energetic and eager to leap to their feet to support it, which suggests that they are pushing at the door that they know to be open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is more specific. I wish that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
had been clearer about his reason for giving authorisation to certain recognised professional bodies rather than using direct registration with the SIB or an SRO. In the light of my comments on clause 15 and the serious public concern about the efficacy of the recognised professional bodies—notwithstanding the point made by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash)—it is important that the designated body ensures that the recognised professional bodies can impose penalties and carry out appropriate disciplinary procedures. That may be incorporated in the Bill. However, the safeguard proposed in amendment No. 117 is more explicit and will improve the Bill's standing with the outside world. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be as generous towards that amendment as he is towards the amendment of his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, of
course, important that investors who deal with members of recognised professional bodies are no less well protected than those who deal with other authorised persons. The special regime for recognised professional bodies is intended to make the best available use of existing regulatory structures, not to provide a soft option. Therefore, the clause provides that a professional body cannot be recognised unless its rules afford to investors at least equivalent protection to that afforded by or under chapter V.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recognised professional body will have to have rules on the same subjects as a recognised self-regulating organisation. Those rules will be measured against the rules laid down by the Secretary of State or designated agency, and the same equivalence test will be applied as that applied for recognised self-regulating organisations. Some of the Secretary of State's or designated agency's rules, including those on clients' money under clause 50, may apply directly to members of RPBs as well as to members of RSROs. If they do not apply, the RPB will have to have equivalent rules. Therefore, I do not believe that the first half of the amendment of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) would add anything to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment deals with a recognised professional body's disciplinary arrangements. They should include a significant independent element. The purpose of subsection (2)(c) is to secure a proper balance between the interests of members of RPBs and those of the public. It will be difficult to satisfy The Secretary of State or designated agency without a significant independent element in the disciplinary arrangements. I shall consider how that requirement for an independent element can be spelt out more clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to require the disciplinary procedures to be wholly independent would, in my view, go too far and tip the balance that has to be struck. It would also mean that the disciplinary procedures could not rely on the expertise of those who know the profession best, and it could lead to parallel investigations being made, one by the professional body and one under the independent disciplinary procedures, into closely related breaches of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests that a recognised professional body should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
required to have the power to impose penalties on its members. The clause already provides that a professional body cannot be recognised unless it satisfies the Secretary of State or designated agency that it has adequate arrangements for enforcing its rules and investigating complaints. In judging whether the arrangements are adequate, he or it will have to have regard to the sanctions which are available to the body if a member breaks the rules or refuses to cooperate in an investigation. If no such sanctions were available, the arrangements would be inadequate and the body would be unable to gain recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is, of course, essential that the different regulators of investment business should be able and willing to cooperate with each other and with regulators of other financial services, and to promote high standards of integrity and fair dealing. I accept entirely that recognised professional bodies as well as recognised self-regulating organisations should satisfy that criterion. I shall need to consider whether the provisions that we have made for recognised self-regulating organisations require any adaptation in their application to RPBs. But subject to that consideration, I undertake to propose at a subsequent stage an amendment to give effect to the principle underlying this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), I have had a note prepared on the interpretation of the phrase "fit and proper" and its relation to questions of competence. I propose to write to him within the next day or two on that subject and to circulate the letter to other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remarks are welcome and I hope that they presage an attitude that will survive throughout the Sitting. I am sure that his hon. Friends will accept the Minister's undertaking on the amendment of his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I am satisfied with what he said about my amendment and about the importance of appropriate sanctions as a criterion for recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), I believe that he too would have been pleased with the Minister's remarks on at least the second part of his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should have been pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. We look forward to receiving the Minister's proposals for the introduction of an independent element into the disciplinary procedures of a professional body. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby is not here to withdraw the amendment, we accept the Minister's assurances and we shall not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 14, line 3, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The Secretary of State may at any time, after consultation with the recognised professional body, require that body to amend, revoke or add to its rules in such manner as he may specify in order to secure compliance with the requirements of section 18(2) above or with the body's obligations under this Act".</p></blockquote>
The amendment returns to a theme on which the Minister earlier showed considerable flexibility and, indeed, undertook to accept the principle in respect of clause 12 that the Secretary of State or the designated agency should have the power, where appropriate, to impose a change in the rules on SROs without necessarily having to go to court to seek a compliance order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 88 seeks to provide a similar power over recognised professional bodies. The principle that has already been accepted by the Minister in respect of SROs is even stronger in the case of recognised professional bodies. In the debate on clauses 15 to 20, it has been generally agreed that the regulation of professional bodies and their members is likely to be fraught with even greater difficulties than the regulation of SROs and other authorised bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for closer control over the professional bodies is stronger than the need for the same control over the SROs. The SROs will have a rule book directed specifically towards carrying out investment business. However, the rule books of the professional bodies will be concerned mainly with other matters. Presumably, they will deal with investment business only "incidentally", which, I believe, is the word used in clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SIB becomes the designated agency, it should be able to put its finger on a rule in the rule book of the Law Society, or if a professional accountancy body, and to say, "That rule is not working properly. It should be changed in the interests of securing investor protection."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 gives SROs the power to go to court to seek a compliance order, but the Bill gives professtional bodies no such powers. Although the SIB had the residual power to seek a compliance order, it will be powerless to initiate any procedure which will make a change in a professional body's rule book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to distinguish between the two cases. But can he explain why there should be no power even to go to the court to secure a change in the rules? The case is strengthened further by clause 20(4), which makes it possible for the professional body to change its rules after it has been recognised. It can notify the Secretary of State, who has the nuclear deterrent of de-recognition. Difficulties may arise if the SIB recognises a body, but is unhappy with a subsequent rule change made by that body. Its only recourse would be to de-recognise that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest and sympathy to the Minister in earlier debates when he argued that there was a range of intermediate powers. But his arguments would be stronger and would carry more weight if he were to support the amendment and give the SIB that power. I can guess what the Minister's objection to the amendment will be. May I warn him in advance—perhaps foolishly—that if he argues along those lines, he will not succeed in convincing me? The Minister is desperate for help and if we had time, I would gladly write him a brief, as his civil servants have obviously failed to provide him with one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction that the Minister may point out between the professional body and the self-regulating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
organisation will not be sufficiently persuasive to warrant such a major difference in treatment. I urge him to accept the same principle in relation to professional bodies that he was obliged to concede in relation to SROs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reasons given by the hon Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) in favour of amendment No. 88 are the very reasons why the Committee should reject the amendment, although it has a superficial logic. He says that last week the Committee gave the SIB the power to intervene and change the rules of an SRO, so we should be consistent and give the SIB the same power in relation to an RPB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should reject that proposal, because there is a fundamental difference between an SRO and an RPB. An SRO's raison dêtre is to authorise and regulate investment business. Prospective RPBs regulate their members' business, both main and incidental. Where investment business is not incidental, firms will be subject to the main regime of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SIB were empowered to change the rules of a professional body, nearly every rule change that it required would have implications for non-investment business, because most of the relevant rules, including disciplinary rules, govern the totality of professional business. That would be wrong: the investment tail would be wagging the professional dog. It would be going too far to allow the SIB to intervene in the affairs of a professional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why I was inclined to support the changes made last week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did table the amendment, after all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean that I gave the matter consideration and brought it before the Committee. I said that I understood the position of the stock exchange, but that the National Association of Security Dealers and Investment Managers had been recognised for only two years and five other SROs were paper organisations with no practical experience, whereas, as my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said on Tuesday, the professional bodies that we are talking about have been regulating their members for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Trade and Industry has a longstanding interest in the standards and regulations of my institute—of which you are a very distinguished member, Sir Michael—and the other three accountancy bodies, because they are recognised under the Companies Act as eligible to conduct audits of limited liability companies.

Only this week the Table Office told me that I could not put down a Question about off-balance sheet finance and window dressing in company accounts because that was not the Department of Trade and Industry's responsibility. However, when the Table Office contacted the Department it discovered that the Department was interested in the matter. It has always taken a close interest in the institute's affairs because there has effectively been statutory backing for the institute's self-regulation for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another difficulty is that the institute is a chartered body, and any rules made by its members at a general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
meeting have to be approved by the Privy Council. Therefore, the proposal of the hon. Member for Dagenham would enable the SIB to intervene in matters that were properly the concern of the Privy Council. That seems a strange constitutional proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have been concentrating on discipline, among other matters, but the institute already has comprehensive disciplinary arrangements. An investigation committee looks into complaints about members, and it already has two non-accountant members. Anyone would think from our debates that no lay members are involved in disciplinary matters now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases that need to be investigated further are taken to a disciplinary committee which also has two non-accountant members. It can exclude a member; suspend a member; withdraw a practising certificate from a member; declare a member ineligible for a practising certificate and censure or reprimand a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, there is already a wide range of penalties open to the disciplinary committee, and its verdicts and sentences are published, and where a member is excluded, suspended or deprived of his practising certificate, a notice is placed in local papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investigation committee can in certain circumstances refer cases of public interest to the joint disciplinary body. That is a good example of interest taken in the past by the DTI. The scheme was set up in 1976 when Mr Edmund Dell was Secretary of State for Trade. He called in the accountants and said that he was not satisfied with the disciplinary arrangements, and the scheme was set up to deal with substantial cases involving the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lay members on all the committees, and it could also be argued that there are lay members on the council. A large proportion of the members of the council are not in practice but in industry, and they are customers using the services of the members, which gives them a differenct view of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of SIB wrote to me yesterday and said that there are two possible ways in which the problem of discipline can be tackled. He is naturally anxious that we should get the arrangements right. On Tuesday we debated the need to import a degree of scale as regards the investment business undertaken by professional firms and we discussed whether there should be a quantitive limit. There appears to be a difference of opinion between the Department's lawyers and SIB's lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable and learned Friend the Under-Secretary said that there is no difficulty because although the Bill contains no reference to scale, it will be possible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
for SIB to introduce a rule involving scale, but apparently SIB has been legally advised that the reverse is the case. That worries me because—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction between laying down a general rule which would include a reference to scale in all circumstances—which may not be permissible within the Bill—and laying down a rule saying that, because of the particular circumstances of a particular professional body, it is necessary and desirable to introduce a rule involving a reference to scale. I suggest that that would be permissible under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, but it would put the matter beyond doubt if we were able to refer in the Bill to the scale of investment business. I said that on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of SIB's first approach to clauses 15 to 20 is to impose additional requirements. He refers to amendment No. 143, which I am glad that my hon. and learned Friend had accepted in principle. The chairman also refers to amendment No. 88. His second approach is to limit the amount of investment business that can be done by a member of a profession in reliance on his body's recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what my hon. and learned Friend said on Tuesday, it seems, unfortunately, that he is not prepared to accept the second approach and therefore the chairman feels that he must support the need for a change along the lines of amendment No. 88.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that, in those circumstances, the preferable course would be to introduce an absolute quantitative limit on the amount of investment business that could be undertaken incidentally by a professional firm. That would be infinitely preferable to adopting this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene in the debate, but the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) have convinced me that it is necessary to do so. He started with some ingenuity by trying to oppose the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), but his earlier remarks were not convincing, and some of his later comments were irrelevant to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether the rules of a recognised professional body will be adequate to protect investors, and what the SIB can do, if it believes that they are inadequate. The extent to which good enforcement and disciplinary arrangements may exist within the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and other professional bodies, does not seem to be strictly relevant to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investors, especially the Aunt Agatha type of investor, may not know whether their investment advice comes from, or the management of their portfolio is conducted by, an SRO member, who has to comply with SRO rules, or whether advice is provided by someone who can do that simply by virtue of his membership of a recognised professional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dangers of confusion will increase if, as I understand is likely, some of the larger professional firms decide to separate their investment business, and put it into a separate unit, which will then be authorised directly by an SRO, while the rest of the profession continues in another part of the firm. On the other hand, other smaller firms in the same profession will not adopt that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
There will be, therefore, considerable ignorance among investors about whether the investment protection applies to them, although they think they are entitled to it under the Bill, because of the SRO's tight rules, and the SIB's insistence on maintaining adquate SRO rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of recognised professional bodies failing to apply sufficiently stringent rules may not be great, but it would be difficult to reject the amendment, given the emphasis placed by my honourable and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in our previous sitting on the equivalence of treatment between the recognised professional bodies and the self-regulating organisations. On looking at Tuesday's 	<i>Hansard,</i> I see that the Minister said that there is consistency and parity of treatment. If that is to be so, I hope that the amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hoped to catch your eye, Sir Michael, before the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) spoke, but I am glad that I listened to him first. He made an important and telling series of points, to which I hope the Minister listened carefully, given that they were raised by one of his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say, gently and with respect, that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) made a speech which may be an object lesson in caution for other Committee members about taking on the brief for an organisation, which makes points with which one substantially disagrees. No doubt he will deny that, but, as he has made powerful points about investor protection in respect of previous clauses, his latest comments appear to run counter to that, both in tone and content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, he was saying that it was unimportant that we did not have the power, contained in the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), because that portion of the investment business was incidental in relation to the totality of the work of the recognised professional bodies. Yet the hon. Gentleman has argued cogently and passionately that "incidental" was an unacceptable word, and sought to include the idea of scale. Those two ideas appear to be contradictory. The hon. Gentleman seemed to be taking refuge behind a provision that he previously wished to amend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that needs to be addressed by the Opposition and my honourable and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is whether it is proposed to give SIB the power to change a rule that would alter the arrangements for the business of professional people which had nothing to do with investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because it takes me to my next point. I was unconvinced by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that any actions here would have a knock-on consequence in other business covered by the recognised professional body. The amendment is clear and would affect only those portions of those bodies' operations with implications under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some portions of the operations may have implications for other areas covered by the recognised professional bodies but surely the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
Beaconsfield is not holding pat on that. If changes are required to the overall rules of a recognised professional body to provide equivalence of safeguard and sanction for small investors on that portion of their incidental business covered by the Bill, those changes must be made. It would be wrong for a recognised professional body to say, "We won't do that because it will have deleterious and unfortunate effects in other areas of our business." That argument is not convincing, especially as the issue is covered in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers another important aspect and says
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the recognised professional body".</p></blockquote>
There is an opportunity for the Minister, for SIB or for the designated body to listen to suggestions from the recognised professional bodies and, if necessary, to implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have referred many times to the possibility that the Secretary of State may not have to use that power, and I expect that we shall repeat the argument. It is a reserve power which, in the last analysis, is available to the Secretary of State. The Minister has already conceded that reserve powers can, on occasion, be useful and necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dagenham and for Suffolk, South hit the nail on the head. The recognised professional bodies with which we are dealing direct their primary energies not towards the protection of investors but towards other areas. I imply no sense of corruption or dereliction of duty, but if those bodies' attention is not primarily concentrated on the protection of investors they may overlook the dangers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it may be difficult to draw watertight distinctions between the activities of recognised professional bodies that are obviously concerned with investor protection and their other activities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, solicitors in the City of London find it difficult to get adequate insurance. Their partnerships have unlimited liability. The Law Society resists the suggestion that solicitors should be able to incorporate, so they are taxed up to the limit and find it impossible to build up reserves. There could be some precarious-ness and it might be appropriate for SIB, the other agencies or the Department responsible for investor protection to have the right to encourage recognised professional bodies, if not to pressurise them, to deal with such problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which adds considerably to the argument that I and other hon. Members have sought to advance. The Minister has the chance to overcome resistance by the Law Society to a useful and helpful change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have touched on my next remarks, but it is worth emphasising. In addition to the fact that recognised professional bodies will direct most of their energies to activities other than the protection of investors, they also have what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) described as their trade
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
union function. The representational functions of recognised professional bodies may cut across or work against their desire to protect the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, which would put into practice the important principle of equivalence of treatment. The amendment would provide a reserve power, and the Minister has conceded that he is willing to accept reserve powers on occasions. Its effect can only be good. I shall not understand if the Minister resists it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A balance should be struck in what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) rightly pointed out the difference between the professional bodies and the SROs. We must be careful about accepting amendments with such wide terms that they would enable rule changes that are not related to the Bill or, if they are, that are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made a compelling case for the equivalent treatment of the SROs and the recognised professional bodies, and for reassuring those who deal with the members of an RPB or with investment adviser that they have equivalent protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 gives the Secretary of State, and eventually the SIB, the power to ensure that the standards of protection are adequate before he grants recognition to a professional body. Therefore, the issue is changes in the rules after recognition, rather than inadequacy because if a professional body's rules were inadequate, he would not grant recognition in the first place, and he is unlikely to impose a change in the rules to allow him to recognise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the amendment, because the members of a recognised professional body will not be able to provide the same sort of investment advice as the members of an SRO. Members of a recognised professional body will be able to provide investment advice that is incidental to their professional remit. Members of an SRO will be able to provide the full range of investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate about scale suggests that the Secretary of State and the SIB should have a reserve power to impose a change in the scale of a profession's investment activities, if rule changes were proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how to find a middle way. The hon. Member for Dagenham has sought to do so in his amendment, which confines the imposition of rule changes to the requirements of clause 18(2) and the general objects of the Bill. It would not allow the Secretary of State to change rules on general matters, only on investment matters. However, even that would be too wide for a recognised professional body, as its members would not be able to provide the full range of investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary should consider the case for a reserved power to change rules, if it can be limited to scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the room, as he is now, hon. Members appear, like Jason's teeth, out of the ground to raise questions about almost everything under the sun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as a member of the Law Society, although not on behalf of it. I sympathise with the amendment, which has considerable merit. Management consultancies and similar practices have tended to emerge from within professional firms. Questions involving investment will be asked of the management consultances which will, and already do, give advice. The same conflicts of interest and so on arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have conceded clause 12 and the amendments suggested by SIB. Amendment No. 88 occupies a similar position in relation to these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield spoke of the Privy Council, but I must point out that professional bodies do have sponsoring Departments, and furthermore in a well-known House of Lords case involving the Pharmaceutical Society, Lord Reid in 1967 made it clear that it is the first duty of a chartered body to have regard to the public interest rather than to professional remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems incongruous that in the Bill we are giving to professional bodies treatment that is materially different from that given to SROs, I await with great interest the reply of my hon. and learned Friend, as I feel that there are grounds for accepting at least the spirit of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) spoke of incorporation and the Law Society; the Law Society has been considering that issue for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of abiding regret to me that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was unwiling to disclose the basis of his guess about the line I would take on the amendment. I can neither congratulate him on his foresight nor chide him for lack of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am equally sad that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), who declared to the Committee that he would await my reply with great interest, departed from his intention in a way that is only too characteristic of his party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I then invite the Minister to congratulate me on my prudence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to congratulate any hon. Member on his prudence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal that the Secretary of State or designated agency should in certain circumstances have the power to direct a recognised professional body to change its rules is a natural extension of the similar proposal in respect of SROs, which we debated on 13 February. However, I believe that rather different considerations apply in the case of a recognised professional body and that is why the Bill contains no powers over RPBs analogues to those in clauses 12 and 13 over recognised SROs. In the case of a recognised SRO, as a number of hon. Members have observed, complete de-recognition would have such wide-ranging consequences that it might not be a credible threat to an organisation which was failing to keep up standards, and, where the failing was relatively minor, de-recognition would be an overreaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
Intermediate sanctions are therefore necessary, and we had a very interesting debate on the form those intermediate sanctions should take. In the case of RPBs, however, the consequences of de-recognition are less wide-ranging. If members of a de-recognised body wish to carry on investment business incidentally to their profession, they will, like anyone else, be able to join a recognised SRO or seek direct authorisation. The withdrawal of an RPB's recognition would not therefore leave a hole in the self-regulatory system, as it would in the case of a recognised SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, therefore, feel that there is a less pressing need for intermediate sanctions, since withdrawal of recognition is in the case of RPBs a perfectly credible threat. I believe that this a powerful argument, and that a perfectly workable regime could be established without intermediate sanctions such as compliance orders, restriction of business directions and the rule-changing envisaged in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the light of the views that have been expressed on both sides I am willing to consider again whether the Bill should include those intermediate sanctions, particularly the sanctions sought in the amendment. I should warn the Committee that there could be substantial practical problems, as some of the rules of professional bodies are embodied in legislation and some of the rules of others are subject to the approval of the Privy Council, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. But if the practical problems can be overcome I see no objections of principle to introducing provision of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. I was much encouraged by some of the speeches and interventions from Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) fairly conceded that the SIB Supports the amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the SIB's position. As I understood it, the SIB would have much preferred the Government to have accepted the amendment I moved on Tuesday, on the need for scale. That would be a more satisfactory method, because one of the matters that has not so far been considered is that there is not the same incentive for a professional body to secure recognition in the first place. An SRO would be nothing without recognition, but a professional body can say to its members, "You 17,000 must all register directly with the SIB". No doubt that is one aspect that the SIB has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I gave way to the hon. Gentleman I did not mean to give him an opportunity to make his speech again. However, we know the Minister's attitude on the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I withdraw my compliment to the hon. Gentleman for his fairness in conceding, as I thought he had done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the SIB is—to me, and I suspect to the hon. Gentleman, also—on the record as supporting the amendments, given that this is the provision on which the board now has to rely. I state that, because it is important that the Committee knows SIB's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what the hon. Gentleman said was not very persuasive. Like the remarks of some of his hon. Friends it smacked of special pleading, and effectively he was saying that it will be difficult to incorporate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
professional bodies into the structure of authorisation in the Bill. That is common ground between us, but surely that makes it all the more important to find some method of ensuring that, or investment business, there is adequate power in the hands of the SIB to provide a proper level of investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it would be very undesirable to see the SIB blundering in like a bull in a china shop, starting to make in the rule books of the Law Society and other professional bodies, radical changes that have nothing to do with investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendment is drafted in such a way as to restrict the power to make changes in the rules that are relevant to the purposes for which the professional body was recognised. How could such a circumscribed power be resisted, particularly in the light of the Minister's concession on the need for the power in relation to SROs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). One of his arguments on the other side of the balance sheet is the incidental, and therefore limited nature of investment business to be authorised under the Bill. I hope that we are talking of a limited amount, but within that limit the investor will require the same level of protection as he would if he were dealing with a member of an SRO or someone directly authorised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to clarify the issue. I contest what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has just said. We were told earlier that, for example, a solicitor or an accountant could advise that a sum of money should be invested in a life assurance policy, but, if he were to go beyond that and recommend a specific policy or house, he would be straying outside the remit. In the latter case, he would be entitled to much greater and more extensive protection than in the former case. The two issues are, therefore, qualitatively different, and the necessary regime of protection should also be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can agree with the hon. Gentleman. If an authorised member of a recognised professional body is carrying out investment business, whether incidental or otherwise, which requires authorisation within the Bill, it implies that, for the limited amount of investment business that he does, he should provide the same level of investor protection as any other authorised person, in respect of that business. I accept that the scale is different—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a limited type, not amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the type is different, but the level of investor protection should be the same. I hope that Committee members agree with me about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister pinned his reply on the essentially negative argument—that the nuclear deterrent of de-recognition, in the case of a recognised professional body, was not quite so nuclear as it would be in the case of an SRO. I was persuaded by what the Minister had to say about that, but that does not tell us whether it might also be worthwhile to have the further intermediate power, which was recognised as necessary in the case of SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
Many of the arguments about scale addressed by the Minister to his hon. Friend the Member for Beacon-sfield would carry more weight, if the amendment were accepted. No doubt the hon. Gentleman and I agree about that. The SIB would then have a range of powers, enabling it to control the scale of authorisation under the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has recognised the potential value of the amendment. He did not go far enough when he said that he would consider the matter. We are always looking for the language of undertaking, so perhaps the Minister could be a little more specific in saying what he would foresee as the outcome of his consideration. He pointed to some of the practical problems raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. If those problems prove to be surmountable, will something be done to meet the point? If so, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should consider a possible anomaly in the Bill. Departments of insurance companies which manage the investments of life departments are not required to be members of an SRO. That is a fairly large anomaly, as there are millions of life assurance policy holders for whom that type of investment is of great personal importance. As I understand it, such funds under management total £100 billion or more, so it is a significant issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment No. 195, to delete clause 21, and related amendments Nos. 196 to 214 were tabled with a view to eliminating that anomaly. I apologise to the Committee for resorting to such an elaborate and circuitious means of making one point. The fact that you, Sir Michael, have not selected those amendments on technical grounds, which I understand, shows that it is a difficult point to gouge out of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is of the utmost simplicity; we are discussing whether to keep the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper, the anomoly that I have mentioned was paralleled by another: the exclusion of self-managed pension funds form the obligation to be a member of an SRO. By the time the Bill was published, that second anomaly had disappeared. However, the anomaly in relation to insurance companies persists, and that appears to be a departure from the principle— properly articulated in the Bill—of equivalance of treatment.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
morning, we emphasised the validity and importance of that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, investment business that may be carried on by insurance companies consistent with section 16 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 falls into three categories: the sale of life assurance, the management of life funds, and the management of pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we shall wish to debate issues connected with the sale of life assurance later. My anxiety now is that the management of life funds would be outside the scheme of regulation under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 17 of schedule 1 excludes a person dealing for his own account, and technically the life funds of insurance companies belong to the insurance companies themselves. Therefore, although, in reality, the insurance life companies are managing other people's money just as much as unit trust managers are, in a legal sense they are managing their own money. That is not satisfactory and I would argue that the principle of equivalence of treatment, or the level playing field, as accepted in the White Paper, requires that the economic reality be recognised and that the investment management of life funds be brought within the framework of investor protection and self-regulation embodied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21 confers the status of "authorised person" for investor protection purposes on insurance companeis authorised under the 1982 Act. Schedule 8 reinforces that clause. It precludes an insurance company using the principal means provided by the Bill— membership of a recognised SRO, or direct authorisation by the Secretary of State or a designated agency—to become an "authorised person".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps those provisions should be deleted to recast the Bill and meet my point. One way of achieving that would be to delete clause 21 and adopt amendments Nos. 196 to 214. However, it may not be necessary for insurance companies to be authorised twice, and I accept that to delete clause 21 may entail an excessively cumbrous procedure whereby insurance companies that have already been authorised by the Department of Trade and Industry for their main activities would have to seek further authorisation from a designated agency or an SRO. We may be able to amend the legislation sufficiently in clause 110 and schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that most major insurance companies are forming investment management subsidiaries, which they intend voluntarily to submit to SROs. The majority of insurance companies and the people working in them are unquestionably of the utmost probity and competence. However, there are millions of policy holders, and it is essential that we achieve a comprehensive and effective regulatory system. Unless the Bill is amended, a minority of insurance companies may remain outside a voluntary scheme of participation in SROs and I am worried that there may be some rogues among them who would be tempted to abuse their freedom from regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, insurance companies should be brought fully within the system in respect of the managment of life funds. I suspect that that objective could be achieved if the Department of Trade and Industry required membership of an SRO by life fund departments or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
subsidiaries of insurance companies as a condition of authorisation for those companies to carry out insurance business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I state a problem, but I am not dogmatic about its solution. However, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would explain why he has not made provision to bring the management of life funds within the broad scheme of regulation. Will he undertake to discover how they can be included in the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only briefly. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) did the Committee a service by initiating a short debate on clause 21. I have no strong view one way or the other, but my hon. Friend made several valid points which at the very least deserve a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two further questions. First, the veil of respectability appears to be drawn across insurance companies by reference to the Insurance Companies Act 1982, which updated the Insurance Companies Act 1974 and the Insurance Companies Act 1980. The basic reason for those Acts was the demise in unfortunate circumstances of insurance companies such as Vehicle and General, and Fire, Auto and Marine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1975 Act sought to underpin insurance companies' resources to make it impossible for others to act as those companies did. Nothing in the original did. Nothing in the original Act and little in the subsequent Acts had much to do with life assurance or with the management of investment funds. I wonder whether the Government are wise in hiding behind the 1982 Act, whose origin relates to matters far removed from those in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the management of funds, it is critical that the investor can judge the respective merits of a very wide range of insurance companies. I have said before that there can be a substantial difference between the best-performing and worst-performing companies over a period of 25 years. The investor has a right to look to the investment expertise that lies at the heart of the Bill's objectives. By eliminating that necessity for insurance companies, we may be going too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon has done the Committee a service by focusing on clause 21 and I look forward with interest to the justification of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the exclusion of companies under the Insurance Companies Act 1982.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) and for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) for enabling the Committee to discuss such an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon was right to say that we are talking about sums in excess of £100 billion for the investment funds of insurance companies. In fact, the figure is about £125 billion. By contrast, the funds available to unit trusts are approximately £16 billion, and it is on that £16 billion that we shall focus quite a lot of attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar was also right to remind the Committee that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
there was a raft of legislation to ensure that the prudential supervision of insurance companies was tightened up where gaps were noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar will bear with me and delay the discussion on quality of advice until clause 1 and 42. I doubt whether any member of the Committee will have failed to notice that a significant volume of correspondence is building up on the issue. It may help if we draw breath for a moment. It looks as though we shall have a few more days to synthesise our views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon raised a key issue, about the principle in clause 21 of the authorisation and regulation insurance companies. We should keep clause 21; its deletion—which I understand was my hon. Friend's original intention—would cause considerable difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, we shall deal with who shall and who shall not be authorised for investment business—and how—when we discuss clause 110 and schedule 8. Therefore, I shall not comment on the detail of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall say a little about whether the Bill should regulate the investment management of the long-term funds of insurance companies. Those are funds accumulated from the companies' long-term business, usually life insurance. They are, broadly, the resources that policy holders have transferred to the insurance companies to invest for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not cover the management and investment of those funds. Legally the funds belong to the companies, so they are managing their own assets. Policyholders' claims on the funds are not based on ownership of the assets, but on their contracts with the companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 17 of schedule 1 excludes the management of one's own funds from the definition of investment business, so it is not a regulated activity under the Bill. That is sensible. It would be curious if the Bill were to require someone who is both the investment manager and the investor to become an authorised business to manage investment on his own behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon rightly asked whether the strict logic of that provision is in keeping with the ethos of the Bill. Clause 150 makes occupational pension schemes an exception to that principle. Its effect will be to require the authorisation of the person who manages the investment of an occupational pension scheme, although, in strict legal terms, the trustees of occupational pension schemes own the assets and are, therefore, investing their own funds. The Government believe that that exception should be made to protect pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for making an exception of the long-term funds of insurance companies, too. Therefore, we have sought the views of insurance companies and friendly societies, for which similar considerations apply. We have not concluded those discussions, but hope to do so by the time that we reach clause 110— which at the present rate of progress should be at Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
I believe that there was assent in the Committee to the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon. My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that some insurance companies keep their investment management at arm's length in subsidiaries, which will be caught by the Bill's provisions. However, insurance companies hold a vast amount of funding that the Bill does not provide for, a fact which should be taken into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend appreciate that, although some people will have their pension provision arranged through a pension policy, which will be handled as my hon. Friend described and be within the ambit of the Bill, other people will have their pensions provided by a pure life assurance policy, which, under the clause, will not be within the ambit of the Bill? I do not ask the Minister to respond to that immediately, but perhaps he will consider an apparent inconsistency—if his pension is governed by rules, and mine is not, that may create problems when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely one of the issues that we wish to address in the debate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing it out here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have started, but not yet concluded, consultations on whether management by insurance companies of their long-term funds should be brought within the Bill. I hope that those consultations will soon be completed, and we shall therefore be able to come to clear conclusions in good time for discussion in this Committee of the relevant provisions of the Bill. We hope to have that further data available for use in Committee before we reach clause 110. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon, who took a well-contrived opportunity, will be reassured that we are dealing seriously with the issue he has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to the Minister if I say a few brief words on what is clearly an important matter; we are grateful to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) for having raised it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the debate carefully and share the general anxiety that the management of funds of that magnitude should not too easily escape the ambit of the Bill, on the purely technical ground that, in law, they are funds which belong to those managing them. As the Minister concedes, that is especially relevant to occupational pensions funds, where that technicality has been swept aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also considerable weight in the point raised by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle), that—in the light of changes perhaps already visible in this respect, and which are indeed being debated down the Corridor—there will be a switch from one type of provision for pensions to another type, which will become an even more pressing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister has taken account of the problem, and is involved in consultations. We shall await with interest the outcome of those consultations, when he perhaps brings forward changes to later provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his ready recognition of the validity and importance of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
the issue, and I welcome the consultations that are taking place with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hard to imagine that there would be good reasons for persisting with the current strict interpretation in respect of insurance companies, when an exception has been made for pension schemes. I hope that the Minister will come to a positive conclusion, and will be able to recast the Bill to respond to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister hopes to have full responses to his consultations, and to have absorbed them, before we come to clause 110. I agree with him that, given the pace of our proceedings, that is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I cannot be 100 per cent satisfied with the provisional nature of his anticipation of tackling the problem only when we come to clause 110, because the deletion of clause 21 would provide an avenue to achieve the outcome that I am seeking, though, in the parlance that we have adopted in Committee, that is a nuclear deterrent, and I would prefer to avoid using that. Perhaps the Minister will understand if I decline to support the retention of clause 21.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief point to raise on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsections (1)	<i>(b)</i> and (2)	<i>(b)</i> the clause authorises friendly societies but not their branches. The friendly societies liaison committee has sent me a well-balanced letter explaining that as branch friendly societies are not mere agents of their order, but have independent funds on which insurance business is directly written, failure to authorise them directly under the Bill would extend the area of control by the central body over them and has implications for their autonomy. The letter continues that although there may be advantages in such controls, branch societies are sensitive about their automony and do not wish to lose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The friendly societies liaison committee says that it is in touch with Ministers, who have suggested their willingness to look again at the question if the friendly societies come out clearly in favour of one solution rather than another. Is the Minister in touch with the friendly societies and, if the societies come forward later with a strong case for changing the provision, will he consider it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that there will be automatic authorisation of branches.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the effect of the clause drafted, but the friendly societies liaison committee says that although it sees the merit of that route, their branches, which are jealous of their autonomy, may say, "No, we would prefer to be authorised in our own right, and not be subject to the overall control of the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached the part of the Bill that deals with persons who are authorised directly by the Secretary of State or by the designated agency— SIB. The clause specifies the details to be submitted by an applicant applying for authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add two new subsections suggested by SIB. The amendment is designed to disapply the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which would otherwise enable spent convictions to be concealed. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 Exceptions Order 1975 contains exceptions for dealers in securities, insurance companies and authorised unit trusts. The amendment would extend those exceptions and the scope of regulation generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SIB is seriously concerned that if such an extension is not made in the terms proposed, the operation of the new system will be severely impaired. Because of SIB's concern I thought it might table the amendment, and to seek the response of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 144 of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). My amendment No. 129 was an earlier, and less expert, attempt to achieve the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's arguments again drew attention to the fact that SIB is anxious for the provision. Such an exemption already exists in respect of recognised and registered security dealers, therefore, what is proposed here is that as the scope for regulation is extended, so should the scope of the exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is important that members of this Committee, and the House, should consider the light in which the Act was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally, great anxiety was felt that individuals who had served their terms retained the slur of their convictions over them for the rest of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the concessions in that Act were hard-won civil rights, achieved by many people and organisations concerned with the rehabilitation of offenders— particularly the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. While the Bill is concerned to provide investor protection, we should not easily lend our names to amendments such as these without having compelling reasons for making such an exemption. There have been exemptions and if a further exemption is made here, it will be easy to make a case for exemptions in many other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary will frame his reply in a way that shows respect for the Act, which many hon. Members hold in high regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I agree with the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) who speaks with some passion and a great deal of ability on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a retrograde step indeed to accept the amendment, not because the remarks of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) do not have the force, but because it could produce precisely the result that the hon. Member for Chichester described. This is a matter of principle, and it would be wrong to breach it here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I find it amusing that a member of the party to which the hon. Member for Chichester belongs should be taking a more libertarian and protective line on civil liberties and rights than some Labour Members. I found it odd to hear the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think why the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is surprised that Conservative Members should be more solicitous of civil and human rights than Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our brief debate has illustrated the difficulties that can arise in attempting to reconcile different principles that are well based and expressed with vigour on all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find myself in my accustomed role of trying to pursue a middle course and to reconcile differing views. I shall be introducing provisions concerning the disapplication of the the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act later in the proceedings on the Bill. However, I shall describe at some length the kind of disapplication that I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend that regulators, be they the Secretary of State, an agency, a recognised SRO or professional body—and authorised businesses themselves—will be able to secure and use information about spent convictions, free of the constraints of the Rehabilitation of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
Offenders Act, in certain defined circumstances. I propose to focus this disapplication on the directors, managers and controllers of investment businesses, with similar provisions for partnerships and sole traders, in line with the exemption in the Banking Act 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disapplication will apply to those seeking authorisation, as well as to authorised businesses. Disclosure of all past offences will have to be made to the regulator, be it the Secretary of State or the agency, a recognised SRO, a recognised professional body or any of the other bodies responsible for the authorisation of businesses under the Bill. Authorised businesses or those seeking authorisation will also be able to question those who are, or who are seeking to become, their director, controller and manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to confine the disapplication to the senior management of investment businesses in line with the Banking Act precedent. A wider disapplication would deprive too many individuals of their rights under the 1974 Act and would, in many cases, oblige the disclosure of offences which have no bearing on the individual's fitness to work in an investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I shall propose that the only spent offences that will be disclosable will be those that relate to offences of dishonesty, which includes fraud, and offences under legislation such as the Companies Act 1985, or the Insolvency Act 1985, which is related to the Bill. That will ensure that only past offences relevant to the fitness and properness of a person to be involved with an authorised business should be disclosable to a regulator or authorised business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the provision is still under consideration, so I cannot give the Committee a precise indication of the kind of offences which could be covered, but, in drawing up a precise definition, the points that have been made this morning will be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that in many cases the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 itself specifies quite lengthy periods before a past conviction is deemed spent; before that time is up, all offences will have to be disclosed. That Act also provides that offences which result in a custodial sentence in excess of 30 months are never deemed spent. So the Act itself contains protection to ensure that those with a recent criminal record are obliged to disclose it, even without any disapplication of the sort that I have just described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drawing up the disapplication, I have attempted to strike a balance between the concern felt in the City and in the Committee for regulators to have proper information about applicants for authorisation and the aims of Parliament in passing the 1974 Act when it was intended to enable those offenders who have remained free of any conviction for a specified period to start afresh and not be penalised by having to admit to past convictions, especially when seeking employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been recognised that specific exemptions are necessary for those involved in the management of certain financial institutions in order to prevent fraud, but the exemption should not be so widely drawn that it deprives many of their rights under the 1974 Act. My proposal will seek to focus the disapplication on persons and offences relevant to the exercise of regulatory powers under the Bill and the protection of investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn in the light of those assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal of my hon. and learned Friend would in one sense widen the existing exceptions order, but in another sense, narrow it.

I assume that my hon. and learned Friend is proposing its extension to all authorised investment businesses, but he has told us that the exception would be confined to directors, controllers and managers. That would mean that life insurance salesman who have a record of dishonesty would be able to obtain authorisation. Further, he proposes to confine it to dishonesty, so anyone with a serious crime of violence on their record would not be included.

	<br><blockquote><p>(1A) If he is satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to carry on the kind of investment business described in the application, the Secretary of State may, instead of granting the application, direct the applicant to apply for membership of a recognised self-regulatory organisation and, as a condition of such a direction, prohibit the applicant from joining another such organisation or other recognised self-regulatory organisations.".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, which addresses the problem that the Securities and Investments Board had identified. It is worried that it may be inundated by applications under the provisions that allow for direct authorisation of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow the SIB to direct "fit and proper" persons to apply for membership of the appropriate self-regulating organisation, rather than for direct authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not get it right, but if there were a large number of applications for direct authorisation, the whole structure of authorisation could be jammed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a question of numbers. There is the problem of the sort of bodies that might seek direct authorisation. The Minister will be aware that several potential financial conglomerates would have to join several SROs, if they chose to seek authorisation in that way, because they conduct a wide range of investment business. That could give them problems of overlapping jurisdiction, including the jurisdiction of the Bank of England, and the allocation of skilled staff to keep an eye on the affairs of several SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not oversympathetic to those problems. However, I am worried, because a few of those conglomerates intend to escape some of the problems by applying for direct authorisation. The Opposition would be unhappy with that outcome. I expect the Minister would be, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should not be a major area, whether for numbers or for the importance of the bodies involved, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
which authorisation is primarily direct. The amendment would give the Secretary of State, the designated agency, or the SIB the power to nip that in the bud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued—I shall anticipate the Minister's objections—that it would be odd if the designated agency were to turn away an applicant and send him to knock on the door of an SRO, which could not be guaranteed to accept his application. However, the designated agency will first ascertain that the applicant is a fit and proper person, for whom it would be appropriate to join an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be merit in having such a provision in the Bill, but there are also arguments against it, which I expect that the Minister will elaborate. I look forward to hearing his views on how we should deal with potential problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 6 February the Committee considered a connected amendment, which would have enabled the Secretary of State or the designated agency to prohibit a business that had been authorised by one SRO from joining another. I explained that if a businees were to apply for authorisation to more than one regulator, each regulator would take into account all its investment business in coming to a decision. The applications would not be considered in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some of my hon. Friends, conscious of the SIB's policy of encouraging authorisation by SRO membership, see virtue in the amendment, although they have not risen in support of it. They think the amendment could be used to direct business towards an appropriate SRO, and away from direct authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain the unfortunate consequences of such a move. The possibility of direct authorisation needs to be kept open. At present, all those businesses refused admission by an SRO may apply for authorisation by the Secretary of State or the agency. They may believe that rejection by the SRO was unreasonable, or simply caused because the SRO did not think that the applicant's ivnestment business fitted appropriately with the activities regulated by the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to apply for direct authorisation is a valuable safeguard against SROs acting as cosy clubs, and keeping out, for example, a new competitor by denying him SRO membership. If the application to the Secretary of State or the designated agency fails, there is the possibility of an appeal to the independent tribunal, for which the Bill provides. That process ensures that every applicant is given a fair opportunity to demonstrate his fitness and properness, so the option of direct authorisation is important for those who believe that they are being unfairly excluded from an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives the Secretary of State or the agency an option, and provides for the agency, not the SRO, to judge whether the applicant in question is "fit and proper". That would have implications for the character of SROs. If the Secretary of State or the agency can direct a business to join a specified SRO, it follows that the SRO must be directed to admit it to membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the points foreshadowed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)—or at least a variant of it. That will radically change the character
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
of the SRO. If SROs no longer have control over who constitutes their membership, can they really be said to be self-regulating? If, on the other hand—as the hon. Gentleman pointed out—they retain the power to reject applicants for admission, there is a serious difficulty in the concept of the designated agency or the Secretary of State simply turning away people, and directing them to an SRO, which may reject their application for membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the investment businesses that are so directed? A business will have its reasons for not joining an SRO. Some may be trivial, such as a personality clash with the chairman of an SRO. Others may be more important: a business may believe that an SRO's charges are excessive for the service which it provides, or that its business does not fit conveniently into the activities regulated by the SRO. As use of the proposed power would be discretionary, which of those reasons would be judged so inadequate that they should be overruled? The power of direction clearly gives the agency a power to make invidious choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I foresee difficulty in allowing the agency to ignore the wishes of the business concerned, and perhaps of the SRO also, and to insist on SRO regulation. It would turn the SROs involved into more statutory bodies than is envisaged in the Bill
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of my comments should be taken as being at o variance with SIB's policy of encouraging SRO membership as the best means for most businesses to obtain authorisation, but encouragement should not turn into compulsion. Direct authorisation needs to be available, not least as a safety valve, and, if the Secretary of State or the agency were to have the power of direction, which the hon. Gentleman's amendment would provide, it would undermine the choice presently available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the comments of my honourable and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, as some of the reasoning behind the advocacy of the amendment was compelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it would still be SIB's policy to encourage businesses to apply in the first instance to the SRO, rather than directly to the SIB, but I am not clear how that will be done. Will the Minister simply say that he hopes that businesses will apply in the first instance to an SRO? Are there any measures to encourage people to go to the SRO, rather than directly to the SIB? Is the Minister content to leave matters as they are? What happens if, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests, a large number of those conglomerates go directly to the SIB? Will the Minister tell us whether, if someone applies in the first instance to an SRO for authorisation, and is turned down, he can then apply to the SIB instead? The SIB is, in effect, a sort of court of appeal, or a second attempt to obtain authorisation. If they apply to SIB in the first instance, and the application is turned down, can they then apply to the SRO, or does the former negate the possibility of the latter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, it would be preferable for many reasons that businesses be actively encouraged, if not statutorily required, to apply in the first instance to the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that there may, sadly, be a reason for giving the right of direct application because the reasons
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
for turning down an application by an SRO may be unacceptable—for example that a person running a business does not quite fit in—the applicant therefore deserves a right of appeal, the power should not be treated simply as an option open to businesses and should be rather more of a second preference than was suggested by the remarks of my honourable and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fortified by the remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) who again picked up some of my arguments and elaborated upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply betrayed a misapprehension, although I am not clear whether it was deliberate, about the precise effect of the amendment. There is nothing in the amendment to extinguish the possibility of direct authorisation. All that the amendment would do is give the designated agency or the Secretary of State the power to direct an applicant in that direction. For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman has given, and which I have also tried to set out, that may be an important reserve power for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister rightly said, it is odd that the SIB can say, "No, you go and join an SRO," because that puts a certain obligation on the SRO to accept the application, but the amendment does not say that, nor need it have that effect. All that the amendment requires is that the applicant should apply for membership. If the SRO has substantial grounds for refusing, it is free to do so. However, in practice, in most cases where the applicant has passed the "fit and proper" test, the SRO would see no objection to accepting the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand—questions the Minister suggested—there were grounds for SRO refusing the application, it would be free to do that, too. That would create a new situation, and perhaps the amendment should deal with that situation, giving the right to reapply to the SIB in the event of being turned down by the SRO. However, it is implicit in the structure that an applicant who has passed the test will be authorised either by pursuing the recommendations of SIB and obtaining membership of an SRO, or, by coming back to SIB and saying, "For reasons over which I have no control, the SRO turned me down".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In either case, SIB should have the power to head off what could be a worrying development. I have a dreadful feeling that if we do not insert some provision to this effect the Minister may live to regret the day that we failed to take the opportunity. Has the hon. and learned Gentleman some comment to make?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As so often with regulatory structures, people will find ways round this and it may be seized on by certain applicants, or groups of applicants, as a means of avoiding problems inherent in the structure in the Bill. I counsel the Minister to accept our advice, and to think carefully before rejecting the power, which might prove very useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister any idea of the likely configuration of the membership of the various organisations? I realise that we do not yet know the precise nature of the SROs, but has the Minister done any research to establish the numbers that might seek direct authorisation rather than authorisation through an SRO? His answer might help our consideration of the amendment. Such research would enable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
outside organisations to make representations to us during the coming weeks about the problems that they envisage if we proceed without the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) the answer that he seeks. I fear that his question was a little unrealistic even by his standards. As we do not yet know the final configuration of the SROs, we cannot possibly say at this stage how many investment businesses may seek direct authorisation. I cannot respond to the hon. Gentleman's request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has not dealt with the practical difficulty at the heart of his amendment. I appreciate that he is not suggesting that direct authorisation should be ruled out of court completely. However, to give the designated agency the power to direct an investment business to make application for authorisation from a particular SRO, when it remained within the power of that SRO to reject the application would create an odd and unsatisfactory situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more desirable for the designated agency to have no power to direct, although it will of course have powers of encouragement. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) asked how encouragement would be affected. If the designated agency were approached by a particular investment business seeking direct authorisation, it would be perfectly feasible for the designated agency to encourage the investment business to make application to an SRO in the first instance if the agency felt that authorisation from an SRO would be more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what one would expect to happen. I foresee no difficulty with that system but I foresee great practical difficulty in the suggestion in the amendment, which is both undesirable and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester asked me to deal with a further specific question, but there may have been more. I hope that he will forgive me if I fail to recollect them. My hon. Friend asked about the order in which application could be made and whether it would be possible to apply for direct authorisation first and then follow up with an application to an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why that should not be done. It would be a slightly curious method because one would expect application to be made in the first instance to an SRO and then, if that application were refused, for an application to be made for direct authorisation. It is the refusal of direct authorisation that gives rise to the right of appeal to the tribunal. If the process is viewed as a logical sequence, initial application to an SRO would appear to be the normal procedure. The direct answer to my hon. Friend's question is that there is nothing to prevent application from being made for direct authorisation in the first instance. Then the designated agency could, if it wished, use its powers of encouragement to suggest that in the circumstances it was preferable for application for authorisation to be made in the first instance to an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no answer to the practical difficulty which lies at the heart of the amendment and which was recognised by the hon. Member for Dagenham. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said there was nothing to prevent the SIB informally encouraging a business to approach the SRO, although the business has no obligation to do so. For example, some companies will decide on the cheapest way of securing authorisation to conduct their business. The costs and obligations imposed on businesses by SROs could exceed those of direct authorisation or subscription to the rules of the SIB. Therefore, the financial advantages and the prospect of operating under rules less stringent than those of the SRO could prompt people to try to obtain authorisation from the SIB— despite pressure from the SIB to do otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is modest and would not drive a coach and horses through the Bill's structure. If the hon. Member for Dagenham were to press the amendment to a Division, I should have to consider which way to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another reason for rejecting the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester referred to two regulatory features which might lead someone in investment business to prefer direct authorisation, to the SRO's authorisation. Both the cost and the stringency of the regulatory regime are within the control of the designated agency, and it would be up to the agency to ensure that its authorisation were more attractive than that of the SRO. Therefore, the remedy for my hon. Friend's worries lies within the designated agency's powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I suggested some of the considerations that might lead an investment business to seek direct authorisation rather than authorisation from the SRO, I identified fears or objections which might be difficult to justify objectively. For example, there might be a personality clash between an investment business and the SRO's chairman. Neither the hon. Member for Dagenham nor my hon. Friend have addressed that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the designated agency is to have the power to direct someone to seek authorisation from the SRO it would be for the agency to assess the reasonableness, or otherwise, of the objection of that investment business to seeking authorisation from an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Dagenham are inviting the designated agency to decide whether a personality clash, for example, is a sufficient reason to justify the refusal of the investment business to seek authorisation from the SRO. If we explore those circumstances, we see how difficult it would be to exercise a power such as that contained in the amendment. I therefore advise the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, and perhaps not surprisingly, I was more persuaded by the remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester, than by those of the Minister. I do not understand why he believed that the application of a test of reasonableness by the SIB would be beyond its competence or jurisdiction. Given that it has, quite rightly, to exercise a range of powers, I do not understand why that responsibility should be as peculiar as the Minister thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
Although the Minister pointed out some practical problems that might arise if the amendment were incorporated in the Bill, the hon. Member for Chichester and I have shown that those problems are less serious than they appear, and have eminently sensible solutions. However, the Minister has not offered any solution to the major problem with which the amendment deals. For various reasons—some have already been mentioned, but others may be unforeseeable at this stage—groups of people, either in concert or otherwise, may decide that they want direct authorisation. If that were to happen, on any scale, either in terms of numbers or the size and importance of applicants, a coach and horses could be driven through the structures provided by the Bill. We must try to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB would not wish to be saddled with the responsibility of dealing with thousands of applications for direct authorisation. Given that that is common ground, the amendment simply seeks for the SIB or designated agency to have the power to deal with the problem, if it arises. The Minister has not told us how he would deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a proper ventilation of the issues. I was encouraged by the support of Conservative Members, and do not wish to detain the Committee in its deliberations. I hope that the Minister will consult his colleagues and the SIB, and reconsider the problem, because, in view of my conversations with some of the major financial conglomerates, it appears to be a real problem which we must face. It will be very welcome if he does reconsider the matter, and brings forward new proposals on Report, although he is giving no assurances about that. Opposition Members certainly intend to raise the matter again on Report, and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 16, line 33, after "and", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that any change in the partners is notified within one month of the change to the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is prompted by the provision in clause 26(6), to the effect that an authorisation to a partnership is granted in the name of the partnership, and subsists notwithstanding any change in the membership of the partnership. At first sight, that appears to be a means by which an unscrupulous person could obtain authorisation. For example, he may persuade his colleagues, who have a pristine reputation to set up a partnership. They would obtain authorisation, take him in as a partner, and then leave the partnership, leaving him in possession of an authorised business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is subject to the provisions of clause 27, which allows the Secretary of State to suspend or withdraw that authorisation. The Minister may be able to set my fears at rest easily, but I can see no mechanism by which there is an obligation to bring to the Secretary of State's attention such changes in the partnership as might induce him to use his powers under clause 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question may be met somewhere in the Bill—for example, among the provisions about keeping a register—and if it is, I shall be happy to sit down promptly. I should be grateful for the Minister's help. If there is no such provision, I hope that the Minister will look favourably at the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to the notification regulations under clause 48, which would enable a notification requirement to be imposed. The Secretary of State or the agency could make regulations about the notification of specified events and I strongly expect changes in a partnership to be covered by those regulations. Failure to comply could leave the partnership open to sanctions, as would other breaches of rules and regulations in the Bill. I need not go through the whole range of sanctions available.

I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Member for Dagenham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend agree that if a partnership ceased to contain its original members, because of the joint and several nature of the partnership, its activities would be covered as far as the investor was concerned under partnership law?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contents of clause 26(6) are in stark contrast to those of clause 15(3), which covers recognised professional bodies. My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has undertaken to look at the matter again, but there is clearly a considerable difference between the provisions of clause 15(3) and those of 26(6). I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will consider it appropriate to give further consideration to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) for that well-taken point. I fear that I did not listen carefully enought to the remarks of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). However, if I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, I must say that Opposition Members would be unwilling to rely on the general principles of partnership law when the Bill provided for a special regime of regulation and remedies for the carrying out of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were prepared to rely on the general law—for example, criminal law—we should not bother with the Bill. That is why it is important to deal with the problem to which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West drew attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out the power to make regulations under clause 48, which would cover the problem. The difficulty is that we have no absolute assurance that such rules will be made, although I took what the Minister said as being very close to such an assurance.

However, it is right to hold a separate debate on these provisions because, in the light of the debate on clause 26, we concede the possibility that people will obtain authorisation under the guise of a partnership and retain that authorisation even though the composition of the partnership may change substantially.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister has set his face against similar amendments, but I believe that the SIB thinks this a desirable change. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will look more kindly upon this amendment, given the precise circumstances of this form of authorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our debate last Thursday on this general subject showed that there is not much difference between us in principle. However, the change of wording proposed in the amendments will make little difference in practice and will not enhance investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proposed decision by the Secretary of State or designated agency to withhold or revoke a licence can be referred by the business for investigation by the tribunal. An SRO or investment exchange does not have a similar ability. The tribunal will investigate and consider the reasons for the proposed suspension or withdrawal, to ensure that no authorised person is deprived of his livelihood without due cause. Therefore, the Secretary of State or the agency would need a reason for proposing to withdraw or suspend an authorisation. The amendment would not free their hands to act where the present wording would prevent them, so the nuance in the proposed new wording becomes insignificant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members should also bear in mind that powers of intervention are available to the Secretary of State or the agency to use with immediate effect against directly authorised businesses if the Secretary of State or the agency thinks it desirable for the protection of investors—perhaps while a decision about withdrawal of authorisation is being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
