<p><i>Amendment proposed</i>'[this day]. No. 221. in page 25. line 28, before Trie' insert '(1)'.—[Mr. Ashdown.]</p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering amendment No. 222. in page 25. line 32, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The exemption granted by subsection (I) of this section shall cease to have effect one year after this section comes into force, unless prior thereto an order for its continuance shall have been made by the Secretary of State and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Sir Michael. May I refer to the fact that today SIB and MIBOC have published their proposals for the regulation of individuals. They recommend specific powers to operate a system of registration for individuals engaged in investment business. If we are to have such a system, the Government must introduce new clauses to provide for it. It is important, because of the controversial nature of those proposals, that the Committee should have an opportunity to consider them. Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will say when the Government hope to respond to that document, and whether they agree with the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, MIBOC has issued such a consultation document, and has asked for responses within a month. Clearly, as my hon. Friend says, if the proposals were to be accepted, new clauses would be necessary, but would not be brought forward during that consultation period, because everyone should have a reasonable opportunity to consider the implications. If the Government decide to reject the proposals, they will not introduce new clauses, but other Committee members can do so if they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to rule that that is not a point of order for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the discourtesy of arriving in Committee a few minutes late. I was seeking to intervene in a statement in the House, and was the last hon. Member to be called.<br><br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the amendment, which I regard as fundamentally important, even if other Committee members do not. We have sought to tell the Government, "We are prepared to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
wait, and to give you the benefit of the doubt." I have described that as the triumph of hope over experience, but we are prepared to take that risk.<br><br>
We are prepared to wait to see the results of the Government's intention to inquire into Lloyd's, but that inquiry should be related to what needs to be done, and how. rather than to whether it should be done. The placing of Lloyd's willy-nilly at this point under the Bill would overburden the SIB's resources, and be too much to ask in the first year. We ask only that the House has an opportunity to review the matter in a year's time, in the light of the Neill inquiry and the Government's actions.<br><br>
It is a vital issue, which should have occupied more of the Committee's time. I am sorry that the Committee appears to be divided between Conservative Members, who say that in no circumstances should Lloyd's be included in the Bill, and Opposition Members, who say that in every circumstance it should be included.<br><br>
I wish to press the amendments to a vote, even if I am the only hon. Member to support them. It is a right, sensible and logical case.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) on his persistence and determination to be first into the fray on the question of Lloyd's. I marvelled at the long hours spent burning the midnight oil in drafting amendments at the tremendous intellectual effort required to understand why they were not succeeding. No doubt earnest hours of consultation were spent with those in the Liberal party who specialise in such matters. Finally, with your indulgence. Sir Michael, great efforts were made to have the matter debated in this slightly curious form.<br><br>
However, my admiration was tempered slightly when I realised that all those mighty labours eventually produced what appeared to be a Liberal mouse. I voted for the amendment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Liberal mice are sometimes preferable to nothing, but we now come to the real meat on the menu, which is the fundamental question of whether Lloyd's should be excluded from the Bill. The question is now whether Lloyd's should be within the Bill, but whether clause 40 should exclude it.<br><br>
By common consent that is a major issue. It has caused the Committee difficulty because of the Minister's involvement with Lloyd's. I am glad that he has at least partially accepted the force of our arguments on conflict of interests and on this occasion, as was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
foreshadowed by press reports, he has deemed it prudent to hand over responsibility at least for this clause to his hon. Friend.<br><br>
Lloyd's is, and has been for some time, a matter of fundamental concern to all those who watch the City and who are concerned about its future health and good reputation. The problem that both the Government and Lloyd's face is that Lloyd's is, par excellence, the instance of self-regulation. It is a living example which has operated over many years of how self-regulation performs and what results its produces without any element of outside supervision. As Aneurin Bevan said, "We don't need to look into the crystal ball when we can read the book." The book is there; we know what happens when a body becomes so introspective and incestuous in relations between the regulators and the regulated that outside standards have no opportunity of breaking in. We have seen at Lloyd's on so many occasions that practices that become the vehicle for fraud are embraced also by those who are supposed to be regulating those operations.<br><br>
In the light of the recent and the longer history of Lloyd's I want to state without fear of contradiction in the Committee that everybody agrees that Lloyd's must be properly regulated. If it is not, the reputation of Lloyd's and of the City will be affected. So we have a common interest in making sure that Lloyd's puts its house in order and is properly regulated under whatever rules are provided.<br><br>
Lloyd's should certainly be regulated but should it be regulated under the Bill? A disappointing aspect of the speech of the hon. Member for Yeovil was his willingness to slide off that issue and to abandon the robustness promised by his zeal in wishing to attack the issue. In the end it proved that he did not wish Lloyd's to be brought under the Bill in any direct sense but that he wanted a deferment of the process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to compliment me earlier about burning the midnight oil. I accuse him of inadequate research. He had only to stay and listen to my speech on Second Reading or to read <i>Hansard</i> if, as I suspect, he was not in the Chamber, to know that I have taken this stance from the start. This is no matter for the sort of insult that the hon. Gentleman used.<br><br>
More importantly, the hon. Gentleman now seems to be saying that this is a week option. Will he explain how giving the House of Commons the right to take a decision in a year's time is a weak option. Does the hon. Gentleman consider that the institutions of the House are weak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that I was present for his speech on Second Reading and that I listened to it with great attention. As I tried to explain earlier, my problem was that I was so impressed by his zeal and determination to tackle the issue of Lloyd's before anyone else that I wrongly imagined—I accept the hon. Gentleman's rebuke—that aim of his frenetic activity was to do something tough about Lloyd's.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me why I regarded his amendment as a soft option. I place great faith in the ability of Parliament to deal with such issues. I believe that if one is invited to consider an issue and has plenty
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
of time to reach a conclusion, it is better to act on that conclusion than to transfer responsibility to another body, defer action for a year or to decide later. That is not part of the Liberal tradition and even the Minister referred to "on one hand" and "on the other". Those are the expected Liberal traditions and I was clearly wrong to imagine for a moment that the hon. Gentleman was about to depart from that long history of ambivalance and delay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It sounds to me as though we are debating the last amendment. May we now get to the clause stand part debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I was present throughout the debate on Second Reading, although I could not contribute to it, and I can corroborate the fact that the hon. Member for Dagenham was present when the hon Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) spoke. Indeed, it was notable that, once the hon. Member for Yeovil had spoken, he was absent for much of the subsequent debate. But that is a characteristic of the Liberal party.<br><br>
Perhaps I can explain the amendment. The hon. Member for Yeovil—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing any amendment. We are discussing clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to address my remarks entirely to clause stand part.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yeovil also took a robust public stance on cruise missiles for about a year before he was sat on by the right honourable Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen). Then he backed down completely. Perhaps the fact that we have been talking about a year during the clause stand part debate may be explained by the previous experience of the hon. Member for Yeovil.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I should be grateful to the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) for that intervention. I do not detect the hand of the right honourable Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) in this issue, although it may be there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree that we must read clause 41 with clause 43, and that clause 41 contains a power to bring in an exclusion of the exemption within the year, which the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subject to the slight correction that we are discussing clause 40,1 accept the observation of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).<br><br>
Let us return immediately to the main theme of the debate. Before the hon. Member for Yeovil intervened I was saying that it was widely accepted that Lloyd's should be regulated.</span></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may dispose of the intervention of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) as both ridiculous and inaccurate. The hon. Member has precisely no knowledge of these matters whatever.<br><br>
The central point is that we can make a decision once we have the facts to hand, and the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
Dagenham accused me of being wishy-washy. The facts that will be revealed by the Neill inquiry should be taken into account, especially by anyone in the Committee who has not made up his mind firmly on the issue—which is unlikely. It is typical of the arrogance of the Labour party that it should make up its mind and decide that it knows all the facts without being prepared to take into account this important inquiry which may delve deeper even than the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about running the risk of further strictures from the hon. Member for Yeovil, but his latest intervention shows that he is not just wishy-washy but naive as well in relation to the inquiry.<br><br>
We all accept that Lloyd's should be properly regulated, so the central question is why it should be brought within the Bill. Much of the concern about City fraud and how institutions operate has its genesis within Lloyd's, so it is perverse to proceed to legislate on City institutions after lengthy preparation to provide investor protection, eliminate fraud or provide remedies for fraud, while deliberately excluding Lloyd's. That is the point that the Government must answer.<br><br>
It is argued that there is some onus on Opposition Members to make the case for bringing Lloyd's within the Bill. However, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary gave a full, accurate and helpful statement that explained clearly in what respects certain activities of Lloyd's constituted investment business for the purposes of schedule 1.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have described three main activities which fall within the scope of schedule 1: the management on a collective basis by managing agents of the affairs of Lloyd's syndicates; the process of giving advice and assistance to members and potential members of Lloyd's by members' agents; and the investment management of members' insurance funds, usually carried out by underwriting agents."— <i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 4 February 1986; c. 121.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister identified three activities at Lloyd's of some substance which consituted investment business which would fall within the ambit of schedule 1.<br><br>
As the Bill is defined, Lloyd's is included. The hon. Member for Yeovil has muddied this water with his amendments at times, so let us make it clear that it is not the insurance business of Lloyd's but the investment business as defined by the Minister that we wish to bring within the Bill. The onus is not on us to say why it should be in the Bill. The onus will be on the Minister to explain why it is considered necessary to exclude that investment business from the Bill. It is worth asking what other types of investment business have been excluded in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all accept that there have been serious frauds at Lloyd's, but would the hon. Gentleman accept that they have not been connected with that investment business? The frauds were related to premiums and reinsurance businesses. Therefore, why is he worried about that investment business when it has produced none of the deficiencies that he fears?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by the intervention of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). I know that he means to be helpful and he would not take up a position without having thought it through.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
However, it is not on the insurance side that the problems have arisen; no Lloyd's policyholder has ever lost out. I am happy to concede that point. The problems have arisen on the investment side; it is the investors who have lost out. The management of the collective investment scheme has been remiss. It is not just a question of fraud; it is a question whether those involved are fit and proper people and whether conduct of business rules should apply.<br><br>
A PCW name has written to me about his member's agent, who introduced him to Lloyd's and persuaded him to cough up the money, and who has just been convicted of trading in heroin and generally has a very bad reputation.<br><br>
Such investment activity, which undoubtedly falls within the Bill in principle, ought to be subject to the rules that regulate investment business. It is not a question of insurance or of policyholders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the hon. Gentleman on that? It seems to me that we have fraud in premiums and on the reinsurance market, but not in the investment business as it is defined in the Bill. Surely it is not the money that has been invested on behalf of members but the premiums that have been misappropriated and spirited away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the point made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West I believe that he may be misled by the word "reinsurance". We are talking about the management of a collective investment scheme by underwriting agents for investors. Clearly, that involves the process of reinsurance, preferred syndicates, and so on, and comes within the general definition of investment business that the Minister made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) accept that he is referring to investment and management of laymen's money which, in all cases, is subject to trust? The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer—of great distinction, of course—and I am sure that he well understands what it means when the question is raised of the moneys being held subject to trust. I should like him to pursue that point because I should like to learn a little from the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the law of trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) pays me a compliment, and I should reveal immediately that I used to teach the law of trusts. He has rightly drawn my attention to the fact that trust law would, of course, apply. But it applies to every fiduciary relationship that we are considering under the Bill and if we, or the Government, or anybody else believed for a moment that the law of trusts was sufficient to regulate the City, we should not be bothered with the Bill.<br><br>
The fact is that we are bothered with the Bill, and the law of trusts is not good enough either for investment managers generally, or for those who manage investments for Lloyd's members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, will the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) tell me precisely how the deeds, which are approved by Lloyd's, are defective in relation to the point on trust? That is a central question, and I insist that he answers it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is totally mistaken on that point. The specific provisions of trustees are hardly relevant to the general principles of trust law and the general willingness of the courts to enforce fiduciary duties. I can say no more than that. If that were all that were required, we should not be concerned with legislation for a regulatory structure. We all know that it is not sufficient—that is why we are regulating.<br><br>
I do not believe that the hon. Members for Bournemouth, West and for Stafford (Mr. Cash) were trying to be unhelpful in their interventions, but, wriggle as they may, it is not I who argues that Lloyd's underwriters are engaged in investment business that falls within the Bill—it is the Minister himself. Again, I invite Government Members to read columns 120 to about 123 of our proceedings. They will see from the remarks of their ministerial colleague that the specific exclusion in clause 40 is the only thing that keeps Lloyd's out of the Bill. We are entitled to ask, "Why exclude Lloyd's?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not answered my point. Perhaps I was asking too much of him. I shall put another question to him.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, under the arrangements the investments must be chosen with regard to security, which is monitored by the solvency test, to ensure that liquid funds are always available to pay claims?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is failing to take the general point. The law of trusts, the trust deeds, and the rules of Lloyd's may say what they like—I am sure that they say exactly what the hon. Gentleman has said—but they are not sufficient.<br><br>
The rules of trust law are not sufficient for any of the other relations that the Bill will regulate. If that is the case, why do the Government think that they are sufficient for Lloyd's?<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene yet again to offer me an answer, I shall give way yet again. If he has not got an answer, I shall proceed to what I think are the arguments for exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The frauds in Lloyd's have been committed for the misappropriation of premium income. It has been spirted away to other parts of the world through complicated devices and procedures. However, will the hon Gentleman not accept that in principle it is no different from the theft by a clerk in a building society of money that has been paid into the society? If in principle it is pure theft of income, no amount of regulation would have prevented it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is trying to help, and that he believes the point that he has made. It is difficult to draw a line for the limit of the definition of investment business.<br><br>
I refer the hon. Gentleman not to what I have said, but to what his Minister has said. The Minister identified, on the record, three of the activities of the underwriting agents of Lloyd's as investment business. That is beyond dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am not making my point clear to the hon. Gentleman. The Minister did

give a definition of investment business that included some activities of Lloyd's underwriters. However, the frauds and scandals do not arise from those activities; they arise from simple theft.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to read in <i>Hansard</i> what his hon. and learned Friend the Minister said, he would see that the management of premium income on behalf of investors is investment business. It is the management of a collective investment scheme under the terms of clause 67. That may surprise the hon. Gentleman, but it is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the management of the money, but the theft of the money that has been the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The theft of the money is the mismanagement of the money. Management includes all the possible activities in relation to the money, and theft and fraud at one extreme are among those activities. That is precisely what we are trying to stop. I hope that we agree on that, and can continue, having established the broad principle that Lloyd's underwriters are involved in important investment business. That investment business would normally fall within the ambit of the Bill yet it is specifically excluded.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
Why should that be so? Various arguments have been advanced on behalf of Lloyd's as to why, uniquely, it should be excluded from the Bill. Lloyd's argues that it is not primarily an investment business but is an insurance business which is rigorously supervised by the insurance division of the Department of Trade and Industry. Therefore, if Lloyd's is included in the Bill it will be being subjected to the insupportable burden of two layers of supervision. That argument might sound persuasive, but there is scarcely a person or an institution covered by the Bill that is not supervised under another provision by another authority. Banks, building societies, insurance companies, friendly societies, professionals and many other people are subject not only to two to three forms of supervision. In some cases there are three overlapping layers of supervision. No one has suggested that they should be excluded from the Bill, so why should Lloyd's be excluded?<br><br>
It is further argued that poor old Lloyd's went to the trouble of subjecting itself to a private Act in 1982, so it is unfair to burden it with the responsibilities under the Financial Services Bill when we do not know what the 1982 Act will produce. We are asked why it should suddenly change course in midstream. This Bill has a longish history but has been largely conceived, devised and drafted since 1982 and takes account of developments during that period.<br><br>
Much of the concern about City fraud has arisen since 1982. The process leading to the big bang originated in 1983. There has also been the Gower report, in part II, paragraph 305 of which Professor Gower refers to Lloyd's. He suggests that so far as Lloyd's carry out investment business—although he is more concerned with members' agents—there is no reason for it not to be in the Bill. That is exactly my view.<br><br>
However, the fact that we have legislated in the past for financial institutions does not preclude us—and never has done—from legislating again if necessary. Why worry about Johnson Matthey when we have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
Banking Act 1979? But that argument has not prevented the Government from producing their banking services White Paper and from perhaps legislating in the forthcoming Session. Therefore, I am not persuaded by the argument of the 1982 Act.<br><br>
Another argument is that Lloyd's has introduced an independent element into its council. The addition of three outside, independent members to the Lloyd's council is a welcome gesture but hardly of any great moment, notwithstanding the merits of those members, including Sir Kenneth Berrill. However, that is not an argument for exempting organisations from the Bill, because under schedule 2 every SRO will be required to have such independent members on its governing body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that such a requirement already exists under schedule 2? I remember his moving an amendment which asked for it. Perhaps I was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. However, the Minister made it clear that schedule 2 already contained a requirement of independence. We were anxious to strengthen and quantify that element of independence. No one suggested that if a potential, putative or existing SRO were to satisfy the requirement of independence, that would eliminate the need for the SRO to fulfill other obligations imposed by the Bill. If a governing body contains some independent representation, that does not exempt the organisation from complying with the Bill's other requirements.<br><br>
It is said that Lloyd's is squeaky clean, that worry over Lloyd's has been caused by events that occurred before 1982, and that whatever arguments develop over the Bill's general principles and scope, Lloyd's does not need regulation. I am not sure that anybody would take that argument seriously, but it is advanced seriously by Lloyd's. It says that if critics judge it on its post-1982 history there is nothing to worry about and no case for bringing it within the Bill.<br><br>
However, there are factors in Lloyd's post-1982 history that suggest that, at worst, Lloyd's has not put its house in order and that, at best, it has not learnt the importance of the involvement of outside regulation in the general principle of self-regulation. Lloyd's has been extremely remiss in its handling of the losses of those who suffered in the PCW syndicate affair—losses which materialised post-1982 although, admittedly, the affair was pre-1982. Lloyd's has not attempted to help those whose losses occurred because of its failure to supervise properly.<br><br>
If Lloyd's was meant to supervise the PCW syndicate to protect investors' interests, the fact that Peter Cameron-Webb and Peter Dixon were able to use arrangements such as re-insurance, offshore tax avoidance and baby syndicates to siphon off money from their syndicates shows that Lloyd's failed to supervise properly. Investors in the PCW syndicate did not lose money through trading losses, but through criminal fraud and theft that occurred while Lloyd's was supposed to be supervising the arrangement.<br><br>
I am inviting the Committee to examine what occurred not pre-1982 but post-1982, when Lloyd's not only failed to help those who lost money through the syndicate but positively obstructed their cause. I am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
sure that the hon. Member for Yeovil will join forces with me to confirm that names at the PCW syndicates have had a difficult struggle even to get to the negotiating table with Lloyd's. They have had to threaten Lloyd's with litigation. A parliamentary political campaign was needed simply to force Lloyd's into talking about the substantial losses which occurred under a supervisory regime for which it had responsibility.<br><br>
My second point concerns the recent involvement of the then chairman of Lloyd's, Sir Peter Green, in investigating those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that a number of hon. Members have met with those people? I asked specifically whether they had alleged in any way since 1982 that they had lost any money through fraud. They confirmed that they had not. When I asked why they felt that they had lost money, They said that the business underwritten had been imprudent business, and that the losses were due to bad management. That could have happened at any time, with any syndicate. It is not the function of the council of Lloyd's to decide what business should be written.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, in a sense, dragging me away from my point. Since 1982, Lloyd's has failed to help, or even to talk to those who have lost money, and has tried, indeed to obstruct them.<br><br>
After the frauds were admitted, Lloyd's tried to draw the difficult line between fraud, for which it accepted responsibility, and the losses that resulted from imprudent underwriting, which were deemed to be ordinary trading losses. That cannot be accepted, and my hon. Friends may be able to persuade the Committee that it is not true. But once the underwriting activities of a syndicate has suffered from such slack supervision that major losses have resulted from fraud, the syndicate managers have a great interest in maximising premium income, come what may. They want to cover their tracks. They are not interested in writing a large proportion of long-term business, because they will have skipped out. They will not have to face the consequences when called upon to do so by the policy holders, which happened with a number of asbestosis claims in the United States. Therefore, they can write business that no one will write.<br><br>
Let me turn now to a more recent matter, which should be recollected by every hon. Member present. Last July the Minister's predecessor, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Fletcher) told the House how many members of the PCW syndicates had satisfied the solvency test. The hon. Gentleman told the House a cock-and-bull story. He multiplied the number of people who had passed that test about five times. That is not in dispute. Where did the unfortunate Minister on that occasion get his information? Who misled him and put him in that embarrassing position, which may have jeopardised his ministerial position?<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
The answer is clear: it was Lloyd's. Peter Miller or someone at Lloyd's no doubt said that if they played a psychological game by pretending that large numbers had satisfied the solvency test, it would induce all those who had not yet done so to satisfy the test, so that when the figures came out they would be vindicated.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
So they said that they would tell the Minister a lie so that he, in turn, would tell the House of Commons a lie, which they hoped would work. Unfortunately the members of the PCW syndicate were made of sterner stuff and they were not corralled by that device. They did not pass the solvency test. When the figures came out we discovered that the Minister had misled the House and that he had been misled by Lloyd's.<br><br>
Are there still Conservative Members who would say that Lloyd's has learnt its lesson and and that it can be left to run its own affairs? I do not believe that we could be satisfied with such an assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman know when the Lloyd's Act was implemented? Does he accept that the Act, which was passed in 1982, covers matters relating to byelaws and the setting up of disciplinary procedures, all of which were produced after careful consideration by committees in Lloyd's? They were the product of the careful deliberations of the Committee considering the Lloyd's Bill, of which the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was the Chairman. Has the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) taken account of the fact that it takes time for an Act to be translated through all the implementing procedures to the point at which investigations can be followed up?<br><br>
Finally, on the question of prosecutions, does the hon. Gentleman accept that matter have been referred to the DPP and that questions have been raised in the House about the speed with which those matters are being pursued? The Government have made more resources available precisely to deal with those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a valiant and lengthy attempt to divert attention from the weight of the argument that I was about to conclude. I can understand why the hon. Gentleman may be unwilling to linger over it, but Lloyd's did mislead a Minister and put him in an embarrassing position.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the Lloyd's Act 1982 did not take effect until the following year; I cannot give the precise date, but I accept the thrust of his argument. Many changes undertaken, such as those in Lloyd's byelaws, were implemented then but others have been implemented very slowly. One of the most important rules about outlawing preferred syndicates has been implemented only recently, yet it is one of the most important vehicles for fraud and other problems that arose, as we know from the PCW case.<br><br>
The circumstances of the departure of the chief executive, Mr. Ian Hay Davison, and the grounds on which he felt constrained to resign, again show that Lloyd's has not learnt the lesson that an element of independent supervision must be imported where there is self-regulation. Opposition Members are not arguing against self-regulation; That is clear by now. But we are saying that self-regulation can work in the interests of those who are doing the regulating as well as those who are being regulated only if there is an element of outside supervision. The onus is on the Government to say why in this case, uniquely, that element of outside supervision should not be present.<br><br>
Ian Hay Davison did an excellent job in clearing up some of the problems at Lloyd's, yet he felt constrained to resign over this very issue. I am delighted that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
appointment of his successor, Alan Lord, has been announced. I wish him all success. I am glad that he is to take over the job on the same conditions as Mr. Hay Davison, but it took months, a major row, painful negotiations and, no doubt, pressure from the Government before that outcome was achieved.<br><br>
Furthermore, Lloyd's had problems with the tax authorities, which have been partly resolved only recently. That does not provide confidence in legislators that Lloyd's can be trusted with running its own affairs without outside supervision.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the absence of prosecutions. That is not entirely Lloyd's fault, but it has played a curious role. Difficulties and doubts have been raised about what evidence can be released to the DPP and so on. Lloyd's cannot be absolved entirely from responsibility for the fact that no major prosecution has yet taken place of some of the most important criminals to have emerged over the past 10 years.<br><br>
It was then argued—this is I think is the nub of the case put forward by the hon. Member for Yeovil—that the fact of the inquiry should induce us not to press for Lloyd's to be brought into the Bill. I think that some Conservative Members will have been seduced by that argument. However, the announcement of the inquiry was, on the one hand, one of the most transparent of delaying tactics, designed to trap the unwary. On the other hand, the announcement amounted to the fullest possible statement by the Government that Lloyd's, contrary to all its supporter's arguments, was not running itself satisfactorily.<br><br>
If, after the 1982 Act had taken effect, Lloyd's had put its house in order, what need was there for an inquiry? The Government, in announcing the inquiry, have conceded that there is something to be inquired into.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and I agree with many of the facts that he has described. However, we can start with the same facts and come to different conclusions.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Gentleman has not answered two questions. First, if he accepts that the Government have conceded that there is something wrong with Lloyd's, why will he not wait to see the results of the inquiry? After all, he can presume, as I did in my amendment, that Lloyd's can still be brought in if necessary. Secondly, before he sits down, will he say what are the disadvantages of including Lloyd's in the Bill? He has described the advantages in so doing. Has the hon. Gentleman given no weight to the disadvantages so clearly outlined by Sir Kenneth Berrill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil about the inquiry is not well taken. He still has to answer why we should extend to Lloyd's the unique privilege of a year's grace suggested in his amendment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman asked me two questions; when I attempted to answer the first he slid on to the second. I am quite prepared to go on to the second, but he must first face up to the fact that what he is advocating is that an institution with an admitted record of incompetent supervision, which conducts substantial investment business, has been excluded from the Bill. The hon. Gentleman's response is to defer a decision for a year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
Sir Kenneth Berrill is of course a member of the Lloyd's council—I make no point against him but simply register the fact—and he says that SIB would not have adequate resources to supervise Lloyd's. Of course the SIB will be under great pressure to supervise all sorts of people, but that case is not made in respect of ISRO, or LAUTRO, or LUTIRO, or the thousands of direct applications that will be made; SIB does not make it in respect of NASDIM or the stock exchange, or of all the recognised professional bodies, investment exchanges and so on. None of that supervision will stretch the resources of the SIB to breaking point, but it is argued—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We are relying on the hon. Gentlemen's account of what Sir Kenneth Berrill said; I am not making a point. The hon. Gentleman is clearly sensitive on this question, and we have touched on a raw spot in this debate.<br><br>
The SIB makes that point in respect of Lloyd's, but, as I told the hon. Gentleman in an intervention, Lloyd's is perhaps one of the few institutions already up and running and which, according to those who speak for it, is doing a wonderful job. All the rules are in place and no supervision is required, so where is the immense burden that will break the SIB?<br><br>
Hybridity may be a problem, but it is a problem for any Government wishing to legislate in that way, and they must overcome it. However, they will solve the problem if they make a policy decision that Lloyd's must be brought within the Bill.<br><br>
I have already dealt, to some extent, with Sir Kenneth Berrill's third point, that it would be difficult to regulate and supervise insurance activities. I do not ask the SIB to do that; I ask it to regulate and supervise investment business, which, in normal circumstances, would fall within the scope of the Bill.<br><br>
Let me consider one further argument contained in a paper produced by Lloyd's today, pointing out that Lloyd's is unusual, if not unique, because it must work with two sets of people—policyholders and members. That is different from almost every other investment business where the policyholders and the investors to be protected are the same people.<br><br>
I accept that, but I do not accept the conclusion that, because the policyholders' interests must always be paramount, no regulatory controls, such as those proposed in the Bill, should be imposed on the investors or that those managing investments on their behalf should not be subject to conduct of business rules, for example. That seems to be a total non sequitur. The striking of a financial balance between the interests of the policy holders and of the members is a difficult matter. I accept Lloyd's argument that the policyholders' interests in that respect must be paramount.<br><br>
But that is not what we are confronting in the Bill. We are asking why the underwriting agents at Lloyd's, should not be subject, like all other people carrying out investment business, to the conduct of business rules—for example, to the requirements of authorisation through an authorised SRO. The document produced by Lloyd's offers no answers to that problem.<br><br>
I am sorry that I have taken so much of the Committee's time, but I have been generous in giving way to interventions. We have to bring Lloyd's within the Bill,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
if we are serious about the Bill, and want to see the supervisory authorities and the rules and principles, set up under the Bill, grappling with the real problems in the City. People in the City have said to me, "We shall believe you're serious when you regulate Lloyd's." That view is widely held in the City. If, as the Bill proposes, we continue to make a special case for Lloyd's, and to exclude it by a special provision written into the Bill, many people in the City will conclude that we are not serious, and that the Bill is a charade, allowing those who need regulation to continue in the old way.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to reconsider this important matter. There are entrenched positions, and people have gone on record as saying they the take one position or another. It may be difficult at present for the Government to reconsider such a fundamental issue, but I urge them to do so for the sake of the Bill,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not taken an entrenched position, to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), on the important matter of including Lloyd's within the ambit of the Bill. But there is every justification for clause 40 to remain in the Bill, and I shall devote my remarks to that end.<br><br>
I must make it clear that I am not, have never been and do not intend to become a member of Lloyd's, although I have worked close to the organisation, and I am aware of many of its aspects. I do not hesitate in rising to defend Lloyd's but not because it is free of blemishes. We need only read the reports in the press over the past year to recognise that many matters have gone wrong there, and they have succeeded in besmirching the reputation of the institution.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
But, to listen to the constant chronicle of complaints about, and attacks upon, Lloyd's we would never know that it retains a worldwide reputation, and that its policyholders have not lost a penny. We would certainly never know that, when we in this country, often protected by parliamentary privilege, engage in vilifying Lloyd's, many other people in this country and abroad are anxious to become members, whether or not the investor protection—which Opposition Members suggest should be the reason for deleting clause 40 from the Bill—is extended to them. We would certainly never have guessed, in listening to speeches over the past year, that Lloyd's is the largest single contributor to invisible exports; that is an achievement to which we have paid inadequate attention.<br><br>
Two basic arguments are advanced for including Lloyd's in the Bill. The first is that self-regulation at Lloyd's is not working, and that, therefore, independent supervision of Lloyd's council is necessary. The second is that Lloyd's should not be singled out from other self-regulating institutions and exempted from external supervision.<br><br>
The first argument overlooks the fact—and I say this in spite of the largely reasonable comments of the hon Member for Dagenham—that all the scandals that have come to light recently occurred before the Lloyd's Act 1982, and the subsequent adoption of an extensive regulatory framework. I am not aware of any alleged miscounduct at Lloyd's, which has not already been,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
or is not now being, investigated by Lloyd's. The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) will probably contribute to the debate, and no doubt he will concentrate on more current difficulties such as the PCW incident, for example.<br><br>
A fair point is sometimes made that there has been inadequate support for, or movement towards, prosecution. In that respect, Lloyd's critics have a good deal on their side, but I have no evidence that failure to prosecute is, in any material way, due to Lloyd's laxity or reluctance. I attribute it more to the failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions Dept to conclude that it has sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction.<br><br>
Since the 1982 Act, there has been a formidable programme of self-regulation. Although everything is far from perfect in Lloyd's, considerable strides have been taken, which should be further extended, before we reverse the legislation so recently put on the statue book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch) </span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will comment on the fact that a solicitor, Mr. William Beckett, is puzzled by the activities of the Directors of Public Prosecutions Department. He said that the burden of proof required at Lloyd's is "beyond reasonable doubt". That is the burden of proof in a criminal case, so what is that hon. Gentleman's problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the problem is. Any allegation that there has been a lack of prosecution is not based on a lack of will at Lloyd's. It is said to be based on a lack of evidence to the DPP. I have no way of knowing whether that view is accurate, but if it is, it cannot be argued that part of the reason why these matters are not being put forward is the fact that Lloyd's is being unco-operative.<br><br>
The second main argument for putting Lloyd's under SIB could be phrased, "Why should it be excluded?" There are several arguments for its exclusion. First, to add another tier to the system of regulation at Lloyd's would single out Lloyd's as being in need of greater regulation than most other spheres of investment, assuming that the hon. Member for Dagenham is right to describe Lloyd's as being an investment business. It would not be wise to impose such a cumbersome system on Lloyd's alone.<br><br>
I recognise that many of the incidents involving Lloyd's during the past year or so have been most unfortunate. There is a powerful case for the self-regulation in the 1982 Act to be pursued by Lloyd's with the utmost vigour and to be watched over by the House with the utmost vigilance. But I cannot persuade myself that after a relatively short period there is now an argument for an additional tier of protection extending to Lloyd's alone.<br><br>
Secondly, SIB is designed to protect investors. I recognise that we have a debate across the Committee about whether we are talking about investors. I lay before the Committee the proposition that to become an underwriter at Lloyd's is a considerably more complex act than that of buying a security or a life policy. It involves a financial commitment of a very different kind and scale. The hon. Member for Dagenham has paid insufficient attention to that point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
Finally, the degree of external supervision, which is the whole basis of introducing SIB in other spheres, is opposed by Lloyd's because Lloyd's already has considerable external supervision. Lloyd's council contains eight elected external names and four nominated members, whose appointments must be approved by the governor of the Bank of England and who have a power of veto over major matters.<br><br>
I contend that the degree of self-regulation extending to Lloyd's is considerable. I have heard no argument that proves the need to impose yet another tier of protection on those referred to as investors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I dealt with some of the hon. Gentleman's arguments earlier, but he has introduced a new argument that there is something unique, or perhaps peculiar and different, about the nature of the investment at Lloyd's notwithstanding the statement that it would normally be investment business under the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
I had lunch today with people who operate in the Eurobond market. They felt that they too were involved in a very different kind of business, but they did not argue that on that ground alone they should be exempted from the Bill and I cannot see why Lloyd's should make that argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be surprised if the Eurobond people who entertained the hon. Gentleman to lunch— <i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am sorry to hear that they did not give the hon. Gentleman lunch. He should have said nicer things about them in Committee earlier.<br><br>
The Eurobond people are saying that one tier of supervision is probably too much for them. I suggest that to apply another tier of supervision to Lloyd's alone seems unjustified. If it were applied, one could then reasonably assume that we were saying that Lloyd's present regulatory system had been a failure. I do not accept that that is so. Although it may turn out to be so after the Lloyd's Act has been given a further period to prove itself, it would be extremely premature to draw that conclusion now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to contest every point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but he slid off the point of the uniqueness of Lloyd's investment and on to his other argument, which was that Lloyd's is already supervised. Virtually everyone covered by the Bill will be supervised by some other authority. Indeed, the people with whom I had an enjoyable lunch were complaining bitterly that the Bank of England would be supervising all their activities. So Lloyd's is not unique in that respect, either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the Bank of England. It will not have escaped his notice that stemming from the Lloyd's Act 1982 the governor of the Bank of England is very much involved in the supervision of Lloyd's. Although I said that I would resist the movement from one tier to two tiers of supervision, if we embrace the Bank of England in our argument, we are really talking about moving from two tiers to three tiers. Far from denying my argument, in many ways the hon. Member for Dagenham underlines it.<br><br>
I do not want to delay the Committee for much longer, but I want to examine Lloyd's position as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
insurers. I must repeat that all the headlines about Lloyd's over the past year or two have made no allegations that Lloyd's has failed as insurers. The contrary is true. No recent events have cast doubt on the security of a Lloyd's policy in this country or internationally. No claim by a policyholder has gone unpaid, or is in danger of doing so.<br><br>
If I irritate some members of the Committee by repeating and underlining that point it is because, amid the lurid headlines about the scandals that we all deplore, it is easy to overlook that fundamental fact.<br><br>
I turn now to Lloyd's and investment and take up the point that the hon. Member for Dagenham made about what my hon. Friend the Minister said at an earlier sitting. I take a simple view. I do not believe that Lloyd's investment bears any real resemblance to an investment decision of the type designed to be covered by the Bill. All the underlying factors lead me to believe that members of Lloyd's are themselves insurers and not investors in insurance. If any member of the Committee has reason to question that, I remind him that taxation of an investment in Lloyd's is based on the fact that Lloyd's is acting as insurers and not as investors.<br><br>
Finally, I want to put forward some general arguments for not extending the scope of the Bill to include Lloyd's. It is easy to overlook the fact that Lloyd's is a long-standing, well-known and, dare I say, still well-respected international institution which gives a good deal of satisfaction to its customers in many parts of the world and I want to underline some figures. I spoke earlier of Lloyd's importance in invisible earnings. Overseas earnings for the insurance sector for 1984, the last year for which I have figures, gave £560 million earnings from the companies, £427 million from the brokers, and £564 million for Lloyd's. That is a magnificent achievement and we should be careful not to cast it aside.<br><br>
Many reforms pressed upon Lloyd's as a result of the 1982 Act have already been achieved. It is easy to overlook the fact that divestment by brokers of ownership of managing agents required by Parliament has gone ahead. It is also easy to overlook the new system of investigation and discipline, in respect of which I pay tribute to the present chief executive, Mr. Hay Davison. Like the hon. Member for Dagenham, I regret his departure. However, I see no reason to doubt that the policies embarked on under the 1982 Act and reformed by Mr. Hay Davison will be carried on by Mr. Lord, the new chief executive.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
I believe that Lloyd's should continue to be exempted from the Bill because it has its own tailor-made regulatory system which flows from an Act of Parliament only a few years old. Self-regulation at Lloyd's is effective in practice and there is no evidence of failure of Lloyd's competence or willingness to outlaw malpractice. Lloyd's already possesses the structure and powers that the Bill envisages for an SRO. A dual system of self regulation would mean a loss of flexibility to respond as swiftly as we expect it to do, which is a further reason to retain the clause.<br><br>
I hope that I have said sufficient to persuade hon. Members that there is a good deal going for Lloyd's.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
It is beginning to triumph over its undoubted difficulties of recent years. Rather than continuing to make life difficult for those of its members who do so well in the interests of invisible exports in this country, the Committee should assist it to regain its former reputation by retaining clause 40.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made an outstanding speech. If Conservative Members were to use their critical faculties, which I am sure they can do occasionally with permission from the Front Bench, it would be incomprehensible if they did not support my hon. Friend in deleting the clause.<br><br>
I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. Donald) to our Front Bench, as she has been sadly missed on the Committee. I should also like to welcome the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Coventry, South-West (Mr. Butcher) who has been forced to participate and speak from a special position of ignorance because his Under-Secretary colleague refused to take out a benefits and burdens policy which would have alleviated him of all his stake in Lloyd's. I am told that he could have done it for £5,000, but perhaps he thought it too high a price.<br><br>
I sympathise with the Minister. He has been sent down from a forge in the Midlands to move into the City's biggest slurry pit, and it will cause him problems in the debate. He did not make a good start. He said that we did not want delay, as that would be damaging to Lloyd's. That is an extraordinary comment from a representative of a Government who have just set up an inquiry designed to produce precisely that delay. That does not auger well. He was telling us that whatever the inquiry said, Lloyd's will not come within the ambit of the Bill and no major modifications will be made to the Lloyd's Act 1982.<br><br>
However, the inquiry was set up because of a potential Conservative Back-Bench rebellion on the clause. I have talked to many of those rebels but there are none on the Committee. Probably the selection of Conservative Members for the Committee also shows that the Government have fixed minds on this point. We do not have a flexibly-minded Committee on this critical issue.—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We will judge when we see whether the clause is accepted. Conservative Members have come along with us on some of our amendments. Let us see what happens in the vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the way in which the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) said that Conservative Members have come with Labour Members on some amendments. The truth is contrary. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that I had not followed through the rhetoric of one of my earlier speeches, but the Labour party has not followed through the rhetoric of its speeches on Second Reading. It is not so much that Conservative Members have come along with the Labour party on some of its amendments, as they have outflanked them in terms of strength.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn into that argument. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is perhaps sensitive because my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has given him a drubbing today. The hon. Gentleman has indulged in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
the Liberal vocabulary of fudge, mudge, procrastination and delay.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman argued that SIB would not have sufficient resources. What resources it will have depends on the resources that the Government give it, and on the Government's insistence that it should get the resources. He said that Sir Kenneth Berrill thought that SIB would find it difficult to get the resources. I met Sir Kenneth at the Training and Civil Service College in Sunningdale Park, Ascot. We strolled in the sun by the azaleas in the garden, and Sir Kenneth explained to me the difference between a scientist and an economist. He said that scientists sometimes get it right. That is the only statement of his with which I have ever agreed. He usually gets it wrong. He has got it wrong on nuclear power, on Lloyd's, and on the powers of the SIB.<br><br>
The fence-sitting of the hon. Member for Yeovil reminds me of how Disraeli described Gladstone—or was it how Gladstone described Disraeli?—his only principle was lack of a principle. The hon. Gentleman seems to think that Lloyd's can be in the Bill and out of the Bill at the same time. I refer him to Bertrand Russell's theory of the undistributed middle. He said that a thing could not be black and white all over at the same time. It is not possible, even in Liberal theology—however metaphysical it may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to do better than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?<br><br>
We are dealing with a critical clause. The Committee will make itself a laughing-stock, if it does not get rid of the clause. Are we serious about protecting investors, catching criminals and fraudsters, and regulating the City?<br><br>
If the clause were to stay in the Bill, it would not just mean that democracy has gone soft. It would mean that democracy has gone mad, and time would prove that it is going corrupt. The public would gawp at it, the City would snigger, and the names at Lloyd's would blush at what is being done in their name. It would be infamy confounded by naivety.<br><br>
The drafting of clause 40 is an extraordinary move by Ministers. In Dante's "Inferno" the worst of the usurers were in circle seven, where they stood on hot sands beneath burning rain. The Bill would take them out of circle seven and give them special privileges.<br><br>
What are the public to make of the clause? For the past year they have been reading about two major financial scandals in the City. One was in a little merchant bank, Johnson Matthey Bankers, the other was in Lloyd's. How has Parliament responded to those scandals? In identical fashion. To its disgrace, it keeps both banking and Lloyd's out of the Bill.<br><br>
The public have read about two people laundering £40 million into jet aircrafts, villas in the South of France, pornographic films, and blood stock in Ken tucky. They have read about the timelag in the inquiries, the complete lack of prosecution—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman can see that I am in the middle of a sentence. The public have read that none of the fraudsters have been brought to court, and they will gawp if Parliament says that Lloyd's which has allowed that state of affairs to arise, is to be the second major organisation to be excluded from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I had not appreciated that the hon. Gentleman was in the middle of a sentence. Perhaps his sentences are so long that it is difficult to distinguish where they begin and where they end.<br><br>
Could the hon. Gentleman assist me? Is it his party's policy to include banking in the Bill? Many Conservative Members were not aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the sad things about the Labour party is that it does not allow me to make policy on the hoof. I gather that that is something that the Prime Minister does for the Conservative party—we can see the extraordinary damage that the habit has caused.<br><br>
I believe that Labour party policy would have been to bring banking within the Bill, but we think that there may be other ways of dealing with it in the near future, as we are expecting to come to power shortly.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham ably made this point. This is not a pragmatic argument. That may sound odd, as this is a country which is supposed to act empirically and pragmatically. There is a fundamental, in-principle argument, put from Opposition Benches—but which Government Members under no circumstances and for some reason that I do not understand, will not accept—that in any SRO there is bound, by definition, to be a conflict of interest.<br><br>
If the public is to be satisfied that there is some mechanism to deal with a conflict of interest, at least some—one can debate how much—independent arbitration, and some independent judgment must be built into the structure.<br><br>
Sir Patrick Neill could sit for a thousand years, and he will not be able to get round that principle. That is why the inquiry is bogus. It does not matter what he drags up—he may not drag up one extra piece of fraud that has occurred in Lloyd's or one breach of any regulation since the passing of the 1982 Act and since the passing of the individual byelaws. That does not matter. We are talking of a conflict of interest and the way in which a responsible Parliament attempts to resolve it.<br><br>
The argument was best put to me by a senior financial journalist, who said "I have been talking to people, senior names, at Lloyd's for eight years. Your problem, Sedgemore, is that you do not understand that they do not recognise a conflict of interest. The only thing that they ever recognise at Lloyd's is that they would like their organisation to be reasonably honest, but basically, they are in the business of making money." He said, "You would not find that attitude on the stock exchange. In hardly any other sphere of public life is there a body of people whose heads are so buried in the sand, so devoid of reality, and so devoid of the fiscal and fiduciary morality which most of us would expect to be commonplace in any organisation." That is the problem. The journalist said to me, "They know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
that in time the Lloyd's Act will become distant; you will disappear from the scene, Sedgemore, and they will hope to return their to their cosy incestuous world, and get on with the job of making money. In the past they have allowed theft, fraud and tax evasion to become custom and practice and they will think of new methods of arranging those in the future." My informant does not vote Labour, but Conservative, and he does not write for a paper that remotely supports the Labour party.<br><br>
That is the in-principle argument for bringing Lloyd's into the Bill, for that is how Lloyd's has operated over the past eight years. I do not think that any Conservative Members here—except the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, the hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) are, or have been, members of Lloyd's. I simply cannot understand why they do not accept that that is how Lloyd's operates and that is how it will continue to operate.<br><br>
What does Sir Nicholas Goodison think of the differing treatment of the Stock Exchange and Lloyd's in relation to the way in which those two bodies behave?</span></p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are different bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course they are different bodies. Lloyd's and the stock exchange are complete opposites in one major respect. The people who run the stock exchange are basically honest, although dishonest players are increasingly moving into the investment business. Sir Nicholas Goodison and his team are trying to do an honest job. However, 1 believe that Lloyd's is not such an honest organisation. I bear no malice against Lloyd's or the names. The names have asked me to argue their case in the House of Commons. Of about 25,000 names, 24,600 are perfectly honest. But of the dishonest people, too many have been at the top of Lloyd's.<br><br>
The institution that is trying to run an honest operation against increasing difficulties with the coming of the big bang will be overseen by SIB. Yet Lloyd's, where people at the top have behaved in a scandalous and outrageous fashion, will not. How do Conservative Members respond to that? Lloyd's is different from several of the other SROs because some people at the top at Lloyd's do not know the difference between right and wrong. Too many people have refused to recognise the conflicts of interest involved in operations under their control.<br><br>
I do not know why the chief executive of Lloyd's has left, but it does not augur well. He has written to me saying that there have never been any differences between him and Sir Peter Miller. He would not say otherwise or explain the real reasons in a letter to me. I am sure that he would not confide in me. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Members are laughing, so that proves my point. The only conceivable reason for Ian Hay Davison to leave is that he has been eased out of the post as chief executive of Lloyd's because of difficulties between him and Sir Peter Miller over the way in which the body should be regulated.<br><br>
I do not want to attack Alan Lord, but I was astonished to read in one of the papers that he considers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
himself qualified for the job of chief executive of Lloyd's because of his toughness, which was proved by the fact that he had sacked 9,000 people at Dunlop. As Alan Lord was a Permanent Secretary, and probably went to either Oxford or Cambridge, I am sure that he understands Aristotelan syllogisms and non-sequiturs. To conclude that because he sacked 9,000 people at Dunlop he is capable of becoming the chief executive at Lloyd's, is a curious non-sequitur.<br><br>
Moreover, from the time that Johnson Matthey Bankers collapsed and was taken over by the Bank of England the person who is to become chief executive at Lloyd's was a non-executive director of that company. Do I live in Alice's Wonderland? I am privileged because I have seen piles of papers on JMB negotiations to put back in business such criminals as Mr. Mahoud Sipra, Mr. Abdul Shanji and Mr. Michael Hepker. If Mr. Alan Lord presided over such negotiations, even in non-executive capacity, he is the last person to be in charge of Lloyd's. Yet we are told that we do not need SIB to oversee Lloyd's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should make it clear that Mr. Lord was installed by the Bank of England to investigate the events with which the hon. Gentleman—under privilege—is trying to link him. That is an unethical position for the hon. Gentleman to take in the Committee. In fact the date of his appointment was October 1985.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the Bank of England installed Mr. Alan Lord. The whole thing has been a shambles, from start to finish. The operation, from the governor of the Bank of England, down to the executive directors who run Johnson Matthey Bankers, has been a disgrace to British banking. I do not believe that the events to date—February 1986—can be justified. But if the Minister wants to justify what has happened—and it appears that he does—his view of integrity in British banking must be different from mine. Perhaps standards of integrity have changed since I worked in the Civil Service, and since the Minister took office. Times change, and old-fashioned fuddy duddies like me cannot keep up with the slick methods of the modern world.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has pointed out that Lloyd's is distinguished from other SROs because it is the only one whose chairman has been manifestly dishonest. His public statements have shown that dishonesty, and yet no charges have been brought against him. How can that be consistent with the claim that Lloyd's should not be supervised? It seems that Peter Green has been given some sort of amnesty, but if he has not, why do Lloyd's not make that clear? We could then go on to the next point.<br><br>
There has been evidence of contempt of the law at Lloyd's. Where such contempt exists at the top, how can such an institution claim that it does not need supervision by a higher body? Several of the syndicates of Lloyd's have refused to accept people as members because those people have started litigation proceedings against their existing syndicates. That is worse than straightforward theft by dishonest people, such as Mr. Walrock, Mr. Cameron-Webb, Mr. Grob and Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
Dixon. The syndicates have been saying, "If you are going to exercise your legal rights, granted to you by Parliament, we won't have you in our syndicate." That is the most shocking contempt for the rule of law, which suggests that Lloyd's needs regulation from on high.<br><br>
I have come across solicitors who have been pressurised by syndicates to drop cases where people have attempted to litigate. That is another example of contempt for the rule of law which again confirms my view, as a barrister, that Lloyd's council needs supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterflll</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that some Conservative Members have been told that membership of other syndicates has been declined not because of members' litigation against their previous syndicates, but because of their refusal to pay what they owe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be one example, but it is wholly off the point. What the hon. Gentleman is saying may be true as a matter of fact, but I do not think that it absolved those people who are saying, "You are going to litigate against your previous syndicate, therefore we do not want you." I have letters that tell people that they are not wanted for just that reason. They do not say, "We do not want you because you haven't paid up" but, "We don't want you because you're going to undertake the process of litigation."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way, but since the hon. Gentleman is about to rise, will he say whether he thinks that is a satisfactory way for people at Lloyd's to behave, particularly when they are senior members and on the council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But will the hon. Gentleman accept that those who are refusing to pay up are those who are litigating? The reason that they are litigating is that they are refusing to pay. Can the hon. Gentleman give any example of anyone who is litigating who has not refused to pay up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The example that I gave on the Floor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D N Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A farmer in Sussex.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to a farmer, though it is not in Sussex, but Suffolk. He is right. That happened, and it had nothing to do with people refusing to pay up. T do not know whether the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) thinks that he knows about the case, but I can assure him that it falls four square within what we are discussing.<br><br>
The association of names has written to me—as it has to other hon. Members—and I have tried to reply in detail, as I am sure that the association is doing its best for its names. However—quite apart from the fact that the association appears to reject the in-principle argument, and that it refuses to accept that Lloyd's may go back to its bad old ways; there are many people who would like that to happen—the association appears to advance a wholly false argument. It says that if Lloyd's has to pass all these byelaws it will take a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
considerable time; SIB will then have to vet all the byelaws and approve them. Unless I am mistaken, that is not what is required in the Bill.<br><br>
If Lloyd's pass its byelaws and SIB thinks that it is doing a good job, I do not understand where the extra resources that Sir Kenneth Berrill says are desperately needed will come in. If Sir Kenneth Berrill is satisfied that all arrangements are being made properly and the byelaws are being passed in time, why does he need all the resources, and why will there be the extra time lag? No extra time need be taken up at all, if Lloyd's is operating properly. The stock exchange has an admirable series of rules, so SIB will not have to spend its time there, although presumably it will spend time on the other SROs.<br><br>
Conservative Members may be privy to information that I do not have, but in the Committee they have placed a great deal of weight on the Lloyd's Act 1982, enacted on 1 January 1983. They ignore the fact that two of the people who gave evidence on that Bill were Mr Grob and Mr Walrock, not the most honest people to give evidence to a Committee of the House.<br><br>
Conservative Members then rush in and say that my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was Chairman of the Committee, and that makes it all right. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West is a great friend of mine—I used to share a room with him—but I do not believe in the Oldham doctrine: if my hon. Friend says that is all right, by definition it is all right. I am sure that my hon. Friend can make mistakes, and he can be deceived by sophisticated criminals giving evidence. Those witnesses were highly sophisticated and slick, and my hon Friend was deceived in the way that the rest of us might be.<br><br>
Conservative Members go on to say that there has been no fraud since 1982.1 suspect that they are wrong. I am advised by those who operate on the side of both legality and illegality at Lloyd's in senior positions, that there has been fraud since 1982, and that the fraud in the Peter Cameron-Webb syndicate did not stop on 31 December 1982 just because there was a Bill. No one said, "Oh my God, they've introduced a Bill. Let's get rid of that Gibraltar account with Mr. Hassan." Life is not like that. It was not like that at Brooks and Dooley, where the crime continued after 1982.1 do not know whether, as I suspect, there has been fraud at Bellew Parry Raven but there has certainly been tax evasion and it did not stop in 1982.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
It is a monstrosity to think that the House of Commons produced a Bill and solved the problem. What kind of world do we live in? Why do not Conservative Members live in the real world instead of the fantasy world of Lloyd's handouts? Even the Prime Minister has grasped that point in letters to me. She is obviously more carefully advised and uses the phrase "originated before 1982" although she cannot prove even that. She does not know whether fraud in 1983 originated before 1982. The phrase is just another gloss on the Lloyd's propaganda. I ask Conservative Members to live in the real world and to try to sort out what has happened about those crimes. There should at least be some fundamental agreement about the facts.<br><br>
The question of political bias is not central to my argument but it is worth mentioning in the House of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
Commons. My example will cause great laughter. CND has a big balloon which is often shows. CND tried to insure the balloon at Lloyd's and was given a reasonable quote of about £700. Then the politicians at Lloyd's stepped in and CND was quoted £7,500 a year, which was an astronomical and ridiculous premium. CND has now had the balloon insured in Italy for about £600. There have been no problems with the insurance and £600 is a standard balloon charge. That is an example of vindictive political malice. It is not central to my argument because it relates to only one syndicate, but taken with the other facts it shows that there is an overwhelming case—the in-principle case, backed by the past practices of Lloyd's.<br><br>
I ask Conservative Members to talk not to me but to their Back Bench colleagues, who are terrified about what has happened at Lloyd's. They used to go to meetings with Malcolm Pearson to discuss what they could do and they were desperately sorry that immunity was granted to Lloyd's. Conservative Members should try telling their Back-Bench colleagues that Lloyd's is not an investment business. I have hardly met a name who does not perceive Lloyd's as an investment business.<br><br>
Let us take the case of an elderly farmer's wife in the Peter Cameron-Webb syndicate. Conservative Members may laugh, but she was the first person to come to me. She had about £100,000 invested and she was not exactly my friend. She said, "For every £20,000 they are asking me to give them about £150,000." Who can cough up £750,000 on such a gigantic fraud? It is nothing to laugh at. Of course Lloyd's is an investment business and of course that woman deserves some protection.<br><br>
Conservative Members ask, "What kind of protection?" Surely Lloyd's is in charge and should think the matter out, but I have a suggestion. Lloyds might put pressure on Minet Holdings to come up with a bit more money. Although Lloyd's has a welcome principle of unlimited liability it could examine whether the principle of unlimited liability would stand up and protect the farmer's wife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We always listen to the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) with amusement. Clearly, he is genuinely convinced by his own rhetoric, and we respect that. I can take the colour with which the hon. Gentleman speaks. I can even take—although I may regret—the way in which he abuses parliamentary privilege in castigating people outside the House and making allegations against them. I can take the way in which the hon. Gentleman assumes a monopoly of wisdom about some City matters, but what I cannot take is the unctuous piety with which he accuses Conservative Members and the Government of having no interest in seeing fair play by investors or the proper operation of the markets and the observance of the law in the respects that we have discussed.<br><br>
This Government have brought forward the Bill, not the Labour Government which the hon. Gentleman served as a Member of Parliament. This Government introduced the Companies Act 1980, which dealt with many of the abuses on the stock market that were prevalent during the Labour Government's period of power. What legislation did the hon. Gentleman's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
Government introduce, apart from measures to centralise control in the industrial field to deal with current abuses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member so early in his speech, but the answer is that I believe that the Labour Government made insider dealing illegal. I remember sitting on the Committee that discussed the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can now come on to the stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that it was the Companies Act 1980 that dealt with the problem of insider dealing.<br><br>
I take the view that I took on Second Reading— sadly, I cannot declare an interest as a member of Lloyd's—that, for a variety of reasons, Lloyd's is a different sort of business. It is not fundamentally an investment business. Participants in Lloyd's have more the characteristics of sole traders than passive investors. Because its business is fundamentally different, it should not be brought within the ambit of the Bill.<br><br>
I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I am sure that Opposition Members believe what they say, but they will not serve their own interests in seeking to get better regulation of Lloyd's by bringing its investment activities within the ambit of the Bill. I shall explain why.<br><br>
Admittedly, investment management is part of the operation of Lloyd's; it has to manage its assets on which to found its business. But that is not its principal aspect; it is not its main business. The mechanics by which Lloyd's works and by which the insurance business is conducted is largely without the mechanisms of investment dealing and the mechanisms that could reasonably be governed or controlled by the Secretary of State of the SIB. If the investment management area of Lloyd's is brought within the ambit of the Bill, not only will it be much more difficult later, either by means of introducing a new private Bill—or a public Bill if the problem of hybridity can be overcome—to deal with what may be only potential problems—here I agree with the hon Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch that there may be problems—but it will be much more difficult to have a statutory instrument by which do deal with that.<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, there is a case for a review of Lloyd's. If significant improvements can be made on the 1982 Act, there may be a case for another private Bill. Perhaps we should admit that we got it wrong and did not go far enough in that private Bill, although at the time Parliament went a good deal further than Lloyd's and much of outside opinion wanted us to go but, with hindsight, perhaps Parliament did not go far enough.<br><br>
There may be a case for a private Bill or for a public Bill. I suspect that the review will show that there is a case for strictures to be placed by the Government and Sir Kenneth Berrill on the council of Lloyd's, which will then introduce voluntarily some changes in its own rules. The Government may say that that will be sufficient and that they will wait to see what is proposed. However, the prospects of tighter controls and perhaps necessary changes in the rules of Lloyd's will be weakened if this aspect of Lloyd's—which is not the main

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
area where the losses and frauds have occurred—is included in the Bill.<br><br>
On Second Reading I suggested that if an alternative body providing a means of control were to be introduced, it should consider such matters as the statutory or mandatory appointment of a chief executive, setting down clearly his terms of reference. I understand that that is not currently included in the rules.<br><br>
Secondly, such a body should investigate and prescribe the legal responsibilities of Lloyd's policy-signing office. It is the tardiness with which records have been compiled in some cases and the lack of information provided there which has enabled certain malpractices to continue. If the investment management activities of Lloyd's were brought within the Bill by the exclusion of clause 40, the activities of the policy-signing office would still not be controlled, although they perhaps need to be.<br><br>
Thirdly, such a body should consider disclosure on matters such as reinsurance to close which has been a major source of problems, as has information on the credentials of offshore rollover funds. All those problems, and the covert way in which certain malpractices and frauds have been allowed to continue, would not be dealt with if clause 40 were struck out. We need to get to the heart of the matter.<br><br>
If Opposition Members wish these matters to be dealt with properly, they should pay more respect to the Government's intention to set up a proper review of them and more respect to Sir Kenneth Berrill, which he deserves for his integrity, incisiveness and objectivity. By adopting more effective, tailer-made means we shall be able to deal with these matters at a later stage.<br><br>
The exclusion of the clause would be a positive detriment to the possibility of changes in the future. For these reasons and others, and despite the undoubtedly powerful views held by senior Back Benchers on both sides of the House, I hope that sense and reason will prevail and that we will not insist on including this limited aspect of Lloyd's in the Bill. We should keep our minds open for a better way of dealing with these matters later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) who touched on the key criterion. I rather enjoyed the part of the speech of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) where he referred to principle. The hon. Member for Chichester was not driven by principle or dogma,—having made up one's mind beforehand—but by considerations of what was the most practical method of proceeding to provide the safeguards in Lloyd's that the hon. Gentleman believes as strongly as I do should be provided.<br><br>
I do not wish to defend Lloyd's. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) gave us an interesting characteristic, thorough, well-presented, well-researched, almost universal indication of the points at issue. However, I cannot share the compliments offered by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shore-ditch on his conclusions.<br><br>
The passionate plea of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch for all of us to use our rational faculties was one of the richer moments that I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
have experienced in the House of Commons. I also found quite rich the comments of the hon. Member for Dagenham. I have already covered the matter, but it is worth returning to it.</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying to my hon. Friends that the hon. Gentleman has spent the past five minutes knocking Labour Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might learn what it is like to be a single voice in Committee, without the background shouting to support hon. Members. Often the arguments are carried more by volume than logic.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham said that my proposal was a soft option. However, as the <i>Financial Times</i> commented, there is an interesting contradiction between the Second Reading speech of the shadow spokesman on trade and industry, which was strong in rhetoric, and the amendments tabled by Opposition Members, which are often considerably weaker than those tabled by some Conservative Members.<br><br>
Opposition Members have made Lloyd's a point of great principle, perhaps they need to nail something to the mast to satisfy their extreme Left wing, perhaps that is the symbolic action that they must take; there is no other logical explanation for it. We are tempted to look at <i>Labour Weekly</i> to see whether any of the Opposition Members who spoke so strongly about the matter will be subject to reselection in the near future. That may be connected with the matter.<br><br>
Let us return to the main point under debate, on which the hon. Members for Dagenham and for Chichester agree. It will be important to see whether the Minister agrees too. We agree that something must be done about Lloyd's. The argument that separates me from Labour Members has been powerfully put and well-rehearsed by the hon. Member for Dagenham, in his usual competent style. We must ask whether it is right to bring Lloyd's under the Bill. What is the most effective mechanism for coping with the problems in Lloyd's that he evinced so powerfully, and that were also mentioned by the hon. Member for Chichester? We part company on that issue.<br><br>
Part of the speech of the hon. Member for Dagenham was inadequate because he failed to recognise what would be the burdens. He has often prayed in aid Sir Kenneth Berrill, but, in an uncharacteristically regrettable part of his speech, he appeared to make a subtle innuendo which casts doubt on Sir Kenneth's integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, "We have to remember that Sir Kenneth is a member of Lloyd's." What would be the point of saying that if it was not to undermine the integrity of Sir Kenneth, whom the hon. Gentleman has so often prayed in aid?<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me what were the burdens to which Sir Kenneth Berrill referred. They are the burdens of introducing a fully operational system, under a semi quasi self-regulating organisation. The present system is wholly inadequate, and, therefore, needs changing. It would, therefore, be brought under the SIB with a great deal of momentum and established practice behind it, but, nevertheless, it would still be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0219">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
inadequate. Sir Kenneth's comments showed precisely the nature of the problem facing the SIB in instituting those changes.<br><br>
If the situation is as bad as the hon. Member for Dagenham says, the burden that will be placed on the SIB to bring Lloyd's under control while seeking to do so much else in the next year to establish SROs and to float them off will be considerable. No doubt that is what Sir Kenneth Berrill was referring to in his speech that the hon. Gentleman could not recollect.<br><br>
If those changes in Lloyd's are required who, other than the SIB, would carry them out? Where would Lloyd's find the resources? Those are the burdens to which Sir Kenneth Berrill referred and about which I am worried. In seeking to establish itself the procedures of the Bill in the next year, the SIB will be stretched, whatever its resources.<br><br>
The time frame will cause the SIB to work very hard, even if it is given the resources that I suspect the Minister will not wish to give it but which we should like to see. Even if the SIB were given the full resources to which the hon. Member for Dagenham referred, it would still be stretched. To say that whatever happens Lloyd's should come within the ambit of the Bill will add extra burdens, which should not be added unless it is necessary.<br><br>
That brings me to whether it is necessary. There is a large question mark over that because we do not know the Government's attitude to the Neill report or their intentions about what needs to be done.<br><br>
I thought that the logic of the hon. Member for Dagenham seemed to be inadequate. He said that the Government have conceded that something is wrong yet he is not prepared to wait for a fully fledged inquiry to show what is wrong. Whatever the Government's intentions about delaying tactics, there will be a full inquiry, which is being taken seriously, and will not doubt be the subject of debate in the House.<br><br>
Why will not the hon. Gentleman wait for the the outcome? He called for an inquiry with such power and he maintains that it is the Labour party which raised these issues. The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch is campaigning on this area, even though he has adopted tactics to which I do not subscribe. Nevertheless, Opposition Members have put the Government into a position of having to set up an inquiry. So, having pressed so hard for the inquiry and counting its setting up as a considerable victory, why are not Opposition Members prepared to wait for the result before pushing ahead?<br><br>
We are lead ineluctably to the conclusion that the only reason is the dogma, masquerading as principle, that the hon. Member for Dagenham and for Hackney, South and Shoreditch have outlined. They have entered the debate with closed minds, otherwise they would be prepared to wait and see. I agree with the arguments of the hon. Member for Dagenham but I disagree with the conclusions that he has reached.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman seems to have missed one fact that may support the general case that something needs to be done about Lloyd's. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) this morning mentioned a curious letter dated 24 January covering a four or five page document dated 8 January about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
the exemption of Lloyd's from the Financial Services Bill. The document is shot through with so much self-righteousness and self-satisfaction that it shows an attitude in Lloyd's that will have to be changed. That attitude is also evident in Peter Miller's own view. The document says that Lloyd's has its own tailor-made regulatory system. That is not good enough. The regulation system that we wish to impose on Lloyd's is not tailor-made to its own requirements but has greater independence.<br><br>
It is claimed that self-regulation at Lloyd's has proved effective. Tell that to some of the people who have sought redress for what they regard as inadequacies in the PCW scandal! It is said that there are "fit and proper" persons in place. I am not sure that that is so The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch does not have to go all the way with his accusations for me to accept that there is a big question mark over whether "fit and proper" persons are all those involved in the present regulation. The document of 8 January says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Lloyd's already possesses the structure and powers that the Bill envisages for an SRO."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that it possesses anything like the powers of an SRO in terms of equivalent status as envisaged in the Bill. It lists the disadvantages of including Lloyd's in the Bill, such as "loss of flexibility" if it's had to respond to the rules of SIB and it explains why. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"to bring Lloyd's under the umbrella of SIB would be perceived as a failure of the present Lloyd's regulatory system"—</p></blockquote>
that is true enough—
<br><blockquote><p>"which is demonstrably untrue and this could have serious repercussions for Lloyd's foreign business and its international standing."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that Lloyd's present international standing has been damaged not because of the way in which business has been controlled, investigated and followed through, but because of the way that they have not. That shows a disturbing degree of self-satisfaction.<br><br>
My view is reinforced by a speech from Peter Miller on Thursday 13 February 1986 to the Risk Research Group conference. T am sure that copies have been circulated to the Committee. Does the Minister agree with Mr. Miller's astonishing statement that
<br><blockquote><p>"The problems"—</p></blockquote>
of Lloyd's—
<br><blockquote><p>"concern only the individuals wealthy enough to become Members of the Society"?</p></blockquote>
They certainly do not. The concern the public at large and the reputation of the City in particular. Mr. Miller said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Protection of policyholders is not at issue and has never been a problem."</p></blockquote>
That is true.<br><br>
Mr. Miller continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The test we have to pass as a Council of Lloyd's is, as Sir Henry Fisher said, to provide the Members of Lloyd's trading in the business of insurance at Lloyd's through their agents, with that measure of protection which they cannot reasonably be expected to obtain by their own efforts. That and that alone is at issue in this matter. Beyond this"—</p></blockquote>
here is the most astonishing statement—
<br><blockquote><p>"there is no public interest at risk any more than there is any policyholder interest at risk."</p></blockquote>
That is a statement of manifest inaccuracy with which I suspect Conservative Members would not agree.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
There is a public element at risk, yet that speech was made by the chairman of Lloyd's a couple of weeks ago. It is a statement of astonishing self-righteousness and self-satisfaction which I cannot go along with.<br><br>
The Minister's answer to my next question will determine how I vote on the clause. Will the Minister now concede that, as the hon. Member for Dagenham said, there is something wrong that needs to be examined? Surely that is the purpose of the inquiry? Do the Government intend to take steps to strengthen the 1982 Act if necessary? Will the Minister clarify the statement of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch, that whatever the results of the inquiry, Lloyd's will not be brought under the Bill? Moreover, is it true that whatever the results of the inquiry there will be no change in the 1928 Act?<br><br>
If that is the Minister's view, it is very worrying. I shall decide my vote on the clause in the light of the Minister's reply. Will the Minster accept the possibility-— indeed, the probability—that there is something wrong with Lloyd's and that, as the hon. Member for Chichester said, some change in the 1982 Act is the best solution? Will such amendments be introduced? If so, I do not wish to see the amendment accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). If so, I do not wish to see the clause excluded.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, the Minister cannot or will not give those undertakings, I wish to see the clause excluded as an extra point of leverage against the Government. Clause 2(4) enables the Minister to restrict the coverage of the bill by a resolution of the House. That would at least provide us with a point of pressure against the Government.<br><br>
Our approach will depend on the Minister's recognition of the need to do something about Lloyd's. I do not wish Lloyd's to be brought under the Bill per se. On the other hand, if the Government adopt any complacency, we must use whatever instruments we have available—inadequate though they may be—to make them understand the seriousness of the Lloyd's issue.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee must weep for the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown)—even though he used to be in the Special Boat Section—as he is the solitary representative of the Liberal party. He is surrounded by four hon. Gentlemen of formidable physique—even if their intellect does not always match it—but I am sure that his characteristic ability to face in two, if not more than two, directions at the same time, as demonstrated in his latest remarks, will serve him in defending himself against such large numbers.<br><br>
I am not a member of Lloyd's either, and I never have been. I am just as worried as other Committee members about the plight of the Lloyd's names. I am deeply unhappy about the record of Lloyd's as a regulator. Many of its past practices stink.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) rightly referred to Lloyd's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
enormous contribution to the country's invisible earnings. However, that contribution could be in jeopardy if Lloyd's integrity is not re-established under its new regime. The issue is whether the Lloyd's Act 1982 has introduced a sufficiently stringent new regime to end malpractice.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Yeovil has not seen fit, despite his open mind on the issues, to remain in the Committee for more than a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is issuing his press release.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information.<br><br>
Taking the most charitable view about Lloyd's, one can only say that the new arrangements have not yet proved whether they are adequate. I share some of the scepticism that Committee members have expressed about those arrangements. However, the Bill is not the best place in which to introduce fresh legislation. The investor at Lloyd's is different from the sort of investor that the Bill will protect.<br><br>
We should wait for the outcome of Sir Patrick Neill's inquiry, if the Minister will assure the Committee that the Government will give priority to introducing regulatory legislation, if the inquiry finds, or if other evidence emerges, that Lloyd's fails to match up to the standards that we are setting for other investment markets and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank Committee members for their contributions. It has been a formidable debate, which has raised serious questions. I shall deal with them in some detail.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked why we wish to make the exclusion, and, in particular, why we wish to exclude the investment business, rather than the mainstream business, of Lloyd's. He asked whether Lloyd's needs regulation since the introduction in 1982 of the measures and enabling powers of the new regime. Those are legitimate questions for the Committee to consider.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the potential difficulties of the SIB, if Lloyd's were somehow to become an SRO and thus trigger the general provision of the Bill. That should be dealt with in detail.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) for his considered remarks. He gave a clear answer to one or two of the Opposition Members, who implied that we are not being as tough as we should be. We are prepared to be as tough as necessary, but we have to be careful not to damage either the legitimate interests of the two parties that have a serious interest in Lloyd's, or Lloyd's contribution to our invisible income.<br><br>
As usual the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) shot from the lip in Back-Bench John Wayne fashion. T think that he will understand why Conservative Members do not see him as the guy in the white hat, but more the guy who comes out of the saloon, takes a puff of his cigar, sniffs the air for the odd wind of trouble, and marches out to cause it. The hon. Gentleman may be the saloon bar hanger-on but, using parliamentary privilege, he has once again raised many serious questions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) accurately identified the three or four options that may have to be considered—either singly or in combination—in the aftermath of the Neill report.<br><br>
The Lloyd's Act 1982 made important amendments to the structure of Lloyd's. It introduced a council whose members were elected separately by Lloyd's working members and the external names. In addition, distinguished nominated members, to be approved by the Bank of England, were introduced to the council. The Act gives wide powers to Lloyd's, especially the council of Lloyd's, to regulate Lloyd's affairs. Under those powers, Lloyd's has embarked on a major restructuring of the regulatory system. It has made considerable progress but—as it acknowledges—it has not yet completed the task.<br><br>
Under the Act, Lloyd's affairs are regulated in a way designed to protect the interest of names—they are the members of Lloyd's—and the external names directly elect certain members of the council. Lloyd's affairs are also regulated to protect their policyholders. That is the paramount consideration in any system of insurance regulation and something that Lloyd's have done consistently well over a long period. No one has questioned the service that Lloyd's has given its policyholders. There seems to be no conflict in the Committee on that point.<br><br>
Sometimes the interests of names and the interests of policyholders coincide. Sometimes they conflict. What may protect the policyholder may reduce the return available to the name. What may protect the name may reduce the security offered to the policyholder. Lloyd's system of regulation takes into account and balances the protection of policyholders and the protection of names in an integrated way. My Department monitors the way in which Lloyd's policyholders are protected, but our prudential supervision of Lloyd's relies heavily on Lloyd's own regulatory system and is less detailed than our prudential supervision of insurance companies. Let me repeat, Lloyd's record on protection of policyholders has been first class for many years.<br><br>
Serious accusations have been made, which have caused concern on both sides of the House. Members of this Committee and others have made allegations—in the past and to some extent today—against named individuals or have commented on allegations made by others. In some cases, inspectors appointed by the Secretary of State under the Companies Act are inquiring into the matters at issue. In other cases, papers have been referred to the DPP. Therefore, it would be wrong for me to go into the detail and attempt to respond to particular charges.<br><br>
Shortly after the 1982 Act was passed, problems began to emerge which pre-dated the 1982 Act. These problems have given rise to widespread concern both inside and outside Lloyd's. In these circumstances questions have naturally been raised about whether the Lloyd's Act is sufficient or whether some changes are needed in the regulatory system now being established and enhanced. Some Opposition Members have already reached a conclusion on that question and have decided that far-reaching changes are needed. They condemn the 1982 Act because of what happened before 1982— they condemn the regulatory system being established under that Act because of events before it was fully in operation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
We can, fairly and properly—now that the Lloyd's Act has been in force for three years—consider whether that Act, and what has been done and is in the process of being done under it, provides a satisfactory measure of protection for names. Since, in some ways, names at Lloyd's resemble investors in other parts of the financial services sector, it is obviously sensible to use as a yardstick the protection that will be provided under this Bill for those investors.<br><br>
I should tell the hon. Member for Dagenham that we are not contesting whether investment is taking place at Lloyd's but debating the best methodology for ensuring investor protection and meeting the needs of the policyholders.<br><br>
The question that we face is not easy or straightforward. Lloyd's has achieved a lot. It has very wide powers and a constitution which is in some ways flexible and able to respond to developments without further legislation. On the other hand, the pre-1982 abuses which have come to light were very serious indeed. The questions that we face need to be tackled thoroughly and openly. That is exactly why we have set up the committee under Sir Patrick Neill to look at these questions—to examine the protection offered to names under the 1982 Act and to compare it with the protection to be offered to investors under the Bill.<br><br>
We have made it clear from the start that the report will be published—that is an unequivocal commitment. We have also made it clear that we will not hesitate to take action if we conclude that action is necessary, whether by legislation or other means.<br><br>
We have also made it clear from the start that setting up the inquiry should not be seen as showing that we have decided that the 1982 Act and all that has been done under it has failed. Not at all. But Lloyd's, like all other parties will be able to put its case to the committee, which will be able fully to weigh the issues raised.<br><br>
We want to come to a serious and informed judgment on important and difficult questions and we believe that the answers which the inquiry will give will greatly assist in forming that judgment. Let me remind the Committee that this Bill benefits very greatly from exactly such an inquiry that Professor Gower undertook. Very many compliments have rightly been paid to Professor Gower in this Committee and elsewhere. I am sure that we will all be as grateful to the Neill committee for its report.<br><br>
The basic and fundamental issue is whether the present system of regulation of Lloyd's, which is based on the 1982 Act and which balances the protection of policyholders and the protection of names, is adequate. I have explained the Government's position and the role of the Neill committee. We will take whatever action is necessary in the light of that report, whether by legislation or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the view, and I suspect that other Opposition Members would, too, that it has yet to be proven whether the 1982 Act was sufficient to cover the breadth of safeguarding of investment. A large body of evidence says that maybe it is, and I tend to agree.<br><br>
However, one area not in doubt is that element of the 1982 Act which related to investigation and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
enforcement. The inadequacy of that Act seems to have been shown up in the way in which the PCW and other affairs have been looked into, and in the lack of adequate, energetic, early action by Lloyd's to follow through the complaints. That seems to point out the inadequacies of the Act, not in its regulation of current matters, but in how it investigates and enforces.</span></p>
<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the hon. Gentleman to quote the exact numbers I am about to give him—I shall give him the answer in due course—but we have anticipated some of the work by the extra 150 or so staff that we are bringing into the appropriate companies' division of the DTI. The Roskill report is now on its way, and that, too, is aimed at trying to speed up, tighten up and make more effective the investigation of fraud.<br><br>
Moreover, our commitment to legislation, if it is required, is unequivocal. The Prime Minister said that the Government are not just watching events at Lloyd's carefully, but will not hesitate to take any action including legislation that is necessary.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the two ways in which I have responded to him give clear evidence of the Government's seriousness on the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is helpful. However, he has not answered my whole point. The difficulty with the 1982 Act and with the PCW problems is not so much what action can be taken to investigate, enforce and carry through prosecutions, but who is accountable for taking it. That is where the buck stops, and that is what has worried PCW names. The affair was taken to Lloyd's but Lloyd's said, "No, it is the DTI's responsibility." The Minister has told us what the DTI has done to strengthen its forces, but if the line of accountability does not lead directly to the Minister, the argument will fall down as we will never get to the 150 people that have been taken on.<br><br>
Who knows where the buck stops under the 1982 Act? The answer to that question has been indeterminate and unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why the Government were right to give the Neill Committee a very broad remit; it should investigate just that sort of issue. Although we cannot in this Committee lead him, I suspect that the chairman and the members of that committee will find themselves learning from the comments that have been made here by both Opposition Members and my hon. Friends. Those comments may lead the chairman to think that something in the post-1982 regime may need changing, and that the way that the council goes about its business and refers cases for onward investigation should be examined by his committee. I am not tonight trying to tell that illustrious and well respected gentleman how to go about his inquiry, but I shall be surprised if such considerations do not enter his mind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yeovil interrupted me in mid-sentence, I was about to say "and no solutions are ruled out". I hope that that Armageddon end to my sentence will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
Let me set out the very grave reservations that we have about dealing with the affairs of Lloyd's under this Bill, if we do come to the conclusion that major changes at Lloyd's are necessary. These reservations rest on the considerable problems of reconciling two statute-based systems of regulation which would deal with a largely common area from two quite different standpoints, namely the interests of policyholders and the interests of names. These are not merely technical details, but fundamental problems with far-reaching consequences.<br><br>
The Lloyd's Act 1982 reformed the constitution of Lloyd's and gave very wide powers indeed to Lloyd's and its various governing bodies. These powers serve two key purposes. First, and of paramount interest, they protect the interests of Lloyd's policyholders, by, for example, laying down the capital required by names, providing for assets to be held safely in trust funds to meet claims that might arise, and limiting the amount of business that names can underwrite. That protection under the Lloyd's Act 1982 is buttressed by provisions under the Insurance Companies Acts but policyholders protection is the key responsibility of Lloyd's.<br><br>
Secondly, the powers under the Lloyd's legislation also regulate the varying interests of the community of Lloyd's, including the people who provide the capital for the insurance business and stand behind the insurance—the underwriting members. Examples of that are the rules on admission and the recent provisions on what are known as preferred syndicates.<br><br>
It is difficult to distinguish neatly and clearly between those two purposes. It is not a matter of saying that rules about names are for the protection of names and not for the protection of policyholders. That would be obvious nonsense, as it is the assets and resources of names which provide the protection for policyholders, and Lloyd's has detailed rules about those assets and resources.<br><br>
Sometimes, rules and procedures, such as the monitoring of names' overall underwriting exposure, may serve to protect both names and policyholders. What Lloyd's is regulating, under the totality of its powers, is the conduct of business at Lloyd's in the fullest sense, to protect policyholders and members of Lloyd's.<br><br>
Furthermore, I am not aware that anyone has suggested that the powers provided by the Lloyd's legislation are inadequate. They are acknowledged to be wide and were updated only four years ago. That is in almost complete contrast to the financial services sector covered by the Bill, where legislation dated back to the days immediately before the second world war, and where many areas were entirely unregulated.<br><br>
We have, therefore, legislation providing comprehensive powers, vested in Lloyd's governing bodies, enabling them in a consistent and coherent way to protect policyholders and names.<br><br>
What would it mean for that system of regulation, if the regulatory system envisaged by the Bill were applied to Lloyd's; if, in other words, the exemption contained in clause 40 were removed? The problem that would immediately arise would concern the conflicts, potential and actual, between a system aimed solely at investor protection and a system directed at the protection of the policyholders.<br><br>

If we focus on the objective protecting the names, the interests of policyholders can easily be prejudiced where they obtain rights and benefits through the "investment agreement".<br><br>
Obviously—and this is the key point of the hon. Member for Dagenham—we need some mechanism for reconciling the conflicts, but the problem is which mechanism. One answer is to make Lloyd's an SRO, so that the same body is involved, albeit under two different statutory regimes. It seems attractive at first sight, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer. It does not solve the problems resulting from the differences between the two sets of legislation to which I have referred, because what is required of Lloyd's as an SRO may be incompatible with its insurance role.<br><br>
Furthermore, the possibility of conflict remains, between the Bill regulator, and Lloyd's, exercising its powers under the Lloyd's Act 1982, unless we took the surprising further step of laying down that Lloyd's was to be an SRO and could not be de-recognised by the designated agency. But if proponents, relying on Lloyd's as an SRO to limit conflicts, are driven to giving Lloyd's an automatic and unremovable right to be an SRO, what purpose woud be served by bringing Lloyd's into the Bill in such a way?<br><br>
It would do considerable violence—that is a term used by lawyers in that context—to the structure of the Bill, and the relationship between designated agencies and SROs. It would leave the extent of any designated agency's authority and supervision over such a permanent SRO, which as a matter of law could not be de-recognised, in a state of confusion.<br><br>
In short, making Lloyd's an SRO is no answer to the question of how conflicts between the system to protect names and the system to protect policyholders should be reconciled. So what sort of provision would we need to reconcile these conflicts? Hon. Members may have noticed that schedule 8 contains some detailed provisions which reconcile the regulation under the Bill of the marketing of life assurance with the prudential supervision of insurance companies under the Insurance Companies Act. Does that provide us with a guide?<br><br>
The first point to note is that the Bill regulates only a small part of the activities of life insurers, namely their marketing of policies, including surrender and conversion and so on, and perhaps managing their life funds, but essentially a limited part of their activities. By contrast, if the Bill applied to Lloyd's, it would go to the heart of Lloyd's, the way in which names, as members of syndicates writing insurance, are treated and protected. So, the problem of overlap and duplication would be more serious.<br><br>
Secondly, under the marketing of life assurance provisions, the investor and the policyholder are the same person, or the same groups of people. With Lloyd's, names and policyholders are quite distinct. Once again, that makes the problems more severe. Thirdly, schedule 8 envisages that whenever there is a conflict between the protection of the investor under the Bill and the protection of policyholders through the system of prudential supervision by the Secretary of State under the Insurance Companies Act 1982, it should be the latter system that prevails. In other words, crudely, policyholders protection prevails over investor protection. If this is a precedent, then where there are regulatory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
conflicts it points to Lloyd's, as being concerned with policyholders protection, having priority over the Bill regulators who would be concerned with the protection of names. I am not sure that Opposition Members had that sort of arrangement in mind.<br><br>
Surely all hon. Members will agree with what the hon. Member for Dagenham is recorded as saying in <i>The Observer</i> of 15 December:
<br><blockquote><p>"The tricky question is to distinguish Lloyd's role as an insurance organisation already monitored by the Department of Trade's Insurance Division from its investment activities".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps that is a bit of an understatement.<br><br>
Finally, of course, there are all those practical questions which perhaps it is all too easy to overlook. The danger of duplication of monitoring, investigation and enforcement. The problems associated with extending the scope of the Securities and Investment Board, if it becomes the designated body, to cover the Lloyd's insurance market, a point on which Sir Kenneth Berrill has recently considered. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"to bring Lloyd's within the scope of the financial services legislation would introduce a number of extremely difficult technical and practical problems for both Lloyd's and for my board. Put briefly it would mean my board acquiring the expertise to monitor an insurance market which is quite different from the markets in securities and commodities. Both organisations have pretty full agendas at present. Before embarking on such a course we should, I believe, await the outcome of the inquiry to be undertaken by Sir Patrick Neill at the request of the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
There are two more curious aspects of the argument that Lloyd's should be brought within the Bill in order to improve the protection afforded to names. First, the argument amounts to a vote of no confidence in Lloyd's regulatory system. But what will policyholders make of that when their main protection is left with Lloyd's? What will overseas competitors and overseas regulators make of it as well? Secondly, how curious that the Association of Members of Lloyd's, the only body that represents the external members and the very people who would apparently benefit, have come out so decisively against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have refrained from intervening in the Minister's speech. There are so many points which it would have been possible to contest that we might have had an unduly prolonged debate. However, I am sure that the Minster will concede that although the Association of Members of Lloyd's represents a substantial body of Lloyd's investors, there are many outside that association, notably those in the PCW syndicate and those who have also suffered losses, who are profoundly unhappy with the current regulatory sytem at Lloyd's and who have urged me and my hon. Friends to press the case for bringing Lloyd's within the Bill.</span></p>
<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The members of PCW, who have had such a sorry time at the hands of those who abused the privileges vested in them, should be prepared to consider whether—in the post-1982 regime—further improvements should be made in the regulatory regime. I have already told the hon. Member for Yeovil that although I fully appreciate the deeply felt grievances of PCW names, the Committee and Parliament are charged with bringing forward not just a regulatory system on financial services, but a regulatory system which, if required in the light of the Neill committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
conclusions is best to implement those conclusions by whatever means. The Government have not prejudged which method they will use to deliver whatever recommendations the Neill committee makes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to correspondence that we have all received dated 13 February from the Association of Members of Lloyd's. It says that the association has 3,500 members. Perhaps some individuals would support the case in the letter, but we have no evidence that all 3,500 were consulted; indeed, we have no evidence of whether the balance of many thousands of other members of Lloyd's were consulted. Does the Minister accept that the views expressed in the corresponence may be minority views?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that or question it. Hon. Members receive correspondence from many bodies. We accept correspondence in good faith, whether it be from insurance brokers or from trade unionists who, incidentally, can claim to be a similar organisation in writing on behalf of millions of people. The Committee cannot proceed without accepting that those who write to us are acting in good faith when they lobby us overtly or send us information on a personal basis. To do otherwise would cause more difficulties.<br><br>
To bring Lloyd's within the Bill by deleting the exemption in clause 40 rests on the proposition, which has not yet been established and which is to be examined by the Neill committee, that major changes are necessary. It involves choosing a way of proceeding from the options available. That has considerable disadvantages, as I have explained, some of which were mentioned in the excellent contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. The case for retaining clause 40 is overwhelming and I urge the Committee to vote accordingly.<br><br>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) is anxious that you will not miss your dinner, Sir Michael, so I shall not respond as strongly as some of my hon. Friends may have wished to the observations of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham knows that I am not a lawyer, but I am aware that he has considerable expertise in many aspects that we are discussing today. I preface my remarks by saying that I am one of the hon. Gentleman's greatest fans and that if his party had got things right, the right honourable and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) would be Leader and the hon. Gentleman deputy Leader. But the Labour party elects its leaders on far more squalid considerations than meritocracy. I did not think that the hon. Gentleman's heart was in what he said and that he might have been goaded into a position that he did not feel was tenable by the scattergun and rather mixed approach of his hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He had a difficult task as he was sitting next to a Minister who is so much more expert in such matters. The hon. Gentleman's task was no doubt eased by the substantial brief provided by his civil servants.<br><br>
I was also grateful for the Minister's ambiguous remarks at the end of his speech. To those members of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
the Committee who are interested, I am glad to say that I and all my hon. Friends were reselected many months ago by the unanimous vote of our general committees.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that I believe fully in the irresistible logic of my case. I do not propose to delay the Committee. It will be to everyone's advantage if we can proceed to a resolution of the matter by 7.30 p.m., but the Minister was wrong to say that the case for doing away with clause 40 rested on the view that substantial changes at Lloyd's were necessary.<br><br>
All my hon. Friends, and even the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), agree that substantial changes are necessary at Lloyd's, but that is not the basic argument on which the case rests. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) said, the basic argument is one of principle—the principle that Lloyd's carries out investment business. Nothing in the debate has suggested any compelling reason why Lloyd's should be singled out to be excluded from the Bill by specific provisions for its investment business.<br><br>
I do not want to rehearse all the arguments. I was frequently tempted to rise during speeches from both sides of the Committee. I yielded a couple of times while the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) was speaking, but I realised that if I continued in that vein we should take a great deal of time.<br><br>
I shall content myself by saying that I feel as though I were walking through treacle. Almost all the arguments in my opening speech appeared, with all respect to Conservative Members, to be ignored, not understood or not taken on board. I fear that in many cases Conservative Members simply rode roughshod over my arguments as though I had never made them. For example, it was suggested that there was a difficulty with Lloyd's having several tiers of supervision. That system is not unique to Lloyd's but applies to many other bodies which will happily be brought within the Bill.<br><br>
I shall single out one of the Minister's arguments with which Lloyd's would agree and which has some force. It is said that Lloyd's is unusual or perhaps unique in that it has responsibilities to policyholders, who are different from its investors and members. I accept that statement, but I understood the Minister to say that a measure that protects the name—the investor—may reduce the protection available to the policyholder.<br><br>
At first sight that seems a fair statement of the obvious possible conflict of interest in financial terms between the return to be gained by the investor and the amount to be paid out to the policyholder. But on further examination, surely the Mininster appears to be saying that the policyholder's interests might be jeopardised if rules equivalent to the conduct of business rules, which apply to everyone else, were applied to those carrying out investment business at Lloyd's. That is the clear conclusion to be reached from the Minister's remarks. Although the Minister is looking slightly puzzled and doubtful his civil servants are nodding vigorously.<br><br>
That is an extraordinary arrangement. It means that Lloyd's proud claim never to have let a policyholder
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
down appears to rest on the proposition that Lloyd's cannot be expected to safeguard its investors' interests to the degree afforded by the Bill to every other investor. Now the civil servants are shaking their heads, but that is the clear conclusion to be drawn from the Minister's remarks.<br><br>
I do not wish to say more because it would be pointless. The Under-Secretary's ministerial colleague rebuked me earlier for repeating my arguments and I do not intend to do that again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree, given that he has said that that is the central issue of what has been a long debate, that it would help if the Government were to consider an amendment, if not go over the whole debate again, on Report? Then we should be able to debate the matter in a wider context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Yeovil has made such a constructive suggestion. It will carry all the more weight if he votes with us in the Division.<br><br>
We have had a good, but depressing, debate. I do not think that Conservative Members were being wilfully obtuse or that they were deliberately refusing to listen to the arguments. I think that they genuinely believed what they said. However, it was a depressing example of the way in which entrenched positions and political prejudice can prevent hon. Members from reaching a rational conclusion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
That is an unfortunate note on which to end, but I am obliged to say it, because I feel it strongly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obliged to say it, but he does not believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do believe it.<br><br>
For the sake of all those outside the Committee who will want to see how serious we are about the matter, the Division will record who votes in which direction.</span></p>
