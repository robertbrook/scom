<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [16 January], No. 7, in page 2, line 36, leave out the word "may" and insert he word "shall".—<i>[Mr. Buchan]</i></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our previous sitting I said that I welcomed the Minister's statement about the statutory provision of archaelogical services for the first time. There was an exchange about obligations—whether they were mandatory, and so on—and, having read the Committee's report carefully, I now realise that the Minister did not say that there would be an obligation. I kept hearing the word" obligation "; apparently I could not hear the words "not an obligation". I now understand exactly what the Minister said, but that does not alter the Opposition's opinion that there should be an obligation because of the problems that could arise in the future, particularly with regard to funding.<br><br>
Subsection (5) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this section ' London ' includes all Greater London and the surrounding region.'</p></blockquote>
We considered putting down an amendment on that —perhaps simply a probing amendment—but the people in the archaeological service whom we consulted did not want a restriction to be placed on that area of London. However, as the Minister will realise, the extent of the surrounding region raises a number of problems for them. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us the size of the region, assuming that there has been some form of consultation on it.<br><br>
Clearly the museum will be responsible for the provision of archaeological services over an exceedingly large area, which will presumably be larger than the present Greater London council area. There is same sense in that. When the Labour party is in government and re-organises local government in London, we shall have to consider what the extent of the new region will be. Its boundaries could be the M25; it could be larger or, indeed, smaller than that. However, my point about the amendment is that because the area is large and undefined and because there could be problems with funding, we believe that the museum will be tempted to restrict its archaeological investigations and excavations to a smaller area.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
That is another reason for our concern about the preponderance of representation from the City of London. The Minister has stated frequently that with representation should go the responsibility of providing funds. However, there is another side to that, which is that he who pays the piper calls the tune. The payers of the piper might decide that it would be better to concentrate activities within the square mile and the adjacent area. We tabled the amendment to change what is at present a function to an obligation.<br><br>
If the Minister is right in saying that it is a step forward, why not go the whole way? I am not convinced from his arguments that he should not make the quantum leap. To make it an obligation would be an even greater advance and his place in history would be assured. He said that the museum board did not want the overriding obligation. Why? Is there an economic reason? If there is we should be told so now, because that would be a more honest way of putting the Minister's objection.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 38, leave out "and research" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"research and publication".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 16, in page 2, line 42, after "research", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and to maintain a consistent record of sites and monuments in the Greater London area".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 12, in page 4, line 5, after "research'", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and the publication of such investigations and research".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 13, in page 4, line 7, after "research", insert "and the publication thereof".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly because I wish to hear what the Minister has to say about the amendment. It does not tear into the guts of the Bill. It gives an additional duty and makes it clear that publication will take place. It is analogous to our debate last week when we sought to include the word "shall" in relation to the archaeological service. We did not vote against that provision but we may return to it on Report. If we are to have a list, it is better to include what should be done. If we leave anything out it will be assumed that it was not intended. As in any other good museum the duty of publication and its various aspects should be laid down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Richard Luce)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the purpose of the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) in tabling the amendment. It refers explicitly to the power to publish information and by implication it would mean that the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission would have to fund those publications. It is accepted that publications are a standard and important feature of archaeological work, and it is vital that that work is properly written up and made generally available. It could be held that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
power to publish, is implied in the powers to carry out research and investigation and I doubt whether there is any need to provide for a specific power. However, the power to publish is made explicit in other statutes.<br><br>
I do not wish to suggest that publications are secondary to the archaeological research and investigations being carried out. I accept the principle behind the amendments but it would be sensible for me to consider the wording more carefully in the light of that of the Bill. I undertake to come back with an amendment on Report. I hope that is acceptable to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 16, which is in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for New-ham, North-West Mr. Banks), is slightly different as regards the maintaining of a consistent record. Can I take it that the Minister's suggestion about publications also covers that amendment, and that he supports all four amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not commenting on amendment No. 16. I did not realise that the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks referred to it. I assumed that someone else would speak to it, but I accept his point. I shall answer it now if the hon. Gentleman wishes me to do so; if not I am happy to listen further to the debate before doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister said. It is progress and we look forward to the amendment that he will introduce on Report. It is an old archaeological maxim that excavation is not completed until it is published, so we shall be satisfied if the amendment is accepted in the spirit in which it was moved by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Amendment No. 16 touches on a matter that has become tied up with the abolition of the Greater London council.<br><br>
The 1976 joint working party's report "Time on our side? A Survey of Archaeological Needs in Greater London" recommended that an index of sites and monuments be created for the whole of Greater London. The GLC is working in partnership with the Museum of London, the Passmore-Edwards museum and the Kingston heritage centre to develop a Greater London sites and monuments record, which includes both archaeological sites and historic buildings. Given the history of our town, it is remarkable that Greater London was almost the last county to set up such a record and that the collection of data only began in autumn 1984.<br><br>
The sites and monuments records—SMRs—are intended to bring together essential information about known and potential sites in a consistent and easily retrievable form. The main aims are to help assess the known and suspected archaeological evidence; to assist in the allocation of priorities and resources for archaeological excavation and recording; to answer inquiries about planning and land management, a point that I shall return to later; to help meet the information needs for research and publication; and to assist in education and leisure,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
including publicity, exhibitions and the dissemination of information to the general public.<br><br>
The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission is likely to regard SMRs as a key element in the proposed enhancement of the number of scheduled ancient monuments nationally.<br><br>
SMR compilers are employed by the three museums on 12-month contracts and are funded by the Greater London council. Seven staff are working on archaeological data and three on architectural data. There is also a map co-ordinator. Each archaeological compiler covers the area of one unit of the Greater London archaeological service. The department of urban archaeology is collecting its SMR material in the same way.<br><br>
Compilers start with the units' existing records and then move on to other sources, such as national and local journals, aerial photograph collections, museum records and unpublished research and surveys.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Of course, there is a vast quantity of such material in various locations within the present area of responsibility of the Greater London council. I and many of my colleagues at County Hall have been concerned that much of that material will be lost because of the break-up of the GLC into various successor bodies.<br><br>
We are doing our best to rationalise those collections because we do not want to see them disappear. There has been much talk in the media recently about the security problems that County Hall is now having with its heritage collection and records. Some malevolent individuals have tried to suggest that, come 31 March, we shall run with flaming torches down the corridors of County Hall setting the place on fire. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am; relieved to see that the bourgeois hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Dicks) has reappeared to add one more fascinating thought to our proceedings. However, I shall neither run down the corridors with a flaming torch, nor drive down them. The corridor in County Hall that faces Waterloo is the longest straight corridor in Europe; on a pair of skates one could work up a formidable speed before hitting the wall at the other end.<br><br>
I was trying to point out that the GLC has been concerned to preserve these records. In the context of SMR, we were in the process of trying to gather the various information sources together into one coherent whole. Abolition has made that task much more difficult, but I assure the Minister that we shall continue to provide any assistance that we can until 31 March. After that, the task will become the responsibility of the Minister and of those vandals who abolished the GLC.<br><br>
The information that is being gathered is being put into the GLC computer. A special SMR computer system is being devised to ensure that the site details are easily retrievable in a variety of ways— for example, name and address, site type, period, bibliography and archive reference.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
To date, considerable progress has been made. I want to discuss that, and also future plans for the project, although the GLC will not figure in those plans.<br><br>
The design of the computer system is virtually complete. Details of about 5,000 archaeological sites and 10,000 historic buildings have been prepared by the compilers. It is estimated that present staff levels will need to be maintained for at least two more years to complete the basic record. Some staff will be required indefinitely, to update and refine the record and to provide access to it. In due course it is hoped to develop computer graphic systems to assist in the interpretation and presentation of the arcaeological heritage.<br><br>
Naturally, the abolition of the GLC has serious implications for the future of the sites and monuments records, especially in terms of co-ordination and funding. Indeed, the whole future of the GLC computer system is in doubt. That system is integral to> any consideration of the sites and monuments record. So I hope that the Minister will now express some interest in the future of the GLC computer system, even if he has failed to do so in the past. Any concern that he expresses would be best directed to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment.<br><br>
My knowledge of the subject may not be completely accurate. It is becoming difficult to maintain records and find out what is going on now at County Hall because many staff are naturally leaving to try to find other jobs. However, as I understand it, the computer system will be temporarily housed with the London Residuary Body, but it is that body's function to find a home for the system. At the moment, no one knows where that will be. It is one of the most powerful computer systems in Europe, and the thought that it could be broken up is quite tragic.<br><br>
In this Committee, we are concerned with only one small, but vital aspect of the system, and I hope that the Minister will express some interest in that part of the system which relates to the sites and monuments record. He can certainly try to safeguard it. In general, the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission is assuming responsibility for GLC functions relating to historic buildings and archaeology. Statements were made about the maintenance of the computer system during the parliamentary debate on the abolition of the GLC.<br><br>
However, there has been no specific reference to funding for SMR staff. That is causing great anxiety among those involved, but they are only a few of those experiencing such anxiety. Many of their contracts will expire at the time of abolition. My information may have been superseded by events; the Secretary of State for the Environment has a way of making announcements from the Dispatch Box which take everyone by surprise. But, at the moment, it appears that a number of those compilers, for example, who work on the computer system will be declared redundant on 31 March. Much of their work will be jeopardised and their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
skill dissipated. Again, that is a matter in which the Minister should take an interest.<br><br>
Unless the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission shows its immediate intention to fund the work of data collection, there is a strong possibility of losing trained staff to the extent that the future of the project will be threatened. I hope that the Minister can assure me on that point.<br><br>
The SMR has developed in an environment of cooperation between institutions in London, together with enthusiasm on the part of the staff and appropriate funding levels on the part of the Greater London Council and other institutions. It is essential that the Museum of London should be given full powers to continue working with the Historic Buddings and Monuments Commission for the future of archaeology and historic buildings in London. I trust that the Minister will detect from the way that I have explained the amendment that it is not simply a spoiling or probing amendment; it is a straightforward and honest plea to him to ensure that this invaluable record, and the work that has been done so far, is maintained and enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the good spirit that exists in Committee this morning and I hope that it will continue.<br><br>
May I say to the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan), to clarify the position, that I was referring to amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 when I said that I would be prepared to return on Report with an amendment. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, that deals specifically with research, investigation and publication in respect of the archaeological work of the Museum of London.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks)—I was going to call him the hon. Member for the South Bank by mistake—raised amendment No. 16 a separate issue from that of amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13. That amendment would be designed to ensure that the Museum of London maintains a record of historic buildings and monuments in London. If I understand the hon. Gentleman right, he is trying to draw attention to the importance of the work of the GLC sites and monuments record office, and that I readily acknowledge.<br><br>
If, as I am sure it is, the purpose of the amendment is to safeguard the office, it is unnecessary. The Government have already made provision for the office by ensuring its transfer to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, together with the other responsibilties of the GLC's historic buildings division. The record will continue to be available to the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments in connection with its new responsibilty for the survey of London.<br><br>
The work of the office will continue. It is primarily the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. I am concerned with the Museum of London and its responsibilities.<br><br>
It would not make sense to have two sites and monuments offices with records of London. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0546">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
of the GLC is regarded as one of the most comprehensive of any local authority, and the Government appreciate its importance, not only as an academic record but in its day-to-day practical application in land use planning.<br><br>
I can assure the Committee that the future of the office will be safe with the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. The hon. Gentleman described plans for a computer operation and that will help enormously to improve the service. I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment also knows what the hon. Gentleman said this morning.<br><br>
I hope that, given that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will not feel it necessary to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a reasonable debate on the three amendments on research and publication, and a reasonable reply from the Minister. We shall look forward with interest to the amendments that he brings forward. Our amendments were simple, and seemed to us to cover the case, and it would be interesting to know whether they were defective only in drafting, or in achieving their purpose. We shall look at his amendments closely on Report, and I welcome his response.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, Northwest (Mr. Banks) has performed a service to the Committee with amendment No. 16. I listened with care to the Minister's response to it. We are constantly told that an activity is now the responsibility of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, and I hope that the commission will be given sufficient resources, I seem to remember that £7 million additional funds are to be given to the commission for this work, and we hope that it will be enough to allow it to undertake the major task initiated and developed by the GLC.<br><br>
I think that my hon. Friend would agree that we can accept the Minister's assurances on those four points meanwhile, until we see what he brings forward on Report.<br><br>
The Minister said that a good mood is developing in the Committee, and if he continues to move towards us, especially on the new clauses, no doubt the good mood will continue.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 2, line 42, after "research", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"including those services currently provided by the Pass-more-Edwards Museum in Newham".</p></blockquote>
We were encouraged as a Committee to visit the Museum of London. I trust that all hon. Members did so, and it might even be possible to explain the absence of Opposition Members this morning; they may even now be burrowing round in the museum, for they are certainly not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would not wish to mislead the Committee, would he?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should never wish to mislead the Committee at any time. I shall weigh the hon. Gentleman's delphic words and see if they contain something that I should know.<br><br>
We seem to be coming to the end of our considerations on the Bill. We shall soon visit the Passmore-Edwards museum in Newham, which receives tremendous support from my borough. It is a great credit to the museum service in London.<br><br>
It is important to spread our museums out from the centre in the way that the GLC tried to do with the arts generally. Museums are concentrated in the centre of London and there is not much museum and arts provision away from that area, although where it is provided by local authorities it is usually excellent. Nevertheless, we should try to avoid the enormous concentration in the centre.<br><br>
The GLC historic buildings division co-ordinates the Greater London archaeological service with the Museum of London's department of Greater London archaeology, looking after most of London. The Kent archaeological rescue unit acts as agent for the Museum of London in Lewisham, Greenwich, Bex-ley and Bromley, while the Passmore-Edwards museum takes responsibilty for rescue archaeology in north-east London, covering the boroughs of Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Havering, Newham and Barking.<br><br>
Members of archaeological societies in the Greater London area have expressed anxiety that coverage in London will be uneven. That has been the theme running through most of our amendments relating to the provision of archaeological services. We are trying to ensure a more even coverage throughout whatever will be the London area for such services and as defined in clause 2. Archaeological societies fear that because of its funding problems the Museum of London might take a more limited view of its ability to investigate archaeological finds and sites in an area much wider than the immediate location of London.<br><br>
The allocation of available funds is left with the Museum of London with no duty to provide for rescue archaeology in north east London. As one of the Members representing north east London that matter concerns me greatly. Naturally, the Museum of London's department of Greater London archaeology would wish to see rescue archaeology east of the river Lea remain at its present level. However, it is likely that the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission may be under financial pressure, especially in view of its national responsibilities and the additional responsibilities that the commission will have following the abolition of the GLC.<br><br>
If funding for the archaeology services were to be reduced, it would be tempting for the governors of the Museum of London to concentrate resources on the areas for which it is responsible. We want to underline that point. It is not that we suspect the motives of the governors of the Museum of London, but a lack of funding tends to concentrate the mind and in doing so it could concentrate it on a smaller area of archaeology investigation.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
At present, the GLC historic buildings division takes responsibility for administering the £300,000 grant—the 1985–86 level—to the Greater London archaeology service. If there is not to be an independent co-ordinator, protection for the service run by the Passmore Edwards museum should be written into the Bill, with specific powers given to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission and the museum's board of governors. That is a special plea in view of my constituency interest in that part of north east London.<br><br>
Until now things have gone reasonably well. We still do not believe in north east London that we have had our share of the resources. We are not complaining now but rather expressing a considerable fear for the future. I hope that the Minister can allay some of those fears so that I can assure the Pass-more-Edwards museum and people in Newham that archaeological work will not diminish in our part of London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to highlight the part played in the provision of archaeological services in London by the Passmore-Edwards museum and, more specifically, to include the services of that museum in the general services of the Museum of London. I recognise the excellence of those organisations concerned with the provision of archaeological services in the capital. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to provide for the first time a statutory framework for a genuinely London-wide archaeological service, with one administrative focal point.<br><br>
I am glad that this occasion provides a chance to draw more fully to my attention the importance of the work of the Passmore-Edwards museum. I understand that it makes a substantial and vital input to the present provision of archaeological services in the capital. But, I should point out, a number of other organisations and voluntary bodies also do just that. For example, the Kent archaeological unit would represent an important part of me work that is done in conjunction with the Museum of London. It is not the purpose of the Bill to list all those bodies. Indeed, to do so would destroy one of the important features of the Bill, which is to ensure the continuation of a single service with a single objective—the provision of a London-wide archaeological service. I do not intend to fragment that objective.<br><br>
I am in no doubt that the Museum of London will want to continue its partnership with the Passmore-Edwards museum, which has a distinguished history which I have made a point of examining. It was founded in 1900 and has done a great deal of good work over a long period. The Passmore-Edwards museum and all the other interested parties will conceive, with the Museum of London, a programme of archaeological activity for the capital each year. The funding of that programme will need to be discussed with the Historic Buildings and Monuments Committee. To the extent that those activities come within the remit of the Passmore-Edwards museum resources from the Historic Build-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
ings and Monument Commission will pass to it through the Museum of London.<br><br>
I appreciate the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's amendment but I do not think that it makes sense specifically to mention this distinguished museum in the Bill. Let me again assure the hon. Gentle-man that the Bill makes it clear that the Museum of London may have London-wide responsibilities for archaeological services. Its efforts in the past year or two have already demonstrated its commitment to London as a whole. I am confident that it will therefore consider this with great fairness to all the regions of London.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) asked about the funding for the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. The sum of money being made available to it as a result of abolition is £7·75 million. How much goes to this service will have to be decided. There is now a clear public commitment on its part to do that and I am, confident that the Museum of London, with the provision provided for in the Bill, will be able to provide a comprehensive London-wide service. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has moved the amendment because it deals with an important matter. The Minister has not adequately dealt with the problem of ensuring that archaeological services are properly provided for London. I am worried about the services for London.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the role of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, known colloguially as English Heritage. There are great problems with that quango, which is running into chaos in its control of archaeological programmes for the country, let alone those for London.<br><br>
I received a letter from a constituent who is a professional archaeologist. Because of the problems that English Heritage is getting; into, I had to forward his letter not to the Minister for the Arts but to one of the Ministers at the Department of the Environment. Many archaeologists employed on a temporary basis are being sacked and not being re-employed. Other professional archaeologists who were previously employed at the Department of the Environment central unit have not been paid for months on end. My constituent referred to a colleague who had not been paid for nine months.<br><br>
Such non-payment is bad for the employment rights of those employed by the quango and is a grave threat to our heritage and to the programme of archaeological services. I await with interest the reply of the Minister at the Department of Environment to learn whether something is being done to ensure that the quango works properly. However, during the debate it is incumbent on the Minister for the Arts to tell us how the quango is working.<br><br>
Our archaeological heritage is at stake. While those matters are being swept under the carpet no proper archaeological programme is being developed because, post-abolition of the GLC, the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
consider such a programme expedient. The Minister owes the Committee a proper explanation of the chaos that the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission is getting into.<br><br>
The Minister referred to a grant of about £7·75 million. I want to know from the Minister for the Arts or from the Minister at the Department of the Environment whether, as I suspect, the grant was insufficient for a proper archaeological programme, or whether the quango has mismanaged those funds so that it cannot pay its archaeologists for nine months or more. If it is a case of mismanagement the Minister for the Arts is still responsible because he made the appointments to that quango. We need more detailed explanations. That is my key point and it is relevant to the amendment because my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North West is trying to preserve London's archaeological services and to enshrine them in the Bill. At present they are going by the board.<br><br>
I understand that English Heritage is living from hand to mouth and that it cannot pay for a proper archaeological programme. It is waiting for the beginning of the next financial year to effect some sort of bookkeeping transaction to pay people who should have been paid during this financial year. That is not the proper way to develop archaeological services.<br><br>
If the Minister does not give a proper explanation we must safeguard services for London by accepting the amendment. If the Minister does not give us an explanation of how the quango is operating, or a commitment that he will at least do a detailed study of how it is operating, and if necessary provide proper management and additional funds, the Committee should accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One difficulty—which I discussed when we dealt with the "shall" and "may" amendment—is that duties are to be performed under a discretionary heading. The second is that we have an overall responsibility for this duty being passed from the GLC, with its imminent demise, to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. These difficulties underline the correctness of our argument about the discretionary power being made a duty, and the foolishness of abolishing the GLC.<br><br>
The problem with leaving such a matter in the hands of a national body is that it does not have the resources to deal with the concentrated areas of rescue archaeology which often occur. Secondly, the resources allocated have to be handled on a nationwide basis. The existence of the GLC, its relationship with the museum and the archaeological service within London, all add up to a concentration on the needs of London in relation to rescue archaeology. That tendency must be diminished when responsibilty is extended to such a national body. It would have been helpful if the "shall" and "may" amendment had been passed.<br><br>
In the Bill many duties are laid down as being essential, but this is only a discretionary responsi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
bility. That is why this amendment, which brings in the specifics of the Passmore-Edwards museum and its role, is necessary.<br><br>
I have no doubt that the archaeology section of the Museum of London will be keen to do its duty east of the river Lee, but the question is whether it will have the resources. It would be tempting for the governors to concentrate resources on their many statutory duties.<br><br>
Whatever the Government do in the vote at the end of the debate, I hope that they will reconsider this matter, as it is the tip of the iceberg of the problems that could arise. I should have liked protection for the service run by the museum to have been written into the Bill. That is what my hon. Friend seeks when he is not wanting to run with a torch through the GLC building. That was the most astonishing image I had of my hon. Friend, which reminded me of when Alexander of Tarsus, inspired by music and love, seized a torch and put the Persian city to the flames. I hope that my hon. Friend is encouraged neither by lust nor music to take such action.<br><br>
My hon. Friend raised the issue of heritage. When we see Ely cathedral, a building of God, charging for admission we know that the heritage of Britain is in a critical condition. I suspect that the Minister cannot comment on that in the Committee. We have to widen our concept of what must be protected. The size of the congregation nowadays means that imposing such charges is not a good way of protecting our heritage. I do not know what is happening in heaven that such an attitude could develop.<br><br>
Even the additional £750,000–1 thought that my memory was failing when the Minister said it was £7·75 million—is insufficient to fund the specific services provided by this museum and others, and I encourage my hon. Friend to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'> I am grateful to the Minister for paying tribute to the work of the Passmore-Edwards museum. That praise is well-deserved. It is a great tribute to my own borough of Newham that he has been able to give so much financial support to the museum generally. However, that support will be difficult to maintain financially after the abolition of the GLC, and the announcement of the new rate support grant settlement and its impact on the borough of Newham.<br><br>
Obviously, I do not wish to introduce the excitement and intensity that we experienced last night into this sober Committee. I doubt whether there will be any Government defections when we vote on the amendment—as happened after the debate on the rate support grant settlement. However, what took place in the House of Commons yesterday is germane to the amendment because the rate support grant affects Newham adversely. In those circumstances, I hope that the borough and the councillors will be able to maintain the present financial support for the Passmore-Edwards museum. It would be ironic—as the museum is receiving great praise from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
the Committee now—to find that within 12 months it has been hit by a major financial crisis. I am confident that Newham borough council will continue to give its support.<br><br>
Opposition Members are still worried by the fact that the Minister is saying that he is satisfied with the assurances given to him by the Museum; of London—that it will provide rescue archaeology in north east London—and then asks us to be satisfied with those assurances. Again, one does not want to question a person's intentions; we all pass on to other responsibilities subsequently. Assurances as such cannot be enshrined in legislation. We need to have duties written into the clause, which is why we insist on the amendment.<br><br>
No duty is placed on the Museum of London to provide for rescue archaeology in north east London. As one of the Members for that area, I am pushing a specific point because I have an interest in that provision being written into the legislation. I am worried about the future. If something goes wrong in my area of London and I were not seen to be pushing hard, I would be guilty of a dereliction of duty to my constituents and I do not wish to be accused of that.<br><br>
The Minister asked why the Passmore-Edwards museum and that part of London should be singled out. Everyone was free to table amendments. I tabled an amendment relating to an area in which I have a constituency interest, and I do not see why I should be told that the amendment cannot be accepted as no others were tabled about other areas.<br><br>
I recognise the important work, on behalf of the museum, done by the Kent archaeological rescue unit in the south east of London. I do not wish to point fingers but, surely, there must be a Committee Member who represents one of the constituencies in the boroughs of Lewisham, Greenwich, Bexley or Bromley. I shall allow Committee Members to think about that and decide whether they wish to support me. The Minister has not convinced us that the future is assured in terms of the rescue archaeology in north east London. Therefore, I shall ask the massed ranks of my colleagues to press the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 45, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>c</i>) require the referral to them of any application for planning permission or listed building consent which appear to affect their functions by any local planning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
authority in Greater London so that they can- make representations to such authority which shall be considered by the authority in determining such application.".</p></blockquote>
It was my hope that the amendment would have recommended itself to the Committee. It would extend the powers of the Museum of London into planning, which would be a progressive step and would be welcomed by all those concerned about archaeology and the future of listed buildings in London.<br><br>
On several occasions in Committee we have expressed our feelings about the conflict between economic pressures exerted by developers and the need to safeguard our heritage within the capital city. Regularly, stories appear in the newspapers about planning permission being given for buildings and roads which destroy vast areas of history. I realise that this point is obvious, but once the historical record has been destroyed, it cannot be reconstructed. It is destroyed for ever. It is awesome to contemplate.<br><br>
I do not often agree with the heir to the throne, but I agree with him that many of the buildings now being erected in London will hardly be worth looking at in the years ahead. It is sickening to think mat by putting up those buildings we are destroying so much of our history.<br><br>
Because of the conflict we are trying to even things up slightly. It has always been difficult to resist the pressures put on planning authorities by developers. Surely no member of the Committee can be satisified that the balance is correct. The imbalance needs to be redressed. The amendment represents but a small way of redressing the balance in terms of London's history.<br><br>
After abolition of the GLC, the position will be that much worse because London's strategic planning authority will disappear and there will be no strategic planning in London worth talking about. Various groups, semi-quangos and indirect bodies will have responsibility for planning, but they will not have the necessary teeth or the political will to preserve such items.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Perhaps I may recount a story about how the GLC exercised its strategic planning responsibilities in respect of heritage. When I was chairman of the arts and recreation committee, I wanted to replace the Westminster pier, which is a cruddy old pier. I had been assured that it would eventually sink.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Welwyn Hatfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the GLC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but with a much greater loss of life. The pier is potentially dangerous, physically, but its loss would not terminate people's jobs or political careers, however bad that may be.<br><br>
When I wanted to replace the pier because I thought that it was unsafe and unsightly, I was told by the chairman of the planning committee, Mr. George Nicholson, that a new pier would destroy the Canaletto view. Perhaps some hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
do not know about the Canaletto view from Westminster pier. When Canaletto was in London, he stood by that part of the river and looked across and produced a painting of the river viewed from the north side across to what is now the Shell building. Of course the Shell building, an awesome-looking bulk which looks as though it was thrown up in prehistoric times, was not there then.<br><br>
The chairman of the planning committee said that if a new pier were erected, it would destroy that Canaletto view for anyone standing on the Embankment. I stood at that spot and it seemed that if anyone stood on stilts and looked carefully, he would see a square inch of sky slightly to the left of the Shell building. That small area of sky is all that is left of the Canaletto view. The idea that a new pier would destroy the Canaletto view is extreme to say the least because the view has changed so much since Canaletto portrayed it. However, the planning requirements were such that a new pier was not built.<br><br>
That story illustrates how the GLC takes its planning repsonsibilties very seriously—almost to the extreme in some cases. However, when strategic planning is dissipated over London after the abolition of the GLC, less tumultuous considerations will not be taken into account with regard to archaeological sites in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that since piers have been made the responsibility of the Thames water authority by ministerial fiat, that body has shown some interest in developing the river? Proposals for an improved pier at Westminster already seem to be under consideration. But the Thames water authority—private or public—will not be nearly as sensitive as the GLC, which previously exercised planning authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one could be as sensitive about the Canaletto view as George Nicholson when he scotched my proposals for a new Westminster pier. There is now to be a new pier, but I doubt whether the Canaletto view will be taken into account in the deliberations about planning permissions.<br><br>
The continuing conflict between economic interests and London's heritage is now being played out at the Cornhill site of the ancient Roman basilica, which has been described as London s first town hall. As chairman of the GLC, these days I often feel like one of the Roman emperors of old, sitting in splendour while the Goths and Visigoths try to smash down the doors. With London's present town hall under threat, I have some feeling for the fate of its first town hall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has confirmed Conservative Members' belief that he is more like some of the more disreputable Roman emperors than a leader of a modern metropolis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ride in the car provided for the chairman of the GLC. But if the GLC provided me with a chariot, I should insist on having scythes on the wheels. Then I would gallop straight through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
the Government Benches and see what I came up with. But the fact is that many Roman emperors had more fun while the empire was in decay than I am having at County Hall with abolition looming.<br><br>
I return to the question of the basilica at Corn-hill. There has been considerable co-operation between Legal and General and English Heritage on the provision of funds for this, one of the most important excavations in London. We are pleased about that, but English Heritage says that it is still £140,000 short. The Minister could grab a great deal of publicity—something abnormal in our proceedings to date—by announcing that the Government would provide the extra money required to complete the site investigation. It is our money, after all. If he did that, I should be the first to shake him warmly by the hand and say what a good fellow he really was. Perhaps he will give us the good news in his reply.<br><br>
Opposition Members believe that it is wrong to leave the future of archaeological survey and investigation in London to the market or to the developers' good will. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission has many records concerning historic sites in London. If we link those records with the ability of the Museum of London to influence planning decisions on buildings and developments that overlap with a known historical record we shall achieve the co-ordination that is vital to the preservation of our archaeological heritage. I ask the Minister to consider our amendment seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cohen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had a feeling that my hon. Friend was talking to amendment No. 16 rather than amendment No. 17. Those amendments run together as it is important to have a consistent record of sites and monuments in Greater London. That would be an ideal job for the Museum of London. When planning authorities consider planning applications the record will be available for consultation.<br><br>
I was a planning committee chairman in Waltham Forest. Sadly there were only a few voices in favour of conservation. Others saw the need to develop and improve and sought to allow market forces to go ahead. They genuinely wished to keep updating our cities and create jobs. However, it is important that someone speaks for conservation in such committees.<br><br>
The amendment would give that opportunity when planning authorities consider application for development and building consents. It provides that local authorities must consult with the board of the Museum of London to discover whether there are archaeological or historical consequences in granting planning permission.<br><br>
It is important to place that duty on local authorities because some do not consult properly but do the minimum. They should be asked to consult and the Museum of London should consider its role seriously in giving information about historical London to all the planning committees before they make their decisions.<br><br>
Let me give a couple of examples of a lighter kind. Leytonstone, which I represent, is the birthplace of Alfred Hitchcock, the famous film director.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
Sadly, the house where he was born has been knocked down and a garage put up in its place. The committee did not know that Hitchcock had been born in the house until it had been knocked down. While I am not saying that we should have stopped it from being knocked down, I feel that sort of provision should have been made for the site to be recognised. Perhaps a plaque could have been put up.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
A proper museum concerned with London history can tell the planning committees, if it has a duty to consult them, about the historical consequences of such actions. I nearly said that whoever was responsible for knocking down the house should have been given the "Psycho" treatment—but no doubt I would have got the "Bird" from the Committee. So I shall avoid further appalling Hitchcock puns.<br><br>
The other example is one that I see when I come into the House via Islington, where the GLC has put up a plaque commemorating Mr. Thomas Crapper, inventor of the modern flush lavatory. Perhaps we should not go into that in too much detail. But there are many more examples of famous people who should at least be acknowledged, and the planning committees ought to consider such relevant aspects of Londons history before they make irrevocable planning and building decisions and destroy any chance of honouring them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West has said, vast areas of history can be destroyed in that way.<br><br>
I feel that amendment No. 17 is very reasonable, and I hope that the Minister and the Committee will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced by the arguments of my hon. Friends, partly because I know something of other cities. Strangely enough, I know the archaeology and history of one or two of them better than I know that of London. In the past, for instance, I have had a certain involvement with Rome, and the position is very similar there. Of course, it is enormously difficult in Rome, because it is impossible to dig an underground tunnel for a yard without running into something, but the same applies in a more limited way in London. I shudder when I travel through the City, because we have destroyed so much of it. And we should remember that the City is part of the board of governors of the museum.<br><br>
We are only asking for referral and consideration. Surely that is not asking too much. Developers in the past have moved rapidly to prevent parts of London being saved. Something is dug up with an excavator, and the foreman says, "For God's sake keep moving before someone tries to stop us." It could almost have happened in York, but fortunately there were enough people with sense in the area to hold up that development until the site had been saved.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
The power that we are asking for is discretionary, in that the board "may" require such a referral, and in that it will do no more than make representations which shall be considered. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance, even if he cannot support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It shows the Committee's remarkable ingenuity that in a debate on amendment No. 17 we should range from issues such as Roman emperors to Alfred Hitchcock. That is an astonishing combination. At one point, excitement took over the Committee when we talked about Roman emperors but I must get back to slightly more mundane matters.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to give the Museum of London the power to require local planning or listed building consent which affect its functions.<br><br>
I want to stress that arrangements exist already whereby archaeological interests are fully taken into account. In cases of demolition of listed buildings, local planning authorities already have to consult with the Council for British Archaeology and with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions of England. In addition the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission is already notified of listed building consent applications in the case of the most important buildings. On the abolition of the GLC the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission will be directly involved in all listed building consent cases in London.<br><br>
Over and above that, local planning authorities are free to consult whomsoever they wish in connection with applications, and other bodies may respond in the light of the advertisement of relevant proposals. None of this will change as a consequence of the abolition of the GLC.<br><br>
I have received no representations from the Museum of London whereby it consider that archaeological interests are not adequately safeguarded under existing planning procedures or that it will be more at risk after the abolition of the GLC.<br><br>
Local planning authorities have to take into account many different factors in the determination of planning application and listed building consent applications. The archaeological implications are just one of the factors involved. These are already safeguarded and will continue to be safeguarded. I say strongly to the Committee that there is no need for any additional statutory safeguard.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that reply and the explanation of the way in which the procedures will ensure that there will continue to be adequate safeguards in the future.</span></p>
