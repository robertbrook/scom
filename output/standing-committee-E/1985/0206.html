	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [4 February], That this schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying on Tuesday when the Committee adjourned that the sale of the business of a company or of its assets would not itself constitute investment business, but if shares were sold, a transfer agent whose business was arranging such transactions would be carrying on investment business and would be required to be authorised. We are giving further consideration to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked about the issue by a company of its own shares. This is excluded from the definition of investment business by virtue of paragraph 23(3), but a merchant bank that arranged the issue would be carrying on investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) asked about unitised property schemes. They would fall within the definition of a collective investment scheme in clause 67. He also asked whether the exclusion for certain transactions between building societies in paragraph 18 would continue to apply if a building society were to convert itself into a limited company, as is envisaged in the consultative document that was published at the same time as the Building Societies Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will appreciate that the deadline for comments on that consultative document has only just passed and the Government have not yet announced their detailed proposals. The consultative document suggested that a building society that converts in this way to limited company status would cease to be a building society and to be regulated as such. Instead it would need deposit-taking authority under the Banking Act 1979. That would leave its position in relation to paragraph 18 unchanged, because that paragraph treats institutions authorised to accept deposits on the same basis as building societies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER TO EXTEND OR RESTRICT SCOPE OF ACT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 2, line 18, leave out from " section " to " shall" in line 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 50, in page 2, line 31, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment touches on a matter that is important in terms of die powers that we vest in Parliament or in the Secretary of State. A central issue that has been raised previously concerns the powers given to practitioner regulation and those given to transaction regulation. That balance is the subject of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two different ways to change the Bill; to extend it or to restrict it and subsections (2) and (4) concern the procedures that die Secretary of State must follow. Subsection (2) lays down what he must do if he wants to extend it and, as I understand it, subsection (4) states how he would go about restricting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with the procedure laid before the House. Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" An order under this section which extends the meaning of investment or extends the activities that aire to constitute the carrying on of investment business shall be laid before Parliament."</p></blockquote>
On the other hand, subsection (4) states clearly that, if the Minister wishes to restrict that, it is subject to the negative resolution procedure. That is the wrong way round. Subsection (4) states that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament ".</p></blockquote>
To the layman, or those who may be watching or reading about our proceedings, that may have a ringing tone to it. It may mean to them something which we in the House know that it does not mean. To the layman, it sounds as though it is subject to careful safeguards, but, unhappily, we know that that is not true. In fact, it hands almost total power into the hands of the Executive. The Government may lay an order restricting the scope of the Bill, and we have to table a prayer within 40 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When that procedure was introduced into the House—you, Sir Michael, will remember that better than I, as a relatively new hon. Member—we automatically debated matters under the negative procedure on the Floor of the House. As I understand it, provision was always made for debate and there was frequently discussion far into the night. However, all Governments—not only this Government—take steps to limit such procedures available to Back-Bench Members when they are operated too effectively and the protest is too strong. That has happened in diis case. At best, we shall have a debate on the Floor of the House lasting about an hour or an hour and a half; indeed, those debates now have to finish at 11.30 pm. We may not even have a debate on the Floor of the House: the matter is often relegated to a Standing Committee, but there is no guarantee of even that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
However let us assume that we are lucky and that such a statutory instrument is brought before a Standing Committee. What happens then? We vote on it at the end of our deliberations. Let us assume, for example, that the Secretary of State wishes to restrict substantially the powers of the Bill in such a way that it excites even the opposition of Conservative Members. We may, therefore, have a vote and the Committee may decide to vote against the statutory instrument. Indeed, it may decide " not to consider " that instrument to limit the Bill's powers. What happens then? The Clerk of the House has to report back to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that those are perhaps matters with which the Select Committee on Procedure could deal? That might help him in his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but they have not been dealt with by the Select Committee. We must use the present procedures and judge the Minister's actions in relation to the present powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negative procedure provides us with no safeguards in seeking to limit the Secretary of State's power. That is important because the position is the reverse of what it ought to be. The Minister must come before the House if he wishes to extend the Bill, but, at present, he can reduce its effect almost at will without a reasonable checking pro-, cedure. It leaves far too much power in the hands of the Secretary of State. We would prefer to see matters reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wished to extend the scope of the Bill by statutory instrument—although he may not like that—we would accept that more readily than that he should use that mechanism to restrict the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment ensures that, whether the powers are extended or the scope of the Bill is restricted, the Minister must come before the House of Commons. That gives an appropriate level of accountability in the Bill. We think it wholly inappropriate that the power of the Executive should be greater in restricting the scope of the Bill than in extending it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Opposition did not table an amendment on the lines of amendment No. 49, but I have some sympathy with the general argument of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). I do not think that an amendment is required here, but it is useful for him to have drawn attention to the way in which clause 2 is drafted which betrays, perhaps inadvertently the Government's balance of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Yeovil said an extension of the ambit of the Bill will require a formidable parliamentary procedure, whereas a restriction will not. That suggests that the Government feel that an extension of the Bill, which would arguably be against the interests of practitioners is regarded as important, whereas a restriction, which ought to be equally important to investors who need protection,
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
will require less parliamentary supervision. Why has that distinction been made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic is simple and straightforward. We accept that Parliament must have the opportunity to consider proposals to extend or restrict the Bill by means of an order under clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept that where die effect of die order is to extend die scope of the Bill, so that it might affect people not previously affected, it should be subject to affirmative resolution procedure. Parliament should have to make a positive decision to widen the scope of the law and to bring within it those people who were otherwise outside it. Parliament will also have the power to annul an order restricting the scope of the Bill, but it does not seem necessary or desirable to require that Parliament must in every case formally consider an order of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem to have taken the point. He is looking at the provision entirely from the viewpoint of practitioners and the impact of extension or restriction on them. He is not looking at the provision from the viewpoint of investors. A restriction of the Bill could leave unprotected investors who have hitherto been protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the general principle outlined by the Minister: to extend the law is a matter of greater moment than to restrict it. Nevertheless, the hon. and learned Gentleman seems to have paid no attention to the argument of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) which is worthy of consideration. A restriction of the ambit of the Bill may be of considerable importance to investors who have hitherto been protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) put the argument very neatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has explained the position, but has given us no reasons. He must recognise that the Bill provides certain protections to investors. The reduction of the ambit of the Bill is therefore as important as its extension. In either case, people are affected: those involved in investment business in the City of London would be affected by the extension of the Bill, but, by precisely the same argument and the same logic, those who enjoy safeguards under the Bill would be equally affected if the safeguards were removed or diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has merely said what will happen, but has given no reasons why he has more specific and freer powers to remove from the Bill the safeguards for investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is serious about these two vital purposes, giving on the one hand to the City of London an appropriate degree of freedom to allow it to operate efficiently, and, on the other, giving small investors the assurance of safeguards, he must treat any changes to the Bill, affecting one or other side, in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of considerable principle and I ask the Minister most sincerely to explain why he views
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
the two sides differently and why we should not conclude that his real purpose is to give as much freedom as possible to those who operate the services of the City of London and not, as he claims, to safeguard investors. If the Minister cannot provide reasons and will not reconsider, many of us will draw that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too prone to dissenting from the general view of the Opposition side, but there may be a valid point here. By extending the Bill, one moves into new areas and there is a consultation process to be carried out to ensure the widest possible debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one restricts the effects of the Bill, surely one does so on the basis of experience after consultation, so such restrictions require a different status of Government response. That is the answer in more simple terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contribution from the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours) was a splendid example of those cross-party alliances, to which so many members of the Committee were looking as the Bill progressed. The hon. Gentleman has said all that I wished to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a general principle here, and it was also referred to by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). That is why the procedure in the Bill is appropriate course to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>OFFENCES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 3, line 12, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) If a justice of the peace is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that, at any such premises as may be specified in the information, a person has any documents or other material in his possession which may be evidence of the commission of an offence under this section, the justice may grant a warrant under his hand empowering any constable to enter the premises, if necessary, by force, at any time or times within one month from the date of the warrant, and to search for, and seize and remove, any such documents or material found therein.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4) Any document or other material seized under this section may be retained for a period of one month or, if A 3

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 106, in clause 44, page 29, line 3, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The provisions of section 4(3) and (4) above shall also apply to this section in the case of any suspected offence under this section.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 107, in clause 52, page 38, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12) The provisions of section 4(3) and (4) above shall also apply to this section in the case of any suspected offence under this section.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 108, in clause 156, page 121, line 14, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) The provisions of section 4(3) and (4) above shall also apply to this section in the case of any suspected offence under this section.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be immediately apparent to those familiar with this area of the law that the amendment would introduce into clause 4 the same provision that it was thought necessary to include in section 14(8) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, so that where it was suspected that an offence had been committed there were powers to provide a warrant for search and entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments propose to extend that provision to clauses 44, 52 and 156, which also create criminal offences. Indeed, there may be other criminal offences where such a provision would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the Minister or his draftsmen intended not to provide such a general power. The Minister may be able to' point to some other provision that achieves that objective, but will he explain why, on the face of it, the power does not exist and will he, therefore, accept the sense of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government take the general view that it is desirable to keep to a minimum the statutory provisions that give the police or other authorities the right to enter and search private premises. The amendments would enable the police to enter die premises of an entirely innocent person and seize documents there when it was suspected that another person had committed an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental issue, however, is whether there should be a right of entry to any premises. Clause 92 already enables the Secretary of State to require the production of documents from any person so that he may investigate someone who appears to be carrying on investment business. Although there is no right of entry to premises, anyone who fails to comply with such a request without a reasonable excuse would be guilty of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we believe that the power in clause 92 is sufficient for those purposes, we do not regard the power of entry as being necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am dismayed at what the Minister says. I had assumed, perhaps optimistically, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
the matter had escaped his attention or that he would concede that the provisions of the 1958 Act would be appropriate for this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems extraordinary, in a Bill designed to tighten the rules, and in a climate where there is much anxiety about the lack of effectiveness in the criminal law and the difficulty of obtaining evidence about the commission of an offence of the type that we are discussing, that the Minister can tell the Committee that he deliberately proposes to restrict a power of entry and search that was thought to be necessary in 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has changed between 1958 and today to render that change in the legal provisions acceptable? The overwhelming evidence seems to be that the change that has occurred—it has been substantial—has been in the opposite direction: there is now a much greater need for enforcement powers, detection powers, speed and effectiveness, in obtaining evidence. The Minister is right to draw attention to clause 92, but the powers in that clause fall far short of the type of power which was not invented by me and my hon Friends, but is in the 1958 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that the Minister has made a case for weakening the power of those whose job it is to enforce the criminal law. I hope that he will enlighten us further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee does not wish to be wearied by repetition of the arguments. Essentially, clause 92, to which there was no precise equivalent in the 1958 Act, gives power to require the production of documents. If those documents axe not produced, an offence is committed. Having regard to the introduction of that power and to whether in those circumstances it is necessary to give police or other authorities the right to enter and search premises private premises, and also in the light of the general principle that such provisions should be restricted to a minimum, the view is taken that it is not necessary to confer such a right in all the circumstances that we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a self-evident view, capable of being disputed but not of benefiting from prolonged dissertation upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to prolong the debate unduly, but what the Minister has said evinces a touching faith in human nature which does him great credit. Surely, he more than most must recognise that, when we are legislating on issues of this sort and trying to impose criminal law sanctions on offenders, we are legislating not for persons who will be acting in good faith, but for persons at the extreme who will be determined to avoid the rules laid down in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be an offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, but clause 92 is no substitute for the power of the police—with all the proper safeguards of obtaining a warrant and so on —to knock on the door and say that they have come to search the premises because they have reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been com-

mitted under the Financial Services Act. Clause 92 will provide little safeguard against the ruthless and determined criminal who will say, when he receives a notice, " Thank you very much for letting me know that you are interested in this range of documents. I will now see what I can do to muddy the waters and cover my tracks." Recent experience has shown the difficulty of bringing the criminal law —and, indeed, any other regulatory system—to bear in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the Minister has spent the many months looking at the Bill in a genuine effort to make the system work. But I cannot believe that he can countenance a relaxation of the existing rule in such a crucial area, on which so much will depend when enforcing the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). The issue that is causing widespread concern in the City is whether the Bill will have sufficient powers of protection and enforcement once it has become law. That is the point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are saying, as far as the Roskill commission is concerned, that they will tamper with the jury system. That is something to which I take exception, unless it can be proved that there is no other way of presenting complicated cases such as fraud. The Government are also now limiting police powers to discover whether evidence can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's opposition to the amendment is astonishing. I am glad that the hon. Member for Dagenham has said that he will press the matter to a vote. The extent to which we are prepared to provide people with the powers to obtain information is a central issue. It is extraordinary that the Government are prepared, on the one hand, to tamper with the jury system, on the Roskill commission recommendations, but on the other hand, they will not ensure that the police have reasonable means at their disposal to obtain evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He feels that fraud is a slight on the City and on reputations of those people with integrity who work there. During our conversation it was clear that Sir Nicholas supported the Roskill recommendations because he supports that strengthening of the legal system. I do not go so far.

The police hold this power under the criminal law, and it is vital. We have seen it exercised perhaps not too well, in the Johnson Matthey Bankers' scandal. We saw the need to obtain documents from Mr. Mahmoud Sipra, and in the end the police exercised the kind of powers that my hon.

One of the problems in the case of Mr. Abdul Shanji has been the constant movement of documents on the Arya holdings from one part of Jersey to another, and one of the difficulties with Mr. Michael Hepker has been obtaining the documents.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Too much is being made of the distinction between the powers in clause 92 and the entry powers that the amendment seeks to provide.

If, without reasonable cause, the request is not complied with, a criminal offence will have been committed. That power was not provided in the 1958 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, a number of questions have been raised by Opposition Members, particularly by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) with his constructive contribution.

and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>" any interest, dividends, profits, or other return on any such money or on investments made with such money/'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment covers a small point. Perhaps the Minister will be able to assure me immediately that it is unnecessary. Clause 5 deals with two types of agreement on which the court may make orders to reduce the impact of illegality. First, there are the agreements entered into by those who are not authorised, and who are conducting investment business in contravention of the provisions of clause 3. The second type of agreement is entered into by those contravening other provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the first type of agreement—that entered into by those not authorised to do so. The Bill identifies two conditions on which the court might be prepared to take such action as the clause provides; first that the person did not know that he was authorised, or was unaware that he was breaking the law, and secondly, that he had acted substantially in accordance with the rules and principles that were laid down elsewhere in the Bill. I contend that the exemption is too widely drawn because it is simply a matter of belief. It asks the person concerned to show a reasonable belief that he was not breaking the law, whereas surely we are entitled to expect that he should have taken reasonable care. After all, it is a matter of conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that this extra element should be met before the court provides exemptions for illegality? Perhaps the Minister can assure me that the amendment is unnecessary, but I find it odd to have a requirement on belief rather than of conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael, and to the Minister for drawing my attention to a misplacing of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 118 concerns a different point— the right of a person under an agreement that is invalid to recover property or money paid. The clause provides that he should be entitled to do that and receive interest on the money that he has paid over. The meaning of the amendment is clear; it is to extend the provision so that dividends or other returns or investments represented by that money should be returnable in appropriate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important, because circumstances may arise where the investment made has declined in capital value and where it would be unfair to return with interest, the investment—money or property paid—to the person who was disadvantaged by the arrangement. It would be fairer to allow a return, dividend, or other fruit of that investment to be retained by the person who should not have entered into the arrangement. I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at the widening of the ambit of the provision. I believe that the provenance of the ambit is the Law Society of Scotland, which believes that this is an important widening of the provision. I was persuaded by its argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I do not fully understand the import of the hon Gentleman's observations. I am advised that the clause would not give effect to the representations that have been made by the Law Society of Scotland on this point, but the issue gives rise to what I may describe as the modest point of principle that although it may seem reasonable for money that has been used in the way discussed to be returned with interest, it would extend the principle if dividends, profits and so on were also returned. The question whether a profit has been made from an investment is largely a matter of chance for the investor. It is difficult to understand why the sum that he can recover should depend on chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the unauthorised person has made a significant profit on the transaction, the powers in clause 6 will enable the Secretary of State or the designated agency to seek disgorgement of that profit by court order. The investor is safeguarded sufficiently by
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
the return of interest. For those reasons, the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content with the Minister's explanation. I cannot agree that the amendment would extend the principle as far as the Minister suggests, but I take his point about the implications of clause 6 and the important power to compel disgorgement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct an earlier error? The power in clause 6 is restricted to the Secretary of State. My reference to the designated agency was erroneous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding that point, I am content with the Minister's general explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and took reasonable care to ensure".</p></blockquote>
I shall not weary the Committee by restating my earlier case, but I trust that the Minister was sufficiently unbemused by the inappropriateness of my remarks to have followed my argument. To briefly recap, I suggested that it seemed a little odd for clause 5(3)(a)(i) to limit the relevant criterion to a matter of belief when we would normally require reasonable care in the course of conduct. Will the Minister explain why that element has been excluded from the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstances in which agreements made by unauthorised persons in the course of investment business can be enforced are limited. Not only must the person have reasonably believed that he was not behaving illegally, but he must have substantially complied with any relevant conduct of business rules. The investor must not have been put at risk by an inadvertent contravention, and must have been treated fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances the present requirement of reasonable belief is not easily satisfied. Someone who is merely negligent and who fails to check whether he should be properly authorised under the Act will not have a defence. The court will make an objective judgment, testing whether any reasonable person could have concluded that he did not need to be authorised, and not whether he was so unaware of his responsibilities that he overlooked the need to be authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment adds little. It may be intended to make more contracts unenforceable, but unscrambling such contracts would be a rather messy business, to be undertaken only when absolutely necessary, in the interests of investor protection. The existing defences in the clause cannot be used by those who flout the Act and who put investors at risk. Agreements entered into in such circumstances must and will be unscrambled, but agreements entered into under genuine misapprehensions, and which were performed properly, substantially in accordance with the conduct of business rules, should not be jeopardised by extra burdens of proof, which will not add to investor protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am worried that that and one or two other provisions divert attention from the need to secure authorisation.

There is only a small margin between the Minister and me, but I moved the amendment to ensure that maximum pressure to gain authorisation will be put on a person who wishes to carry out investment business.

The object of the Bill is investor protection. However if an investment business is unable to enforce its transactions because it has transgressed in some way, the effect may be to reduce genuine investor protection by giving an uncovenanted bonus to a loss-making investor whose debts cannot be enforced; and even perhaps thereby so weakening the business that it is forced into liquidation and debts to other investors go unpaid."</p></blockquote>
He went on to refer to the Banking Act 1979, which does not render contracts unenforceable at civil law. He dealt with a case in court last summer in which one of the parties tried to argue, none the less, that the disputed contract should be held to be unenforceable.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon and learned Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire was worried about clause 5, which makes some transactions unenforceable, and other clauses that create criminal offences at common law,
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
making, it may be argued, the transactions unenforceable. What is the consequence in civil law of the creation of those criminal offences?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important point, as we do not want unscrupulous people to be able to take advantage of the provision—which is intended to protect investors —to damage the interest of those investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed that important matter with my hon and learned Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Lyell), whose long and detailed letter I shall answer in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point, however, which was referred to by my hon Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) in his intervention, is that all that the provision ensures is that, if someone enters into a transaction when he should have been authorised to carry it out, but had no reason to believe that he was authorised and, furthermore, did not substantially act in accordance with conduct of business rules, he should not be able to benefit from any profit that he might make from that transaction. That is the principle underlying the clause.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with a small point, as the Minister will see at once. He will be familiar, as many of us are, with the difficulties of seeking to prove criminal offences where actual knowledge is required. It is sometimes a great problem, despite all the circumstantial evidence that may surround a particular instance, to show that a person knew of a certain set of facts or material circumstances. It is the almost invariable practice to include in the concept of knowledge that of constructive knowledge. It is to secure that objective that I seek to insert the words " or recklessly ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the general point put by the hon. Member for Dagen-ham (Mr. Gould) but, in deciding whether it should be applied to certain circumstances, one must consider how its application would work. The person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
who enters into a transaction in breach of clause 3 is the principal culprit and it will normally be that person who should take steps to unwind the transaction. We have also included a third party who is " knowingly " concerned in the contravention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would bring in a third party who was reckless as to whether he was concerned in a contravention. For example, that would include a person who bought shares from an unauthorised person without questioning whether the unauthorised person had obtained them in contravention of the law. That would, I believe, be an unduly onerous extension, requiring people to check in that way whenever they bought shares. An unauthorised person is permitted to deal on his own account, and there is no reason why a person buying shares should have to check whether the seller is authorised, or whether what for him is a bona fide transaction would involve him in a contravention of clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, however meritorious the general principle on which the hon. Member for Dagenham has relied, we think it inappropriate to extend it to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister was speaking, it occurred to me why he might be attached to the formulation in the Bill rather than to the wider wording that I suggested. Where, for example, the question was when a particular person knew about the leak of a letter, one can see that if the requirement were " knowingly ", a certain explanation might suffice but, if it were " recklessly ", it would be more difficult to get away with that explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That instance in many ways exactly illustrates my argument, and I take it that the Minister has some sympathy with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that, if we wanted to get away with that matter, we would send someone to a Select Committee of this House to give hearsay evidence which had no probative value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr.Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I could have an interesting conversation on the further ramifications of that point, but you, Sir Michael, might not look kindly on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister expresses general sympathy, he is bound to concede that there may be a case in which someone deliberately averted his gaze, as it were, and failed to ask. In that case, it would be difficult to show that he knew that he was dealing with an unauthorised person, but, in the circumstances, one would be bound to say, " Surely you must have asked; you had a duty to ask yourself." As the provision is drafted, a person in that category would escape. I suspect that the Minister supports my belief that he should not escape and, given that the amendment is so small, perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman might reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be entirely consistent with the example upon which the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister's last remark entirely conceded my case, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, page 5, line 7, after " section ", add
	<br><blockquote><p>" 3 above or of section ".</p></blockquote>
In a sense, the amendment is directed at a similar point to that which we considered in amendment No. 14. Again, it is intended to focus attention on the importance of securing authorisation under the provisions of clause 3, and not simply on complying with the conduct of business rules, by which an authorised person might be expected to abide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, under clause 5, an injured party—someone drawn into an agreement with an unauthorised person—may recover money or property paid or transferred. But under the provisions of clause 6, he is entitled to recover for loss only in the cases where there has been a specific breach of the provisions of, say, clause 44, and the conduct of business rules, rather than in cases where he is simply dealing with someone who is unauthorised in general terms under clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 6(3)(6), we are struck by the omission from the list of revisions of an offence under the provisions of clause 3. That leaves me rather puzzled. It is unfortunately if it is implied that the obtaining of authorisation under clause 3 is of lesser importance than it ought to be. I ask the Minister to comment on that simple point, and I hope that he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause already covers cases where the business has made a profit and cases where the investor has suffered loss because of misconduct in the way the business has dealt with the investor. Restitution orders may be sought in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable a restitution order to be sought where a business, albeit unauthorised, has behaved propertly towards the investor and made no profit out of him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not part of the general approach behind the Bill to compensate investors for normal commercial loss, where no misconduct towards the investor is involved. Contravention of clause 3 may occur inadvertenly because, for example, of the complexity of the definition of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members would like to suggest other types of misconduct which could be added to the list in subsection (3)(fc), I would consider such suggestions. But losses resulting exclusively from contravention of clause 3 should not be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is obviously a much more substantial point than that raised previously by the hon.

He may shake his head, but I believe that it has that effect.

We believe that registration is very important and to make it possible to claim compensation for losses in the event of non-registration would reinforce the importance of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am

If the Minister does not accept the principle involved here, non-registration will be less significant in terms of the damages that can be claimed against it than it might otherwise be and the importance of the various registration bodies, the SROs, will also be diminished. I take his point about the unknowing aspect of failure to register because of a technicality, but it would not be difficult to add some words to the effect that there would have to be a deliberate avoidance of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Non-registration should be an offence at least equivalent to those that occur under clauses 44, 51 or the conduct of business rules. The Minister should address himself to that point rather than to the nit-picking one of saying, " What happens if somebody does it unknowingly?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am unhappy about the Minister's response, because he suggests that the importance of securing authorisation under clause 3 is of minimal weight. It would be unfortunate if what he said and, indeed, the way in which the provision is drafted, were to leave that impression. His point about inadvertance is not a strong one; the thrust of this part of the Bill should be that the obligation for securing authorisation rests on the person who wants to carry out investment business. If he failed to obtain that authorisation—and I accept that there might be difficulties—any balance of advantage between him and another person with whom he were dealing would have to go against the person who, for whatever reason, had not obtained the authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister does not intend the provision to have the effect of diverting attention from the importance of obtaining authorisation, but that is the way it reads. It is not worth pressing the matter to a Division, because I am sure that the Minister has thought about it and I hope that he will think about it further in the light of the debate. I urge him not to allow it to be believed that authorisation is a hurdle that has to be jumped in certain circumstances but if, for whatever reason, someone avoids it, provided he is a good boy, he is in the same position as someone who obtains authorisation. That would weaken the structure of the Bill. The Minister is shaking his head: it would be helpful if he could reassure us on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether what I shall say will be reassuring or not. This provision is not intended to minimise the importance of obtaining authorisation to carry out investment business. I reiterate the point that dealing without authorisation would be a criminal offence under the Bill and that is a measure of the fundamental importance that we attach to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

What is at issue here is whether an unauthorised person who enters into a transaction, as a consequence of which someone suffers a loss, should be obliged to reimburse that second person for the loss even though there has been no substantial breach of the conduct of business rules and where there has been nothing improper or unfair. In those circumstances, where someone purchases shares from an authorised person which then go down in value, the loss is a purely commercial one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal of the hon. Member for Dagen-ham (Mr. Gould) would encourage people to buy shares for unauthorised persons in the knowledge that if the value of the shares subsequently went down they could obtain restitution orders simply because the person from whom they bought the share was unauthorised. It does not make sense that the person should be able to obtain a restitution order merely because the person selling the shares was not authorised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Asdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is indulging in sophistry when he says that the amendment would encourage people to buy shares from unauthorised persons. Surely he would agree that it would increase the sanctions on those who were unauthorised. There would then be fewer of diem and thus less temptation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to tempt me into the outer fantasies of hypothetical argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example that I gave is a genuine one and would certainly be a consequence of the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister suggested that the amendment might encourage people to deal with unauthorised persons, he overlooked the provisions of clause 6(2). If he wishes to rely on that point, he might reconsider amendment No. 69, which would certainly set the matter at rest. I do not find his argument persuasive. However, he has put fairly the point at issue. We are dealing with the loss made by a person who deals in good faith with an unauthorised person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that that loss is a purely commercial one and should stand. However, I believe, as do my hon. Friends and possibly the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), that the amendment would provide an additional sanction that would strengthen the case for authorisation. It would make people even more careful about securing authorisation if they had to bear the loss in such a case. I suspect that we shall not reach agreement on this and, despite the Minister's apparent obduracy I have no> doubt that he and his officials will read 	<i>Hansard</i> carefully. Perhaps over-optimistically I hope that he will think again. Therefore, I shall not press the matter to a vote, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, it may be as well to draw it to the attention of the Minister, in case it has some merit.

Some might say that this is a nit-picking amendment, but it covers a point that has long puzzled many people involved in this area from the inception of Professor Gower's review. In all the documents, including Professor Gower's report, and I suspect, the White Paper, the term " self-regulatory organisation " has been used. Yet, we find that a slightly-different term has been used in the Bill. This may perhaps be no more than a matter of curiosity, but why has the change been made when people have got used to one phrase? Is there any technical reason for the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, as I think the hon.

The hon Gentleman can rest assured that advce was taken from those with expertise in such matters who took the view that " self-regulating " is the correct term. I agree, and I hope that the hon Gentleman will accept that the chore of changing the words, every time that they occur in the Bill, provides an argument of convenience for maintaining the present wording, even if the hon Gentleman does not share my preference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have quite rested my whole case on the expertise.

Why are the Opposition so attached to a word that ends with the suffix " tory "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My rejoinder is that when the Minister said that he had not knowingly consulted any member of the University of Oxford, he might have said " recklessly ". He may well have acted recklessly here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not disposed to take the matter too seriously, but there is the glimmering of an argument here for, as my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) pointed out, the word "regulatory " is used on all publications on the subject and one might not want too easily to substitute the word " regulating ". One would speak of a " regulating function " or a " regulating body ". It is more natural to say "regulatory", despite the inappropriate suffix. There may be a case for consistency: if we use " regulatory " we should use " self-regulatory ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point no more strongly. The Minister put forward the argument of convenience, and it would be inconvenient to change every instance in which die word appears, but surely, the argument was against the change in the first place. It was perhaps unfortunate that the hon. and learned Gentleman succumbed to the advice that he so recklessly took.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause states one of the cardinal principles of the Bill—namely, that authorisation should be by membership of recognised self-regulating organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will be in order, Sir Michael, if I use the opportunity afforded by the clause stand part debate to ask my hon. and learned Friend to unfold a little his thinking on an appropriate structure and pattern for self-regulating organisations. You properly ruled me out of order when I attempted to raise the issue earlier. I hope that this is a better chosen moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will need to be satisfied that the intended manner of proceeding of the designated agency and the sub-structure of self-regulating organisations will provide effective protection for investors. It follows that die Secretary of State and my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary must have given some consideration to what would constitute a satisfactory pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important dilemma. The obvious case, which I understand commands overwhelming assent in the City, is that the number of SROs should be limited to the fewest possible. The reasons for that argument are clear. Each SRO will be expensive to operate and the cost of multiplying SROs could create serious difficulty. We want to keep the system as simple as possible. Moreover, it is important that people of suitably high quality and calibre should serve on the SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons there should be relatively few SROs, but there must not be gaps between SROs through which different types of unwholesome activity and investment business could slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put forward for consideration some counter-suggestions. If there are to be, say, only five self-regulating organisations, each inevitably regulating businesses of various sorts, there will be extensive overlaps in their spheres of responsibility and action. The SROs are likely to emerge as rival organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that a pattern should not develop whereby investment businesses will find themselves opting to join one club rather than another. Will my hon. and learned Friend assure me that we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
not see emerging a number of rival conglomerate SROs with something of the character of trade associations and with a natural propensity to seek to promote the interests of their member firms as well as having regard to investor protection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. and learned Friend of the observation of the Nobel laureate economist, Professor Stigler, that the typical history of regulatory organisations is that they end up protecting the businesses that they are supposed to regulate. Therefore, I shall be grateful if my hon. Friend will tell us something of his thinking on this important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not lay down a pattern or structure for SROs. or require an authorised business to join a particular, or indeed any, SRO. It is for the practitioners themselves to come forward with their own plans for self-regulation and not for the Government to impose a detailed pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Securities and Investments Board is active in the developing potential SROs, fostering some candidates and discouraging others. Its aim, which the Government support, is to have SROs covering the whole range of investment activity with the minimum of duplication. It seeks to bring about some mergers between the potential candidates to reduce their number. The power under clause 10(4) to refuse an application because the applicant proposes to regulate activities already adequately covered by other organisations is a necessary support for powers of persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wholly unpersuaded by the argument that I seemed to detect at the heart of the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) that there was a danger that conglomerate SROs might degenerate into trade associations having first and foremost in their considerations the protection of their members. A far more serious danger seems to be that the greater the number of SROs, the more closely any one SRO would correspond to the interests of, by definition, a smaller group of people, more narrowly defined, carrying on a particular kind of business activity; whereas the fewer the number of SROs, the greater the extent to which they are conglomerate—to use my hon. Friend's word—and the more activities that are encompassed within their scope, the less is the danger that they will degenerate into trade associations or cosy clubs, and the less the temptation will be for them to put the protection of their members' interests to the fore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have outlined the Government's thinking on this topic sufficiently to show my hon. Friend that I consider the approach taken by the SIB to keep the number of SROs to a minimum to be correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) has done a service to the Committee by showing that we can indeed have a short debate on an important issue on the clause. I listened to the Minister with great interest and considerable sympathy. He put very fairly the balance of considerations to be taken into account
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
in deciding the number of, and precise interface between, possible SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is, however, in some difficulty— as I am sure the Minister accepts—not only in this respect but in others, in mat much of the process of setting up the structures that will underpin the Bill is going on outside the Committee and outside the scope of me Bill. Can the Minister enlighten us a little further on present negotiations on changes in the scope and number of SROs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About the time of Second Reading, when it appeared that we would be confronted with seven SROs, my feeling was that that was about the right number, striking the right balance between too specific an identity, which would lead to the dangers of cosy clubs and trade associations, and the enormous conglomerates that swept up everything. Since then, we have heard that the SIB is concerned to promote mergers—mergers between bodies that in some cases do not yet exist, which is slightly odd— that would reduce that number from seven to five and in some cases put together unlikely bedfellows, such as NASDIM, LAUTRO, LUTIRO and IMRO. Can the Minister give us a progress report on the negotiations and say what the outcome might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us about the nature of the constitutions of the SROs? The points that have just been made have an enormous amount to do with the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). Who is on an SRO means simply who will run them. The question of who runs them is at the heart of the matter. Will the constitutions of individual SROs be dominated by those within them? There are many examples, such as the Professions Supplementary to Medicines Act 1960 and other examples of equivalent types of SROs in legislation. Can the Minister say whether the balance of membership will be in the hands of practitioners or will there be a sufficient independence within the constitution to ensure that die objects of the Bill are fully carried through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the provisions of schedule 2 will not have escaped the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), who says that we shall come to them. I shall look forward to that, but I do not wish to add anything now to the provisions of schedule 2 in response to my hon. Friend's question about the constitution of the self-regulating organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot add much to what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said about the negotiations that are in progress, which may, or may not, lead to an amalgamation between some of the putative SROs leading to an eventual five SRO system as opposed to seven, which seemed likely at the time of Second Reading. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity of lending my support to the efforts that are being made to reduce the number of self-regulating organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
I shall refer to one aspect that I did mention when I responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). A real question arises involving both financial and human resources in putting into place an effective self-regulating organisation. It is extremely important that those entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of self-regulation should be people of high calibre who are capable of discharging their duties effectively. The fewer the number of SROs, the greater the prospect that such people will be entrusted with those duties and the smaller the risk mat scarce human resources, as well as scarce financial resources, will be dissipated. That is why I support the efforts presently being made to minimise the number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply, particularly on the question of the effort being made by the SIB and others to reduce the number of SROs, but could he be a little more forthcoming? I understand that the Minister's officials are involved in the discussions. If they are, I am sure that the Minister has something to add.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, that is not the case. That is a matter for the Securities Investments Board, which is dealing with the matter in the way that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining his position in respect of the desirable number of SROs; that is helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, may I express a note of caution, bearing in mind remarks made on opening this debate. Opposition Members accept that self-regulation fulfils an important role and it is therefore important that SROs are adequately staffed, resourced and financed. But it would be unfortunate if those considerations promoted a structure of SROs which was inappropriate, because it compressed too many people under the same heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, it would be unfortunate if the structure of the Bill were to be driven by the engine of the paucity of resources of putative SROs. In those circumstances, the Minister would perhaps have to look again at whether SROs, which were such puny creatures, should be entrusted with an important role in regulating the affairs of the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to have seen my broad argument, that, again, there is a balance to be struck between the proper role of SROs and the need to ensure that they can carry out their functions properly. But, on the other hand, we do not want to see inappropriate functions put together, simply for the sake of putting together the required resources. I hope that the Minister will bear that point in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider whether model rules could be devised to cover those parts where SROs have matters in common, so that there will be a degree of consistency between SROs? That would help the courts, if and when questions of judicial review crop up as matters settle down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply to me when he said that his officials were not involved. As I understand it, under clause 10(4), the Minister has the power to refuse recognition, but, in spite of that, does he not also have an ultimate sanction over an SIB decision in this matter? Might he wish to exercise a final restraint in respect of a decision taken by the SIB; without having to use clause 10(4)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those matters will be left to the designated agency if the Secretary of State's powers are transferred to that agency. Of course, the Secretary of State and the Governor of the Bank of England will have powers to appoint and dis miss members of that agency, and control will be exercised in that way. The business of recognition will be entrusted to the SIB</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—completely, because, in deciding whether to recognise an SRO, it will have to comply with the provisions of the Bill. Clause 10 deals with the principles that must be satisfied when the designated agency is considering recognition. The agency will have to comply, therefore, with the provisions of the Bill in carrying out that function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). The provision of model rules will also be a matter for the SIB and it will set out conduct of business and other rules, which could be adopted as a model by SROS. But it is important to recognise that the test provided in the legislation is that of equivalence, not identity, so there will be no duty on SROS to adopt the same rules, although those rules may be a useful guide and, indeed, a model to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press this point, but is there no informal consultative machan-ism whereby the Minister might have some say about the SIB recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As no powers have yet been transferred to the designated agency, it is premature to contemplate whether any informal machinery, of the kind suggested by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), may exist at the relevant time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has touched on the importance of the equivalence of the rules, will he expand further and give his views on the equivalence of their enforcement? That is an equally important aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It follows the point raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) but is more appropriately raised under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an issue of some significance relating to the overall structure of regulation. The clause lays down the basis on which SROs can apply to the Secretary of State. I, too, am anxious about what will happen under clause 96(3), which enables the Secretary of State to transfer to a designated agency any or all of the powers under Chapters II to X of part I of Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear on Second Reading and previously, my preferred structure is for a clear line of command, independence and authority to be provided to the designated agency, from the designated agency exclusively to the SROs, and from the SROs exclusively to their members. I am concerned and suspicious about the extent to which Secretaries of State may hold on to powers which should be transferred to a designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington and other hon. Gentlemen should think carefully about pressing the case that the Secretary of State should retain some right to be approached by SROs, even with the delegated powers being given to the SIB. The hon. Gentleman may unintentionally do> that which he, his colleagues and many other people, seek to prevent, and undermine the independence and authority of the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether this is the appropriate time to seek the assurance that I believe my hon. and learned Friend mentioned earlier. Will he assure us that if the powers here and elsewhere in the Bill are delegated to the designated agency, the Secretary of State will not retain a right for SROs to approach him independently? I ask that question because later we shall debate whether individual businesses should have the right to apply separately to the Secretary of State, instead of to the SRO or the SIB, for authorisation to carry on their businesses. A duality of routes of application for authorisation is unjustified, and nor is it justified for an application for the existence of an SRO. Will my

	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
hon. and learned Friend provide some clarification of his intentions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not envisaged that if powers are transferred to a designated agency the Secretary of State will retain powers to recognise self-regulating organisations, or to authorise investment businesses and so on. The transfer of powers will be complete, and there will be no residual power of the type which worried my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) will not be surprised to hear that I sympathise with his general argument and he will perhaps know that we intend to try to convert the SIB into a more substantial body, with a clearer identity and better definitions of its powers and its relations with SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's more specific question on direct authorisation. An amendment already tabled by my hon. Friends and myself may commend itself to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) in the earlier debate were directed towards the problems of the transitional period. He is right; we are in the awkward position of contemplating a set of statutory powers that are to be delegated to a designated agency, yet the designated agency and many of the SROs have as yet no real being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about the role of the Secretary of State or the Minister in the interim period. The Minister did not appear to dispute that he would be playing an important part in setting up the structure which will eventually emerge. The Minister said that his preference is for five SROs, and therefore I assume that he is in touch with the SIB, and encouraging the board and the representatives of the SROs to reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington was right to raise the point, and I do not think that it cuts across what was said by the hon. Member for Chichester, with whom we largely agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not discuss the reference to myself made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), as I agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister, in seeking to reassure his hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), is determined that the powers will be transferred, am I to assume that the Government will amend clause 96(1 Xb) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he may, subject to the provisions of this section"</p></blockquote>
to read
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall"?</p></blockquote>
The Minister seemed to be putting a firm case to his hon. Friend. We go back to the old subjunctive mood of doubt. I am sure that the Minister can be stronger, as he was strong in his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that we want to go too far down that road. We are anti

	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GRANT AND REFUSAL OF RECOGNITION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 95 in page 7, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) In making a recognition order under this section the Secretary of State may prohibit any or all of th members of the organisation, identified either individually or by category, from joining any other self-regulatorj organisation.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment takes us back to our earlier debate on the desirability of the Minister's having reserve powers to inhibit, or prevent, certain person; or institutions from conducting one or more kind; of investment business, notwithstanding the fact that they were authorised to conduct other forms of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to clause 45, and the conduct of business rules to show that in the case ol those directly authorised, the power would exist and could be exercised. The Minister, and the SIB in the fullness of time, could, by making the rules, specify the kinds of business that a person is authorised to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 in some ways addresses similar considerations in respect of SROs. It is true that provisions such as clause 10(3) and (4) in a sense provide for lines to be drawn between different sorts of investment business. Subsection (4), for example, provides for a degree of exclusivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(3) lays down that an SRO must indeed specify that its members are not, simply by virtue of their membership of that body, authorised to conduct forms of investment business with which it is not concerned. That is all clear and straightforward and acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear, however, whether there is to be a provision in respect of members of SROs to be administered by the SIB, equivalent to the powers of the SIB under clause 45 in respect of those directly authorised by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see the structure that is proposed, a given SRO will be able to delimit its own operations and enforce them in respect of its members, but there is nothing to prevent a person authorised by virtue of membership of that SRO from seeking membership of another SRO to entitle him to carry out other forms of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may correct me, but I see no reserve power anywhere to enable the Secretary of State or the SIB to say, " No, that shall not happen." The danger that I see is that each SRO, in examining each application for membership of a body, institution or person, will have its own frame of reference and sphere of activity, but will not necessarily take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
an overall view of the range of activities of the given person or institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast with the position of a directly authorised person who can be told, " You are authorised to do that rather than that," there is no power as I see it to say to a financial conglomerate, " You are authorised to join an SRO which entitles you to arrange deals, or deal, or manage collective investment schemes, or advise, but you must not join an SRO for the purpose of conducting another form: of investment business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may think that this is not an important point, but I feel it important to have such a power in the Bill, so that it is not left merely to the rather fragmentary authority of a range of SROs none of which need necessarily consult each other, and to provide the power to take an overall view as to who does what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell me whether I am wrong in saying that that power does not exist, or whether I am right and that he might support an amendment on those lines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised that more amendments were not tabled to clause 10. I suspect that most of the thinking went into schedule 2, hence the proliferation of amendments to it. I say that because, as I have said on other occasions, the key question, after the administrative framework has been set up, is who will actually be running the show? For that, we have the fit and proper person test. There is some indication, which I should prefer to leave until we reach schedule 2, as to who a fit and proper person would be, but I believe that the Bill is about responsible enterprise, and therefore I think it important to ensure that, when the powers under clause 10 are exercised, that is fully taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point relates to model rules. To obtain real equivalence—I mean equivalence, because I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister is right on this matter—between the different organisations, it is important that the rules are alike so that they can be fairly and properly applied. Chapter XII of the Bill deals with the application of the rules on competition. We shall come to that later. It is at the heart of the way in which the Bill will benefit the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister briefly take up those points before we move on to schedule 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the terms of the amendment, and by the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). My understanding is that an individual business has a choice when seeking authorisation. It can apply either to an SRO or to the Secretary of State for permission. Clause 24 sets out the grounds on which an application can be made to the Secretary of State and granted by him. When a business makes an application to the Secretary of State, there is no question that it is authorised to join an SRO; it is simply authorised to carry on business. Clause 10(4) provides that the Secretary of State can take into account various aspects of the business concerned.
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
When he makes his decision, the Secretary of State is quite able to take into account the desirability of a particular conglomerate being involved in one business or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confusion has arisen because the hon. Member for Dagenham is under the impression that the Secretary of State grants authorisation to join an SRO. That is not so. The question whether that is right or wrong is up for grabs, and we can discuss later whether the Secretary of State should be able to duplicate the power of the SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) has not fully understood my point. Perhaps it is not well-taken, in which case the Minister will put me right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about a situation—as the hon. Gentleman has explained—where a person or body has been authorised by virtue of membership of one SRO, and then seeks direct authorisation to carry out some other kind of investment business. I am talking, instead, about a person or body going to successive SROs and being authorised to carry out a range of investment businesses. Nothing in the Bill gives the Secretary of State or the SIB the power to prevent that from happening where appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should say that anything directly related to schedule 2 can be left until we reach schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have correctly understood the amendment, I can understand the motive behind it. The hon Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has expressed concern about the need to ensure that investors do not suffer as a result of conflict of interest on the part of an authorised person. I share that objective and I hope that I can show the Committee that the amendment is not necessary to its achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by echoing the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) at a previous sitting. Conflicts of interest cannot always be avoided. Indeed, in one sense every business transaction is a resolution of a conflict of interest. Some countries have sought to ban conflicts of interest entirely. The result has been stultifying. The development of efficient business has been discouraged and business has moved away from those countries. I do not want the Bill to have that effect. Therefore we must seek to ensure that where a conflict of interest exists, there are arrangements to deal with it in such a way that the investor will not suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the Bill that prevents a person from belonging to more than one recognised self-regulating organisation. Indeed, we fully expect that some businesses will do so, but they will be able to join an organisation only if they can convince it that they are fit and proper to carry on the business regulated by that organisation. In arriving at its decision, each organisation will be able to have regard not only to the business that the organisation regulates, but to any connected business that the applicant carries on. One of the criteria that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
oragnisation will use will be whether the applicant can comply with the organisation's rules on conflicts of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I were to give an example. Let us suppose that organisation A regulates market-making in a particular type of investment. However, organisation A does not regulate management of the same type of investment, and accordingly it has a rule, as required by clause 10(3), prohibiting its members from managing unless they are otherwise authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that one of its members wishes to manage these investments as well as make a market in them, so he applies to organisation B, which regulates investment management. Before organisation B can come to the conclusion that he is fit and proper to manage investments, it must satisfy itself that he has adequate arrangements for complying with the organisation's rules, including those on conflicts of interest. It is not limited to examining only the proposed investment management operation; it can also take into account the person's market-making activities and the arrangements for preventing conflicts of interest from arising. It can do that because paragraph 1(3) of schedule 2 requires the organisation to take into account other business carried on in connection with the investment business in question. If it were not satisfied that the arrangements adequately dealt with possible conflicts of interest, it would be entitled to refuse membership even if, considered as a separate business, the applicant would have been considered fit and proper to manage investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a person were refused membership of organisation B, he could apply to the Secretary of State or the designated agency for authorisation, but the Secretary of State or the designated agency would not be limited to examining the business described in the application. In the same way that a recognised self-regulating organisation could do so, he would be able to examine other connected areas of the applicant's business, and to refuse authorisation if there were not adequate arrangements to deal with conflicts of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, a person who is authorised by virtue of his membership of a recognised SRO will be prevented from carrying on kinds of business not regulated by that SRO unless he can convince a relevant recognised SRO or the Secretary of State or designated agency that he is fit and proper to do so. If he does not have adequate arrangements for dealing with conflicts of interest he will not pass this test and so will not be able to carry on the business in question without breaking bis SRO's rules, with all the consequences that that would entail. I believe that the Bill achieves the objectives of the hon. Member for Dagenham and that the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without straying too far from clause 10, may I add that the Securities and Investments Board has set out the broad lines of the rules it would propose to make if it becomes a designated agency. On conflicts of interest, it proposes that the rules should
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
require that a firm would be allowed to deal with a client for its own account only on strictly limited conditions. The conditions would include obtaining the client's permission and observing the "best execution" principle, so that the deal could be executed only if it were the best available in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board also proposes that the rules should require a firm to disclose all material interests to its customers. Recognised self-regulating organisations will have to have similar rules. Those considerations are identified in paragraph 3.33 of subsection (8) in the board's publication "Regulation of Investment Business: The New Framework ", which was published shortly before Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) will forgive me if I do not deal with his questions now as, in accordance with your ruling, Sir Michael, I think that they would be dealt with more appropriately elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that view. On this occasion I agree with the Minister rather than with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). Apart from the reasons that he gave, which are important, the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) also mentioned an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that we must establish a clear line of accountability and know precisely where the buck stops. In many cases the Secretary of State will require reserve powers, as we have already said in relation to a previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State has a reserve power to operate, it will diminish the accountability of self-regulating organisations to take the necessary decisions. In other words, they can say—and this is die key argument—diat it is not their ultimate responsibility, but 'that of the Secretary of State. It is one of the significant failures of the appropriate regulation of the City and, especially of Lloyd's, that no one knows where the buck stops. Some say that it stops with the Secretary of State, but, of course, it never works out that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SROs are to be accountable, they must have the right to involve themselves in the matter. If that is passed to the Secretary of State, it will weaken accountability and lines of responsibility. I do not, therefore, support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was much encouraged by the Minister's comments. I am satisfied that we agree about what the Bill does at present, and that the Minister understands the purport of the amendment
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start at the same point, identified by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), mat conflicts of interest will not only be inevitable, but will grow in the evolving City of me future. Indeed, in many ways, they are desirable. Much of the reason behind the City revolution is to construct great financial conglomerates, which can compete on international terms. Nevertheless, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
development is not without dangers, one of which is that conflicts of interest will be endemic and extraordinarily difficult to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, conflicts of interest can be dealt with by a range of measures, such as Chinese walls, but the Bill should address the problem of minimising, where appropriate, conflicts of interest before they arise. As I understand it, the Minister accepts that point in respect of those directly authorised, because—as he pointed out in an earlier debate—the provisions of clause 45 give him, or the SIB, the power to say in respect of an applicant for direct authorisation, " You will be authorised to manage investment funds, but you will not be authorised to deal in those funds." It was interesting that the Minister chose that sort of conflict of interest for his example, because it causes concern, especially in some parts of the City where difficulties arise between the roles of managing and dealing in investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest in the amendment that the SIB should, in appropriate cases, exercise a power equivalent to that which exists in the case of those people directly authorised by virtue of membership of SROs. However, the Minister says that, under the Bill, people will be entitled to join more than one SRO, and that each SRO will apply its own test, including the question of whether conflicts of interest might arise, by virtue of other types of investment business. However, there is one difficulty—the designated agency, or the supreme body will not have the power to say, ab initio, " You will be authorised to conduct that sort of business by joining that sort of SRO, but you will not be authorised to conduct another sort of investment business. For that reason, we prohibit you from joining another sort of SRO." Instead, it will be left to SROs, which are essentially informal bodies, and it will be difficult for them to lay down that sort of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore looking for an equivalence of powers, so that the safeguards provided by clause 45, in respect of those seeking direct authorisation, also exist in respect of those who might try to obtain authorisation by joining SROs. We want some overall ability to lay down the rules in advance. We do not think that it is good enough to leave it to the interfaces, which may be difficult to draw, between voluntary bodies and SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) supported my point, rather than the point that he thought he was making. We want a balance between direct supervision and self-regulation. We want that moved towards the powers and role of the central body, so that it can distinguish between one power and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not take that point fully. He was content to rely on the interlocking jurisdictions of SROs, but I want the SIB to have the same power over directly authorised people. Does the Minister have anything further to add on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have anything of substance to add. I rely on the point made by the hon Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister restate the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Gentleman's point to be, that if there were a designated agency such as the hon Member for Dagenham described—although it is difficult to know how he would like to give it the specific and additional power of intervention that he seems to have in mind, or how it would work—the self-regulating organisations would say, " We do not have to bother about that. We can leave it to the designated agency."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure of the legislation depends on placing responsibility with the self-regulating agencies. We intend them to be effective, adequate, and responsible. We are wary of introducing a provision that would enable them to shrug, or shuffle, off that responsibility and leave another body to step in and secure any shortcomings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNITION OF SELF-REGULATING ORGANISATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 135, line 19, at beginning insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The organisation must have financial resources sufficient for the proper performance of its functions.".</p></blockquote>
In considering the amendment, we must start with schedule 3, in which there is an equivalent provision for recognised investment exchanges. Many people have been struck by the lack of such a provision for self-regulating organisations in schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remarks of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) in the clause 7 stand part debate were much to the point. We all feel considerable anxiety about the capacity of self-regulating organisations to carry the burden to be placed on them. I intervened earlier to say that we are content to see SROs carry out these functions, as they are the most appropriate bodies for them, but we are worried—as I think the Minister is—that some putative SROs may not have the resources, let alone the experience and expertise, to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the SROs that will eventually be required do not exist and some of the existing ones are in no more than embryonic form. The National
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
Association of Security Dealers and Investment Managers, NASDIM, has the best record here,— other than the stock exchange itself—but even it is short of staff, resources and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that the stock exchange on this issue, as on many others, is in a different position. It is an SRO with adequate resources and long experience, but it is alone among the possible SROs to be in that happy position. It is all the more surprising that schedule 2 overlooks the requirement of adequate resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a point of substance. I am sure that the Minister is as worried about such matters as we are. If the hon. and learned Gentleman tells us that the requirement is not necessary in schedule 2, will he then say why it was felt necessary to include it in schedule 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If SROs are to be effective regulators they must clearly have adequate financial resources, but I do not believe that amendment No. 125 is necessary to secure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the wording of schedule 2 that in considering whether to recognise an SRO the Secretary of State or designated agency can have regard not only to the rules and arrangements of the organisation, but to the way in which it operates or can be expected to operate. For example, the question he has to ask is not whether the organisation has arrangements for the investigation of complaints but whether it has effective arrangements. In deciding whether the arrangements are effective, the Secretary of State will be able to take into account the financial and human resources that will be devoted to the task. If he believes that they are insufficient, he will be able to conclude that although there might be arrangements, there are not effective arrangements, and he could refuse to recognise on that ground. A similar argument applies in the case of the other requirements of schedule 2. The need for adequate financial resources is therefore implicit in the schedule as it stands, and I believe that an explicit reference is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about schedule 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) asks about schedule 3. Schedule 3 contains a specific requirement, but it serves a different purpose. Schedule 3 deals with investment exchanges. A recognised exchange will either have to provide clearing services itself or have clearing arrangements with a recognised clearing house. One way of providing clearing services would be to guarantee all deals done on the exchange. The exchange might then be called upon to complete a deal if one party to it defaulted, and it is important to the integrity of the system that it has the resources to do so. But recognised SROs will not be exposed to such risks, so I do not believe that a similar express provision is needed in schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that recognised investment exchanges and self-regulating organisations will have different functions. That is self-evident. However, he has not explained clearly
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
why the adequacy of resources, which he concedes will be required by SROs, is not specified in schedule 2 as it is in schedule 3, which deals with recognised investment exchanges.

The fact that the resources are required for different purposes merely reflects the fact that the two types of bodies have different roles. It does not alter the fact that for both types of body the adequacy of their resources will be an important determinant of whether they can carry out their functions under the Bill.

A number of SROs will have no evidence of adequate resources. I have an uneasy feeling that the Minister is worried that if he includes the provision in the schedule, the SIB may wish to recognise as SROs bodies that do not have the required resources. I am afraid that die Minister's comments suggest that that fear is at the back of his mind and that that is why such a standard provision has been omitted from schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for adequate funds can be met more easily with most investment exchanges, but there are doubts with SROs. That is why we and others are anxious to include the provision in the schedule. Unless the Minister can suggest a better reason for its omission, I fear that we may have to press our point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's explanation was not clear and I am sure that he will correct me if I misrepresent what he said. Was the Minister saying that the SROs had a monitoring function and that he could deal with the question whether they had sufficient funding under clause 10(5)? Further, did the Minister mean that the arrangement under paragraph 1 of schedule 3, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>" The exchange must have financial resources "</p></blockquote>
related only to the activities carried out on the exchange, and had nothing to do with monitoring?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction is between the activities on the exchange and monitoring, but both should be dealt with under clause 10(5), which deals with the Secretary of State's right to refuse an application for recognition. Is that what the Minister means? If so, we may wish to table a further amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is much more than monitoring. I do not wish to convey the impression that the functions of an SRO are limited to monitoring. That is far from being the case. But there is a specific and different function that is unique to investment exchanges and which does not apply to SROs. It calls in a particular and specific way for the resources to carry out that function adequately. The need for resources does not apply in the same way to SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for my failure to explain effectively that the powers exist to assess whether a self-regulating organisation will be able to carry out its duties and whether its arrangements will be effective, taking into account the adequacy of its resources. The requirement is implicit in schedule 2, It needs to be explicit in schedule 3 because of the specific and unique function of investment exchanges,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
which have no parallel in the SROs covered in schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that distinction puzzling. I listened to the Minister carefully. It could be argued that there was a greater need under schedule 3 to make the matter explicit, but that is not to deny the need to include it in schedule 2. Indeed, I would argue that if, as the Minister argues, duties are inherent in schedule 2 to take account of financial resources, similar duties are inherent in schedule 3. Paragraph 2 of schedule 3 says that the exchange must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"conducted in an orderly manner and so as to afford proper protection to investors."</p></blockquote>
The Minister would, I am sure, concede that it was inherent in the proper protection of investors that there should be adequate financial resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the importance of making that explicit in schedule 3, but I cannot accept that it is therefore not important to make it explicit in schedule 2. I believe that this is a vital and substantial point and I shall try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept the need for self-regulation as a major element in the Bill. There is a dual instrument here—the criminal law and the civil law. But the existence of the civil law as a safeguard for those who have been damaged because the Bill has been contravened in some way leads to a second problem which has been expressed to me by a senior member of the stock exchange. He said: " If there is a body of civil law which is to be relied on, there will be a tendency to set up minimal rules for SROs, so that the power to challenge them by those who seek redress will be limited to the smallest scope possible."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may shake his head, but I believe that that is a not unfair point. I am arguing that there will be a tendency to go for the fewest rules to enforce. There should be a specific and explicit requirement to which the Secretary of State can return, saying, " You have insufficient financial resources to do the job properly." I know that the Secretary of State, too, can say that the rules are insufficient, and that is important; but if he refuses to recognise this or that SRO, he is much better able to make the point about financial resources being available if there is an explicit provision to that effect. It will be both easier for him to put into effect and easier for others who are trying to judge whether they can meet the criteria for recognition. It would be more honest, more straightforward and more enforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Minister believes that such a provision might be in some way damaging. The extra force that it gives to his actions may seem to him marginal. That is fair enough. But what damage can such a provision do? The Minister has not answered that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about what is or is not a fit and proper person for the purposes of the schedule. I referred to that matter on clause 10, and I should be grateful if the Minister would
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
examine it. Paragraph 5 on page 2 of the red SIB document states as an objective that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no-one be permitted to do investment business unless he is ' fit and proper'—that is, honest, competent and solvent."</p></blockquote>
In relation to those members of the organisation, as compared to the organisation itself, should the criteria of " fit and proper persons" be identified—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I know that you are in the Chair, but the Opposition are finding it extremely difficult to follow some of the interventions of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). They do not appear to be on the point but to be some kind of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a matter for me to judge. If one judged matters entirely on whether one completely followed hon. Members in Committee, the Chairman's task would be more difficult than it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from a private word with the Minister just now that he will be happy to deal later with the matter, in which case I shall be glad to defer it until we reach the appropriate part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond briefly to the points made by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ash-down)? It is not a question of assessing what damage the inclusions of such a provision will inflict on schedule 2. We adopt the standpoint that if a provision is not necessary it should not be in the Bill. It is not necessary because, in considering whether adequate arrangements for the effective carrying out of the functions of the self-regulating organisation are provided, it would be possible for the Secretary of State or the designated agency to determine whether the resources are there to back up those arrangements. So it is inherent in the question whether adequate arrangements are made and it is not necessary to have a specific requirement for financial resources in schedule 2. If it is not necessary to have it in schedule 2, it should not be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil began by discussing whether the rules would be minimalist and adequate. That is an entirely different matter. The designated agency—or the Secretary of State if the powers are not transferred to the designated agency—in deciding whether a self-regulating organisation should be recognised, must determine whether its rules provide a standard equivalent to the designated agency's own rules. That is a separate matter and will have to be assessed. If the equivalence test is not satisfied, the self-regulating organisation will not be recognised. But on the question whether arrangements are adequate for effective compliance, resources can, and should, be taken into account in assessing that and there is no need for a specific provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess to being unconvinced by the Minister's remarks. I understand his argument on the precise need for the paragraph in schedule 3; it is because the specific nature of the functions of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
investment exchange require it. That is acceptable. But we cannot understand why there is an objection to a similar provision in schedule 2. I assume that it cannot be that it would make things more awkward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is not necessary, yet the provisions in the clause are not so specific, nor do they lay down as an absolute requirement that there should be adequate financial resources. I agree that under the clause the Secretary of State or the SIB will be entitled to take that into account, but there is no statement in the schedule in the case of an SRO that there should be such adequate financial resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for Opposition Members to understand why that statement of the obvious is not acceptable to the Government as part of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, was interested in the Minister's purist attitude in saying that if it was not necessary we shall not have it. Does he agree that a reading of schedule 3 might well lead to the same conclusion? If the Minister intends to be consistent in his purist attitude of not having one word, one phrase, or one clause in the Bill that is unnecessary, he should apply that attitude to schedule 3, too. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
should like that to happen, but it must be applied to schedule 3(2), as well. Why is not the Minister consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suggested earlier, the unfortunate suspicion lingers in the minds of Opposition Members that the Minister is worried that such a precise provision would be an awkward obstacle to the recognition of self-regulating organisations when that stage is reached. As a matter of practical politics, the Minister may be worried about that; it is also important to us.

The best way to bring the debate to an end is not to press the amendment to a Division. It will be to everyone's advantage to return to the role of the SROs and their adequacy in resources when the Bill reaches the Floor of the House. I give notice now that we shall table an amendment along those lines on Report and I hope that we can have a debate then.
