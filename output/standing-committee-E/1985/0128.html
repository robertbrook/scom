	<p>[Sir MICHAEL SHAW 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Financial Services Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That during the proceedings on the Financial Services Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q>
May I say on behalf of all members of the Committee how pleased we are that you, Sir Michael are to preside over our proceedings. I hope that the proceedings will enable the provisions of the Bill to be examined throughly and, indeed, improved. I reiterate the undertaking that I gave the House on Second Reading that suggestions and amendments will be considered carefully in a constructive attitude. In that spirit, I intend to make available to all members of the Committee copies of the notes on clauses and, I have already done so for the first 20 clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, I begin by endorsing the Minister's welcome to you, Sir Michael. I have a particular reason for doing so; I have a warm recollection of your chairmanship of the Insolvency Bill Committee on which I served. I believe that the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) is the only other survivor from that saga. In a sea of instability and uncertainty at the Department of Trade and Industry it is pleasant to see at least one rock of stability and permanence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the sittings motion, which I have little difficulty in accepting on behalf of the Opposition. I endorse what the Minister said about the need to approach the Bill in a constructive spirit and I am grateful to him for the notes on clauses and for the promise of more to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not intend to be obstructive. Our objective will be to improve the Bill and so I hope that the Minister will not rush to amend the sittings motion. There is every prospect of making reasonable progress, but we should bear in mind that we must also take account of a timetable outside the Committee. Much of what we need to know about the impact of the Bill has yet to be revealed to us. The Government are to table more amendments to the Bill and the Securities and Investments Board has yet to publish its conduct of business rules. Consultative papers by the Marketing of Investments Board Organising Committee are outstanding and the Lloyd's inquiry has not yet really got under way. Perhaps the Minister can say when he thinks that that inquiry will report, as it would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
be useful for us to be able to take into account its findings when we decide in the context of the Bill what should be done about Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that and having urged the Minister not to be tempted to go too fast, I assure him and the Committee that the Opposition will do what they can to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the helpful and constructive attitude that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary is adopting to the way in which we shall consider the Bill. It will be most helpful to have notes on clauses. I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that we need to consider the timetable, as the Committee is running in tandem with developments outside the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put a specific point to my hon. and learned Friend. If circumstances arise where he feels that it would be helpful to send a note of explanation to a member of the Committee on a certain point, will he ensure that other members of the Committee also receive the explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I cast my eye around the Committee, I see some old faithfuls from the annual Finance Bill Committees. They should understand Labour Members' attitude to the Bill. It is characteristic that Conservative Members rarely take part in those debates. Perhaps the Patronage Secretary instructs them to keep their seats and allow Opposition Members to dominate the Bill. Invariably, little flexibility is shown while the Bill is in Committee and any amendments made are based on undertakings given in Committee, which are realised on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We go into this Bill in the hope that we can forge cross-party alliances, because fraud in the City is causing great anxiety in the country. The Bill will enable us to resolve many of the matters and, if cross-party alliances can be forged in the public interest, Conservative Members will feel free to debate them, unrestricted by the Whips. If that is the case, I hope that a Bill will come out of Committee which will appease public anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have much time to deal with those matters over the next few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me thank those outside organisations which have circulated much information to us, and especially for the visit arranged for Labour Members to the stock exchange yesterday. Many of us found that fascinating; historically Labour Members have little experience of such matters as we do not spend our time speculating there. Let me put on record my thanks, and that of my colleagues, to Mr Lynton Jones for his arrangements for an excellent meeting yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), I do not know how far it will be possible to forge cross-party alliances. However, in respect of dealing with fraudsters in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
City, this Conservative Government—as the Bill demonstrates—are more anxious than previous Governments to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That, during the proceedings on the Financial Services Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, that is to say, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 10, Schedule 2, Clauses 11 to 36, Schedule 3, Clauses 37 to 83, Schedule 4, Clauses 84 to 96, Schedules 5 and 6, Clauses 97 and 98, Schedule 7, Clauses 99 to 110, Schedule 8, Clauses 111 to 116, Schedule 9. Clauses 117 to 142, Schedule 10, Clauses 143 to 165, Schedule 11, Clause 166, Schedule 12, New Clauses, New Schedules and Schedule 13.</p></q>
I hope that that will be convenient for hon. Members. The schedules are related to the relevant clauses and that is why they are set out in the order that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already established a remarkable degree of harmony in Committe, although I do not know how long it will last. The motion suggests an order for dealing with the business which is eminently sensible and reasonable and we are content to accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on, let me say a few words. I deliberately delayed my thanks to hon. Gentlemen for their courtesy in their opening remarks. I hope that it will be a useful and constructive Committee stage; indeed, that is why I sought to chair the Committee, although perhaps I should not say so. I am glad to see that the Committee consists of hon. Members who clearly have an interest in the subject. Therefore, I can but echo, impartially, of course, the intentions of all Committee Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now make a few normal comments. First, there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I remind hon. Members that they should always give adequate notice of amendments which they propose to table. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) mentioned the Insolvency Bill. As this Bill, like that measure, is complicated, I urge that more than usual notice is given of major amendments to allow the rest of the Committee to take note of them and to consult outside authorities. The purpose of the Committee stage is to discuss legislation in detail and to check it with outside bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it right to mention those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I fear that I must at this stage disrupt the atmosphere of harmony that has been established in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise a point of order, not out of any animus against the Minister, the hon. and learned Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) personally, or out of any desire to embarrass him, but because we must raise the question of the Minister's interest —which he very properly declared to the House— in a matter of great contention in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is ironic and acute because we are dealing with a Bill whose raison d'être is to minimise and deal with conflicts of interest. I do not hold the Minister personally responsible for the problem that we face, but nevertheless the hon. and learned Gentleman appears, from his declaration of interest, to be involved in a conflict of interest of precisely the sort that the Bill seeks to outlaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground that the primary concern of the Bill is conflict of interest. Many of the scandals and frauds in the City which are, in many ways, the genesis of the Bill, involve conflicts of interest, although they are dressed up in other terminology. The problems at Lloyd's for example, have involved conflicts between the interests of the underwriters and those of the investors on whose account they manage funds. The problems of Halliday-Simpson on the stock exchange, of commodity dealers, and the problems caused by the flotation of British Telecom shares, to which I have tried to draw attention, have all involved conflicts between the personal and direct interest of professional people operating in the City and the interests of those on whose account they are supposed to be acting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is not our purpose to suggest that the Minister as a member of Lloyd's, as I understand him to be—he may wish to elucidate his position— is acting in an either potentially or actually fraudulent way, or that there is perhaps even a real conflict of interests. Nevertheless, it is scandalous that the Government should put forward to pilot the Bill a Minister who has a clear personal interest in its subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help but feel that if these matters were being arranged now, and not, as they were, two or three months ago, a somewhat chastened Government might have tried rather harder to avoid the problem. We are still living in the aftermath of a typical piece of Government arrogance: two or three months, or even longer, ago, when the Minister was asked to take on the Bill, the Government thought that they could sweep aside the rules that would ordinarily apply. However, I suspect that in today's climate they would have taken more care over what is clearly an extremely sensitive issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is indisputable that one of the major issues in this Committee stage will be whether Lloyd's should be brought within the ambit of the Bill. I say that, although it is my contention that Lloyd's is already within the ambit of the Bill. The question is whether Lloyd's should be subjected to the regulatory framework created by the Bill. The terms of clause 40 clearly show that Lloyd's is already within the Bill. Clause 40 makes it clear that, but for its specific exclusion, the investment business carried out by the council of Lloyd's or by underwriting members of Lloyd's would fall within the Bill. We must therefore confront the question whether Lloyd's should be within the Bill. On clause stand part, quite
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
apart from any amendment which might be tabled, we have to say yes or no to the proposition in clause 40, that Lloyd's should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the Opposition, in a spirit of mischief, who raise the issue; it is raised for us by the structure of the Bill and by the Minister's interests as a member of Lloyd's. The question whether Lloyd's is to be regulated as at present, under the Lloyd's Act 1982—a private Act and therefore an example of self-regulation—or brought within the regulatory framework of the Bill matters enormously to Lloyd's as an institution as it has made very clear. It therefore also matters to every individual member of Lloyd's. The Minister has very properly declared his interest. He is such a member of Lloyd's and is therefore inescapably affected by the decision that the Committee and, eventually, the House will have to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general principles that are thought to govern such cases—the Minister's predicament is not unique, although it has some unusual features—are well established. They go back to a body of rules which, in their modern form at any rate, were first enunciated by Asquith and were reformulated in 1952 by Sir Winston Churchill. They have since been endorsed by successive Prime Ministers of many Governments and, for the sake of convenience, can be called the Churchill-Butler rules. They were certainly endorsed by Harold Wilson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I am in order to quote from those rules, but I shall nevertheless paraphrase them. I make that point simply because they are not the subject of some controversy about their confidential nature. They are on the record and have been published in 	<i>Hansard.</i> In broad terms, the opening principle of the rules says that a Minister must arrange his affairs so that no conflict between his personal interests and his public duties arises or is seen to arise. That latter phrase is important. We are suggesting not that there is a practical conflict, but that it looks extraordinarily peculiar that, given his interest, the Minister should be dealing with the Bill. As one of the major purposes of the Bill is to ensure that everything both is and appears to be as seemly as it ought, the Minister is bound to take account of the fact that this conflict of interests looks remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those principles have been endorsed by a number of Prime Ministers. But we are fortunate—I am not sure that that is the right word—to have further illumination of the rules that might be said to govern the Minister's predicament. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) recently put in as evidence to the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service a document issued by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Callaghan) when he was Prime Minister. Although that document was marked " confidential" it has been published by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield because it has been made availabel to those who re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
requested sight of it. In legal terms that would be sufficient publication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the right hon. Gentleman have the author's permission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not checked with my right hon. Friend the former Prime Minister, but I believe that he said that he could see no objection to its being made publicly available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case. The former Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Callaghan) did, indeed, give permission for the document to be published. Unfortunately, the normal Government procedures for publishing confidential documents were not followed in this case because they could not get Chris Moncrieff on the telephone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is, of course, a member of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service. Indeed, he is chairman of the sub-committee to which the evidence has been submitted. As I understand it, the subcommittee has yet to decide exactly how to deal with the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to quote from the document directly, and to the extent that I refer to its contents, I do so on my own responsibility, claiming any necessary privilege. The preamble makes it clear that the body of rules contained in the document has evolved over a long period and has been endorsed by successive Governments, so we are not talking about an innovation made by a relatively recent Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting part of the document is paragraph 76, which specifically refers to the position of Ministers who are names at Lloyd's. It states flatly that no one holding the office of Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer or Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should be a name at Lloyd's. It then says that there may be other Ministers who should not undertake underwriting business in any Lloyd's syndicate and that there may be particular Ministerial duties with which membership of a Lloyd's syndicate would be inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a distinction is drawn between active underwriting membership of a syndicate and membership of Lloyd's as an institution. However, I suggest that those who framed the rule in paragraph 76 did not necessarily have the niceties of such a distinction in mind, but were simply drawing attention to the inconsistency between a connection with Lloyd's in the form of membership and certain ministerial duties. The paragraph concludes by saying that in all such cases or in any case of doubt the Prime Minister's approval must be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael. It is not my unwillingness but your ruling, that prevents me from giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Second Reading debate, I wrote to the Prime Minister asking whether she would conform to the practice established by earlier Prime Ministers. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that he raised the matter with the Prime Minister and that she gave her permission for him to continue with his present responsibilities notwithstanding his membership of Lloyd's. I am disappointed that I have not yet had a reply from the right hon. Lady and I am not sure that the Prime Minister's appraisal of the matter some months ago was as acute as it ought to be now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 76 refers to particular duties that might be inconsistent with a connection with Lloyd's. I put it to the Minister that there could hardly be a set of duties that would bring that principle into play more clearly and directly than his present duties. As I have explained, he is piloting through the House a Bill directly involving Lloyd's. The Minister and his Prime Minister should think carefully about whether his situation falls within the permitted scope of ministerial conflicts of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us on the Floor of the House that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. To clear the matter up, let me say that that is not a matter for me. The matter for me is a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will conclude by making it clear what my point of order is, Sir Michael. I should, however, like the matter to be fully ventilated at this stage in the hope that it can be resolved; if it remains unresolved, I fear that it may bedevil the rest of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a very proper declaration of interest on the Floor of the House, the Minister told us on at least two occasions that he had resigned his membership of a number of syndicates and was no longer carrying out underwriting business. However, he volunteered the information—and confirmed it in answer to a question from me—that he remains a member of Lloyd's. Presumably, he is thus entitled to avail himself of some of the privileges of membership, such as access to the room and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, " And the losses." That is an important intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right. Although the hon. Gentleman's interjection was, I think, out of order, he has brought our attention to something that the Minister would probably say in defence of the position—that he is unable to do more to divest himself of his interest because he remains liable for the next three years or so for the trading losses that might be made by the syndicates of which he was formerly a member. But the corollary of that is that he must also remain the potential beneficiary of any trading profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
That confronts us with the following predicament The Minister is promoting a Bill in which Lloyd's is directly involved, and I am not so critical of Lloyd's as to suggest that every Lloyd's underwriter makes a loss—he will almost certainly derive an income from it over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, possible that the Minister is unable, for legal and contractual reasons, to do more to divest himself of his interest. But I understand that that is not the case, and that arrangements can be made which, while they would not change the Minister's status as a member of Lloyd's, would nevertheless end his liability for losses and his potential gaining of benefits. There are firms which offer various reinsurance and contractual arrangements whereby a name at Lloyd's is able to sell at a discount—which, no doubt, would be a very unattractive proposition—his remaining interest in the syndicates. If the Minister would like some advice about this, I should be happy to give him the name and address of one of those firms. Indeed, let me place on record that Holman Wade Limited would be delighted to discuss such an arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman a member of that firm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have no interest to declare in the matter. I am literally in the position of an honest broker. I am merely trying to ease the Minister's position, to put a little business in the way of Holman Wade Limited and to clear the Committee's path so that it can pursue its own business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my remarks may have been made light-heartedly, I want to make a serious point. We are entitled to expect the Minister to do all that is practically possible, although it may be unpleasant for him, to divest himself of his interests. Although I have not checked the precise circumstances, Peter Cameron-Webb was apparently able to resign and leave the jurisdiction, all in the space of a month or two, and escape the disciplinary arrangements which Lloyd's normally applies to its members. I do not know whether he went to see a firm such as Holmon Wade Limited. But what is possible for Peter Cameron-Webb should surely be possible for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the terms of the Minister's contract may make it impossible for him to cease to be a member of Lloyd's, we need to know whether he has done everything possible to break the link between himself and the financial consequences—whether losses or gains—of his former underwriting activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister has done what is possible, but cannot escape deriving gain from his former membership of Lloyd's, a further question remains. Neither my hon. Friends nor I have any wish to see the Minister give up his responsibilities for the Bill. In many ways he is the ideal person to deal with it. The chances of the Bill becoming a good Act would be much diminished if the Minister were not in charge of it, if only because it would take some

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
time to brief someone else to become familiar with the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have no wish to embarrass the Minister to such an extent that he withdraws from the Committee, but that must be his course unless he can satisfy us that he no longer has a financial interest in Lloyd's. I regard the Minister and other Committee members as the victims of Government insensitivity. This problem should not have arisen, but the facts compel us to raise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We implore the Minister to set the matter right and satisfy us that he has done everything possible to divest himself of his interests, in the knowledge that if he has not done everything possible, or it is impossible to do so, his only proper course is to withdraw from the Committee. My point of order is that, if we felt that those conditions had not been met, I should have to ask you, Sir Michael, to rule that any vote or part that the Minister played in the Committee should be disallowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. May I deal with my position in relation to my membership of Lloyd's to which I have already referred both in the debate on City of London fraud on the Consolidated Fund Bill on the 18 December 1985 and in the debate on Second Reading of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ceased all underwriting at Lloyd's on 2 September, the day on which I was appointed to- the Government, as required by the usual conventions applying to Ministers in my position. I do not wish to enter an argument with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about the conventions to which he referred. He referred to his letter to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I am aware of that letter, and can tell him that he may expect a reply shortly. He will understand that my right hon. Friend has had one or two other matters on her mind in the last few days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time I ceased all underwriting, I ceased to be a member of any of the syndicates in which I previously participated. It is true that I remain a non-underwriting member of Lloyd's, but I have no further business there save for matters arising from pre-existing contracts before they expire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should say a word of explanation about that for those who are unfamiliar with the workings of Lloyd's. Due to the way in which the insurance business works, there is a three-year interval before the results of any underwriting year are declared. For example, the results of my underwriting in 1984, the last full year in which 1 was an underwriting member, will not be declared until some time in 1987. That is why I cannot at this stage indicate the extent of any liabilities that I may have or any profits that I may receive arising out of the contracts into which I entered prior to 2 September 1985. The uncertainty is not merely a matter of time; it is because the profits or losses will be determined largely by commercial forces, over which I have no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
It is interesting to note that what I did in September corresponded exactly to a request made to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). We are sorry that the hon. Gentleman cannot be with us today. We understand from the newspapers the important business that has taken him away. We look forward to his return, which will doubtless bring a request that the end product of his business should be brought within the scope of the Bill. I am sure that it will be of enormous value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wrote a letter to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 11 December, in which he pointed out that my membership of certain Lloyd's syndicates was apparent from the Register of Members' interests. The letter continued:
	<br><q><p>"I would have thought that there was a clear conflict of interest here and that Michael Howard should, if he has not already done so, resign from these syndicates pending the passage of the Bill through Parliament."</p></q>
That was an entirely reasonable point for the hon. Gentleman to make. He has perhaps paid more attention to Lloyd's than have other Opposition Members. I had complied entirely and precisely with his carefully-formulated request three months before that request was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on Second Reading the hon. Member for Dagenham raised a different point, which he has repeated this morning. He asked about my continuing membership, not of the syndicates, but of Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position on resignation from membership of Lloyd's is now governed by byelaw 9 of 1984. That byelaw makes it clear that when an underwriting member wishes to resign, his resignation does not normally take effect until a period of 30 months has elapsed from the day on which the notice is given. I understand that Mr. Peter Cameron-Webb, to whom reference has been made, resigned before that byelaw was introduced. It may be that the circumstances surrounding his resignation had something to do with the introduction of that byelaw and the requirement that resignation should not take effect until a substantial period of time has elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I were able to resign my membership with effect from tomorrow, that would have no effect on my continuing rights and liabilities under the contracts into which I entered before 2 September 1985, for the reasons which I have explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been suggested that I should put matters beyond doubt by disengaging myself from my continuing liabilities. For the reasons that I have given, that is unnecessary. It is not required by the conventions attaching to the conduct of Ministers. The outcome of those matters is determined by commercial forces over which I have no control. But even if a 100 per cent, reinsurance could be found, the primary liability would still be mine. I could disengage myself from that only by approaching everyone with whom a contractual liability had been entered into on my behalf and securing personal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
release from each of them. That is obviously impractical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is a point of principle that concerns the Opposition and as the point of principle is that my personal, primary liability would remain even if I took the step to which the hon. Member for Dagenham has referred, it would not affect or impinge upon that point of principle at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, just as Lloyd's could have its exemption removed by clause 41(1)(Z>), so investment businesses that are subject to the Bill could be exempted by clause 43(l)(a). If Lloyd's were not exempted, the Bill would apply to it in the same way as anything else already covered, so my position is no different from that of any member of the Committee, who has other investments, in the event of the exemption powers being exercised in respect of them. The point is precisely analogous. Is there any hon. Member present who is not, for example, a unit trust holder or insured under a life insurance contract? The nature of any interest is precisely similar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister cannot give way on a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My final point is this. It will not have escaped the attention of my hon. Friends that the position of those Opposition members who have objected to my role in relation to this Bill is extremely odd. Their position is that Lloyd's should be brought within the scope of the Bill. They apparently wish to do this to give greater protection to those underwriting members of Lloyd's, of whom I was one until 2 September 1985, who do not actually work in the market. If I had any relevant interest of the sort that they contend that I have, it would presumably be to increase that protection. In short, I was one of that category of people whom the Opposition in their tender concern are seeking to look after. It makes their objection to my position impossible to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I have no immediate personal interest in the Bill and I hope that that explanation makes my position clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I believe that those matters will have to be dealt with additionally on the Floor of the House. I am not satisfied with the explanation given. At the heart of it was the distinction that the Minister drew between personal, primary liability and what I interpret to mean the immediate liability of those who might acquire his risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fine distinction will not be appreciated by millions of people. The Minister is trying to hide behind very carefully phrased legal terminology which, within the subtleties of legal terminology, he might find satisfactory but which the majority of people will not. The scale of the Minister's interest in these matters probably runs into several hundreds of thousands of pounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish it did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is not; I hope that 	<i>Hansard</i> will record that. We must presume that it is more or perhaps marginally less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister would be out of order if he intervened in the point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, from a sedentary position, the Minister could make a gesture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a substantial interest and to try to equate that with a small insurance policy worth a few hundred pounds taken out by one of my constituents is to misrepresent totally what we are trying to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside die House there is deep anxiety as people believe that Members of Parliament are lining their pockets. Whatever we do, we must diligently assert and prove that that is not so. Anyone reading the report of today's debate will draw the conclusion that an argument took place in a Committee when some Members of Parliament demanded that a Minister should divest himself of an interest and that the Minister, in reply, split a hair in order to retain his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company wrote about divesting to a person who wished to leave Lloyd's:
	<br><q><p>"I understand that you will be resigning your membership of Lloyd's from a certain date, but you may be interested in some form of reinsurance in, order to protect the run-off liability of the open underwriting accounts. In addition, the type of policy that I would have in mind would enable the Lloyd's deposit to be released some time next year provided all matters, were properly in hand.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I do not have details of your open underwriting accounts, therefore if you wish to discuss any further matters with me directly, please do not hesitate to contact me."</p></q>
That letter comes from a company specialising, in part, in divesting. It can be done. The Minister says that it does not have to be done because his " personal primary liability" would not be removed. That is a hair split that the Minister has no right to put to the Committee just as he has no right to demand that the public accept that answer to our question. We know that he stands to benefit, or to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then refers to commercial forces over which he has no control. Is it not possible that the climate that we wish to create in Lloyd's, by way of amendment and dealing perhaps with compensation, to some extent might influence these matters? If it is possible, the Minister can influence that climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's debates are influencing the climate at Lloyd's. That is why there are so many people in the Public Gallery today. They are trying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
to see what attitude the Committee is taking to the problems that we are trying to resolve and to helping them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister that we are engaged in a debate about the climate in the City. The Minister has a pecuniary interest—he cannot split a hair—and I appeal to him to divest himself of his interest in the way that the letter suggests. If he does not do it, he will be perceived to be wrong and as being unreasonable; he may even be perceived to be dishonest when he is not. That is the problem: if people outside die House draw such conclusions, the Minister's actions will have cast a reflection on our proceedings, on all of us and on Parliament. That is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) as he put some of the arguments that I wished to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and the Minister appeared to be approaching the question from an unduly legalistic point of view. That was the impression given by the Minister's speech, and he may have been led to make it by the words of the hon. Member for Dagenham. However, the problem appears to me to be less a legal and more a moral one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister brought in the red herring, the curious canard of unit trusts and life assurance, which proved the reductio ad absurdum he arrived at by taking the legal position so far. The difference is quantitive, if one compares the size of those investments with the Minister's own, even if his investments are not as great as the hon. Member for Workington suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a qualitative difference. One could argue that the constraints on a member of Lloyd's, operating or otherwise, need be no greater than the constraints on those controlling a unit trust or life assurance. But that is patently not the case; Lloyd's already has a series of controls and constraints in place, from which it is clear that the public, the Government and the law view Lloyd's as an entirely different sort of institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that we are dealing with an issue of profound importance. We are beginning to reassure people that we can perhaps re-establish that most precious of invisible assets, the probity of the City. The Bill is directed towards that end: it is constructed to provide ways in which we may clean up the City's reputation and break up the old cartels, private clubs and personal influences which operate against the public interest and against the interest of the City itself. Our capacity to achieve that will be determined not only by the substance of our actions, but by how they are viewed outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of the hon. Member for Dagenham. The Minister's reputation is not in question; it is unimpeachable. Moreover, his personal qualifications to promote the Bill are well recognised. But
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
we are not dealing with personal qualities here. We are dealing with how the legislation will be viewed outside. I take the view that the Minister cannot divest himself of his interest in Lloyd's. In the present circumstances, until the three-year accounting period is up, the Minister has liability for losses and can also receive gains. He is inextricably bound up with Lloyd's. Even if he were to reinsure his liability, primary liability would, as he says, rest with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this with some sorrow, but I see no course open to the Minister other than to withdraw from his position on the Bill. I do not believe that he can divest himself of all his present responsibilities. I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham that the matter in no way rebounds on the Minister; it is characteristic of the Government's insensitivity that he has been put in such a position. There is no point in the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) asking the Minister to take the action that he took in September. At that time the hon. and learned Gentleman was not piloting this Bill through the House; he was merely commenting on circumstances in which he took a ministerial role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important Bill, and any doubt in the public mind about the integrity of the Committee will have an impact on the integrity of the Government. But—much more important—it will have an impact on the integrity of the Bill. If the Minister intends, as he has said, to put on to the statute book an effective Bill which will achieve the aims of all members of the Committee, he must accept that he will only weaken its chances by remaining in his present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our comments have been measured and well researched, and I believe that they reflect opinion outside the House. I hope that the Minister will take serious account of what we have said. If he does not, our proceedings—and the final effect of the Bill—will undoubtedly be weakened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<b>SEVERAL HON. MEMBERS</b> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call other hon. Members, I wish to make it clear that this debate is on a point of order. Discussions about whether the Minister's attitude is right or wrong are not a matter for me. I have allowed the debate to continue for some time because I think it right that we should get the matter out of our systems from the word go. However, I cannot allow indefinite discussion developing the subject of what might almost be regarded as moral attitudes. That has nothing to do with the Chair or its ruling. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will debate the point of order strictly as a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. You have been typically generous in allowing time for debate on this matter because you rightly recognise that it is one of no little importance. Indeed, I believe that if your ruling on the point of order went against the Minister, a damaging precedent would be set. It is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
source of reassurance to Conservative Members that two Ministers are serving on this Committee—a useful reinsurance should the ruling go against my hon. and learned Friend. Clearly the matter did not fall within my hon. and learned Friend's powers; it was decided by the Committee of Selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the points made by the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) are worthy of a response. The hon. Member for Dagenham went a little bit over the top when he said that it was scandalous of the Government to field a Minister with an alleged conflict of interests and urged my hon. and learned Friend to sell off his remaining interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that our discussion revolves around whether non-underwriting membership of Lloyd's gives rise to—or appears to give rise to—a conflict of interests. We are talking about a passive rather than an active interest in this case, because my hon. and learned Friend has relinquished all active control. It is important that all hon. Members should protect their right and that of Ministers to retain their interests?—even if they are passive interests. While there is a proper requirement that Ministers of the Crown should relinquish executive control over their interests, there is no requirement for them to relinquish or convert assets or investments simply because they are Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Ministers and members of the Government retain substantial interests in companies. One of my hon. Friends—he is probably the richest man in the House—has a substantial shareholding in a large retail group. The fact that that shareholding is large makes it no more or less the subject of a point of principle. Other Ministers have substantial interests in businesses. Let us take the example of a Minister who owns a farm, and let us suppose that he relin quishes control or management of that farm to a farmer manager. Is he really then to be required to relinquish his ownership in order to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now getting on to all sorts of questions that do not relate directly to the point of order. I have been giving the matter considerable thought ever since the Second Reading debate, as I am sure the Committee would have expected me to do. I ask hon. Members to make their points directly with points of order. I think that brevity would assist all of us in keeping the points in our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Sir Michael, and I shall try to observe that ruling. I simply sought to answer some of the allegations erroneously put by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister's position was entirely vindicated by his reply this morning. He has shown us that he has gone as far as he should in relinquishing his interest and that no conflict arises from it. The Minister said that even if he defrayed his ongoing liability or sold off potential profits by getting rid of his remaining interests, the primary liability would remain with him; that is inescapable. In my view that wholly vindicates him. Therefore, both in this case and as a general point of principle,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
it is most important that we should not allow these points of order to be acceded to by you today, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. Many of the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) fell well outside the purview of the point of order. For example, the Churchill-Butler rules do not seem to have much to do with the question before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real questions affecting our proceedings concern the declaration of interest—and an interest has been declared in this case—and, especially, the question of voting on matters affected by personal pecuniary interests. Those are well set out in " Erskine May" and arise from the ruling by Mr. Speaker Abbot in 1811, upon which there have been a number of precedents. The Minister's comments fall full square between the four walls of the rulings made in the past. In the interests of brevity, I do not intend to go into those matters as I am sure that you, Sir Michael, have been concerned with them and have given thought to them. If a matter does arise, I hope that you will not rule the other way and that the matter will be pursued. There are numerous precedents to which I intend to refer later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael, raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), about the propriety of my hon. and learned Friend's voting in the proceedings. Conservative Members accept every word of the Minister's statement and endorse the full force of his comments. There can be no question of the Minister standing to benefit—or to lose—from the outcome of any measures that may be included in the Bill because we know that they cannot conceivably affect the period during which my hon. and learned Friend had an active interest as an underwriting member of a syndicate at Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if that were not the case, the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham is not valid. He insisted that the minimum requirement would be that my hon. and learned Friend should not vote. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) asserted, in his characteristically more colourful way, that the public are anxious that hon. Members are .lining their pockets, and he bandied around figures of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

There is a precedent for hon. Members, including Opposition Members, voting on an issue of public policy in which they have a direct and personal pecuniary interest. I refer to the votes that took place in the House on 19 July 1983, about hon. Members' pay, when, as I understand it, all Committee members voted, except my hon. Friends the Members for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), and for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward), and the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). Indeed, the hon. Member for Workington voted twice that his pay should be linked with that of a civil servant earning £18,500. The hon. Gentleman may not enjoy as long a parliamentary career as he wishes, but, none the

less, in a reasonable anticipation of his period of service in the House, he may stand to benefit by hundreds of thousands of pounds from that vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members' attitude to the matter is therefore hypocritical, opportunistic, frivolous and obstructionist. They underestimate the good common sense of the British people who will accept the propriety of my hon. and learned Friend's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. I have listened carefully to Opposition Members' representations and I do not doubt the sincerity with which they are made. But their point of order must surely fail because it arises from their wish that Lloyd's should be included in the scope of the Bill, when clearly it is not. We can consider only what is in the Bill and not what some Opposition Members might like to see in the Bill if they had drafted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. I have every confidence in my hon. and learned Friend, and, on the basis of the comments of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), he is complying with the rules laid down for Ministers in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham talked about conflicts of interest. I agree with him that that is what the debate on the Bill and the Minister's position is about. We propose to deal with such conflicts by ensuring that clients' accounts are separated from the accounts of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September, on the day that he was appointed a Minister, my hon. and learned Friend set aside his interests in such a way that he has no control over their future fortunes. My hon. and learned Friend is right—every member of the Committee has an interest in the Bill. It is inconceivable that there is a member of the Committee who does not have a policy or investment that is governed by the terms of the Bill. Opposition Members say that it is a question of scale, but it is not. I could have equity holdings of £1 million and life cover of £500,000. Unfortunately I do not, but there is nothing to prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of scale but one of principle. On that, I am quite clear that my hon. and learned Friend has complied with the rules that have been explained to us. We have been told that the rules say that no conflict should arise or be seen to arise. The question is by whom. Is it by Opposition Members or by the reasonable man? The reasonable man would say that my hon. and learned Friend has complied. One reasonable man, the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore), as we have already heard, wrote to the Prime Minister about this in September. He wrote:
	<br><q><p>" Michael Howard should… resign from these syndicates pending the passage of the Bill through Parliament."</p></q>
I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is listening because the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch referred in his letter to the fact that my hon. and learned Friend would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
be taking the Bill through Parliament. That deals with the point he raised in his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasonable man would ask what difference it can make to my hon. and learned Friend's position. Fie can have no influence over whether he makes profits or incurs losses. It is therefore not unreasonable that he should, on behalf of the Government, pilot the Bill through the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael, I had not intended to rise in this debate but the passionate attempt of Conservative Members to defend the indefensible and the fact that I was unable to intervene in the Minister's speech has changed my mind. I wanted to refer to a letter that I wrote to the Prime Minister on the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My interpretation of the rules of the House as laid out in " Erskine May " concerning the registration of interests, the declaration of interests and the duties of the registrar is that they should be taken in tandem with the rules for ministerial interests. They are rules for Members, and we are asked to take it for granted that the ministerial rules have been properly applied in respect of the interests of Ministers. The two are therefore essential faces of the same operation. The ministerial rules impose particular requirements on Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My letter to the Prime Minister asked whether the ministerial rules have been applied and enforced in this case. Those ministerial rules have a direct bearing on whether it is right and responsible for a Minister with an interest in a subject to argue that case in Committee. The ministerial rules are straightforward on this point. They state:
	<br><q><p>" All Ministers are therefore required on appointment, whether to their first or any subsequent Ministerial office, to obtain the permission of the Prime Minister before continuing a connection with Lloyd's, however nominal"—</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that the ministerial rules have nothing to do with this point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my argument, and I accept the correction, that they are relevant in respect of whether the Minister should responsibly participate in the sittings of the Committee that deal with Lloyd's. I should like to conclude this brief extract from the ministerial rules. The document is marked " confidential" so I shall read it more loudly in conformity with Government practice. Ministers are required to obtain the Prime Minister's permission
	<br><q><p>" before continuing a connection with Lloyd's, however nominal, which they had established before appointment or establishing any such connection during their term of appointment. Before granting permission, the Prime Minister will need to be satisfied that the conditions indicated above will be met."</p></q>
I asked the Prime Minister whether those procedures had been complied with in relation to this Minister, and whether—even if they had been—it was responsible of the Minister—in respect of whom I endorse every comment made by my hon. Friends——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot ask the Minister that question and remain within the point of order, which is whether an hon. Member is in order within the Committee and within " Erskine May".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, Sir Michael. I have not had a reply from the Prime Minister and so cannot say what the Government's view is. However, the Minister cannot have it both ways as he attempted in his speech. We believe that he can go further than he has done in divesting himself of his interest. It might not be a complete divestment—I do not know the technicalities, as I know very little or what goes on at Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not answered the argument that he should go further than he has done. Indeed, his reply was defiant. He said that essentially all Members have some kind of interest, which is to equate my interest with that of the Minister. My interest, valued at £250, is in the fund for European growth without failure, investing in countries outside the Common Market in which one can have faith because one is an anti-European. However, the Minister's interest might amount to several thousand pounds a year in an area in which we shall be attempting to legislate, and with which the Bill deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join other hon. Members in asking the Minister either to take further steps to divest himself of his interests or not to participate in those parts of the Bill in which we shall be attempting to apply the procedures for regulation in the Bill to Lloyd's, a major area that requires regulation. If only as a matter of taste, it would not be right for a Minister with an interest to lead the debate and state the argument for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Perhaps you would reconsider your ruling that the document affecting Ministers would not affect my hon. Friend's point of order. I am a member of the Select Committee on Members' Interests, along with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ash-down), in which we deal with the questions of registration by all Members. According to that Committee, Ministers and their interests are covered by the memorandum that the Minister has before him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is the Committee's unwritten recommendation that Ministers' interests are dealt with in the memorandum. The memorandum is part and parcel of any debate that takes place on the registration of Members' interests, and the circumstances surrounding the registration of their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask you to reconsider your ruling, Sir Michael, or to take further advice. If your ruling must remain, the hon. Member for Yeovil and I would have to go back to our Committee and report it. It means that an area into which we have traditionally refused to enter is a matter where the House must, as of today, take an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never thought that that was necessary. I thought that such matters could be raised on the Floor of the House in the normal way, but your
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
ruling today, Sir Michael, has been recorded and there is a danger that it may follow the same course as that given when my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was given a ruling in a Committee and then used it to seek a further ruling on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking not for an immediate retraction of your ruling, Sir Michael, but that you should reconsider your decision, because it has wider implications and may change the terms of reference of the Select Committee on Members' Interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly read the record and give the matter due consideration. All I was seeking to do was to make it quite clear that I am not in a position to see whether or not anyone has carried out the ministerial rules, nor is it a question, as I see it, for the Committee to do so, but I shall look at what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter that we are discussing is different. It has been broadened in that, along with the direct point of order, other matters have been introduced appealing for the Minister to take a different approach. That is rather different from the strict point of order that has been put to me and on which 1 must adjudicate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has drawn your attention to an important matter which goes to the heart of the issue that we are discussing. Much of the special pleading from Conservative Members was on the basis that the Minister was in no different a position from any other hon. Member. That is an important issue for you to rule on, Sir Michael, because as a matter of common sense—even if it is not, evidently, a matter of the rules of the House— the position of a Minister promoting a Bill in which a contentious issue is being debated and in which he has an interest is rather different from that of an hon. Member merely participating in a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Sir Michael, that you will look carefully at my hon. Friend's point about the relevance of ministerial rules to declarations of interests and voting capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major argument put forward by those who sought to defend the Minister's position was that his membership of Lloyd's was no different from taking out a life insurance policy or making a small investment in a unit trust. Here, the existence of ministerial rules seems to be directly relevant because the fact that those rules single out someone who is a name at Lloyd's demonstrates that that is a special situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Minister who is piloting a Bill through the House while he is a member of Lloyd's cannot be said to be in the same position as someone who votes on agricultural matters and has an interest in a farm. It is self-evident—ministerial rules make it clear—that this is a different and rather special situation. Even if he were to accept some of the ambit of the principle enunciated by my hon. Friend,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
it is no coincidence that the hon. Gentleman to whom the hon Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) referred would not serve on the Shops Bill Committee. That is a good illustration of our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with two points that the Minister made in his attempted rebuttal when I urged you to rule on the point of order, Sir Michael. The Minister reiterated what he had said on the Floor of the House; there has been no change since then. Letters from my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and myself to the Prime Minister produced no result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the Minister's argument is that although his interest is clearly commercial and could lead to substantial gain, or loss, nothing remains within his control that could affect the outturn which would depend on a range of commercial factors over which he has no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, what happens in the Committee will undeniably have a commercial impact on the detailed figures on the cheque that arrives in the Minister's hands. The Minister may say that that is a sweeping assertion, but I can give the Committee a precise instance. If Lloyd's were to decide, as a consequence of the pressure put upon it by the Committee, or if it were to be compelled by virtue of being brought within the Bill, to meet its responsibilities in the cases of losses run up by, for example, the PCW syndicate, the Minister and every other member of Lloyd's would find that his cheque had been reduced by the contribution that he would have to make towards meeting those losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be a hypothesis, but it is a real one. Few members of this Committee would lay money against that outcome. It is, therefore, plainly wrong for the Minister to argue that there is nothing in the Bill— over which he has control—that would affect the outturn of his commercial interests in his syndicates. If the Minister disagrees with me, I hope that he will explain his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, rather touchingly I thought, referred to the letter written to the Prime Minister by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). He made great play of the fact that he has met the conditions laid down in that letter. We all know that my hon. Friend is a great authority on these matters and I hope that the Minister will be as ready to defer to that authority on other issues as he is on this. However, I do not believe that you, Sir Michael, would regard my hon. Friend as having the last word on the issue which you have to decide. Nor would the Minister or the Prime Minister take a similar view on the ministerial rules which have entered into the debate, perhaps improperly, from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a false argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch is not omniscient, and he could not in his letter of 8 or 15 December—or whenever—necessarily have understood the full range of difficulties raised by the Minister's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
I conclude, Sir Michael, by restating my fundamental point. Almost everything that has been said on the point of order, since I first raised it, has been wide of the mark. My contention is that however persuasively the Minister had been able to satisfy us that he had done everything he could to divest himself of his interests, he is telling us now that he retains a commercial interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A substantial interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says a substantial interest, and perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on the size of the interest. If he is a member of three or four syndicates with a minimum investment of £100,000 each, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington is not so wide of the mark when he talks of £500,000 of capital invested in the enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot do more to divest himself of his interest, although I do not believe that is so, another option beckons him, indeed demands his compliance—he must withdraw from the Committee. If he cannot escape from his dilemma by moving in one direction, he must move in the other. If he were to do otherwise, not only would it be outside the rules that you, Sir Michael have to apply, but it would be a bad augury for the seriousness of purpose with which he and his hon. Friends approach the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. May I deal briefly with the one point raised specifically by the hon. Member for Dagen-ham (Mr. Gould)—as opposed to the points which he raised, but which had already been dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that, having been brought into the scope of the Bill, Lloyd's would be in a position to' meet its responsibilities in regard to the PCW syndicates, and that I might conceivably have an interest in the matter. But nothing in the Bill has a retrospective application. Even if Lloyd's were brought into its scope, its attitude to PCW losses would not be affected. The hon. Gentleman's point, like so many others that he has made, is a thoroughly bad one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. I am sorry, but I fear that I must comment on the Minister's remarks for your enlightenment. I used the PCW syndicates as an example which already exists. But the Minister is being disingenuous when he tries to rely on the Bill having no retrospective effect. He has made great play of the fact that his own liabilities are prospective, and that there is nothing that he can do about them. They extend for three years into the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing that the liability to meet losses— and how can the Minister say that no further losses in cases such as the PCW syndicates will arise over that three-year period?—would be directly affected if Lloyd's were brought within the Bill and subjected to the same statutory arrangements for compensation and so on. I should be surprised if any hon. Member disputed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cited the example of the PCW syndicates because it is a concrete rather than hypothetical example
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
of the sort of thing which will almost certainly arise in the next three years. If Lloyd's is subjected to these rules, such a development will have a direct commercial implication for the Minister and for every other member of Lloyd's who remains liable for losses, or able to take benefits, over that period. Surely that is incontrovertible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have drafted the Bill in such a way as to bring Lloyd's, in principle, within the Bill, and have then found it necessary to exclude Lloyd's from the Bill by means of a specially-drafted clause—clause 40. Whether we decide to let the clause stand part of the Bill will directly affect the size of the cheque or bill that the Minister will receive at some point—indeed, on several occasions —during the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am profoundly disappointed that this remains a matter of dispute. While I feel much sympathy for the Minister, I believe that he and his hon. Friend's owe it to the Committee, and to> the community outside who want the Bill to work effectively, to make it clear from the outset that they recognise the untenability of the Minister's position. I ask you, Sir Michael, to rule in a way that will encourage the Minister to' do his duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. The previous point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) concerned a different case. During the course of those earlier remarks, the Minister dissented; then, at the end of my hon. Friend's point of order, he rose to oppose. Would he care to rise to oppose the point of order that my hon. Friend just raised? If he does not, the matter will become the subject of a further point of order on the Floor of the House. Perhaps he would like to qualify my hon. Friend's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) cited a specific example that he had not previously cited. I rose to point out that it was a bad point. The hon. Gentleman then moved away from that example to a general point about the effect of the introduction of a compensation fund or a system of regulation as a matter which I had dealt with previously. Such arrangements apply in precisely the same way to someone who has a unit trust or a life assurance policy. In every case the arrangements that may be made under the Bill for the purposes of compensation or other costs apply. The analogy is precise. I felt no need to' respond further because I had dealt with the point in my original remarks, and I rose this time at the express invitation of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have deliberately allowed the points of order to continue for a considerable time because they concern a very important matter about which members of the Committee clearly feel strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard the Second Reading debate—and anticipating that I might be where I am—I took
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
steps first to consider very carefully what had been said and secondly to take advice wherever I could. Armed with that advice, with my own reflections and thoughts and with my readings of "Erskine May", I waited to hear what hon. Members had to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that it is not for the Chair to pronounce upon ministerial rules concerning the financial interests of members of the Government. That is a separate matter and it is not one for me. The occupant of the Chair is concerned only with the question whether an hon. Members' pecuniary interest is so direct and personal as to cause him to permit a motion that hon. Members' vote on a clause, once case, should be disallowed. That is the matter I have to consider. The Chair has no power to direct in advance that an hon. Member should not cast his vote, any motion, if allowed, must come afterwards. Neither has the Chair the power to direct that a member of the Committee shall withdraw from the Committee. We ought to get that background straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also remind hon. Members that this is a Public Bill and not a Private Bill; hon. Members who have studied this matter will realise that there are many differences between the two. I remind them, too, that " Erskine May" is very clear on this matter and that one must be guided by it. It states:
	<br><q><p>" No Member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question is allowed to vote upon it; but, in order to operate as a disqualification, this interest must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character."</p></q>
As many hon. Members know, Mr. Speaker Abbot explained the rule in 1811, and his explanation appears on page 407 of " Erskine May ":
	<br><q><p>" This interest must be a direct pecuniary interest, and separately belonging to the persons whose votes were questioned, and not in common with the rest of his Majesty's subjects, or on a matter of state policy."</p></q>
That is the basis on which I listened to the debate. In my earlier consideration, I had thought of all possible alternatives that might present themselves, and I have heard many of them today. I am bound to say that I heard nothing that I—or those with whom I discussed matters; I do not wish to appear omniscient—had not already thought of; I put that point to show that I have given the utmost consideration to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise two other matters: first, the clear declaration made by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Under-Secretary and, secondly, the Speaker's ruling on Second Reading when he said:
	<br><q><p>"I give my ruling. On matters of public policy, it is in order for an hon. Member to cast his vote."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 January 1986; Vol. 89, c. 1016.]</p></q>
Clearly, I am bound to give very great weight to that ruling. Indeed, perhaps I might say that I have to accept it, but, none the less, I have tried to think the matter through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have gone into the background as far as possible, and I do not propose to go into the details of all the points of order raised. The hon. and learned Gentleman has assured the Committee that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
he has no direct pecuniary interest which would prevent him voting on any part of the Bill. Naturally, I accept that assurance and shall not, therefore, permit any motions to disallow the hon. and learned Gentleman's vote on those grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I thank you for the careful consideration that you have given to the ruling. I need scarcely express Opposition Members' disappointment at your decision. However, that disappointment does not reflect on the rules which you felt obliged to interpret, but rather on the attitudes of Conservative Members and particularly the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me ask you to clarify one point. You pointed out, Sir Michael, that, at least at this stage, you have no power—nor would it be appropriate for anyone—to move that a vote be disallowed; that motion could be entertained only after a vote had been cast. But, in your concluding remark, you suggested that no motion to that effect would be permitted. As a demonstration of Opposition Members' anxiety about this matter, I hope to catch your eye at the appropriate moment to move such a motion, even if you were to say that it was out of order, or that, for some reason, it could not be moved. I ask for that point to be clarified because Opposition Members wish to make a further demonstration of our dissatisfaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have, of course, thought that one through before. Some hon. Members were engaged in exploring the same procedure in the 1982 Finance Bill Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to give the ruling and make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that, although he is entitled to seek to move a motion, it is within my powers to accept that or deny it. In view of the information that I have so far, and on the basis of the discussion on the point of order that has taken place today, I would not be disposed to accept the hon. Gentleman's motion. But, clearly, I cannot rule out all possibilities. That is why I framed my answer in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I seek not to question your ruling, but to raise a point of order. I emphasise our gratitude for your ruling and for the careful consideration behind it. However, the nature of that ruling puts the Back Bencher in an impossible position against the Executive and it places the Opposition in a difficult position against the Government. Implicit in the argument is the problem of the ministerial rules, which are an essential part of " Erskine May".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If, as he tells me, the hon. Gentleman is not questioning my ruling, the matter is at an end. I have no doubt that there will be other occasions when the hon Gentleman can raise those matters. So far as I have heard, his argument cannot be raised on a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is simply this: how are we to know whether the ministerial rules have been complied with? We have written to the Prime

Minister to find out. They are an essential part of the argument and of the prima facie case. The Minister is speaking on a subject in which he still has an interest. The prima facie indications are that the ministerial rules have not been complied with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. It is not for me to say whether the hon. and learned Gentleman, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, has fulfilled the ministerial rules so I can give no ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. May I clarify your ruling precisely? You have ruled on the aspect that affects Members' interests.

Would it be in order for a point of order to be raised in Committee? I am not asking out of disbelief. I wish to know precisely what the answer is. Would it be in order for a member of the Committee to raise a point of order on the ministerial rules as they relate to the Minister dealing with the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for my ruling. The hon. Gentleman must seek his own guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I am perfectly willing to wait for a ruling, but I put it to you that this is a matter for you. I have asked whether something is in order. The answer is either that it is in order or that it is not in order. I seek only one of those answers. I do not mind waiting for it, but I should like to receive it. The answer will determine what actions my hon. Friends take on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to get the matter entirely clear, will the hon. Gentleman put his question once again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is: would it be in order for my hon. Friends and me to raise points of order on the position of the Minister who is dealing with the Bill and on his need to comply with ministerial rules on the declaration of interest as set out in the memorandum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman wants to know whether it would be in order to raise the matter in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

seems hypothetical at present. If there is a point of order relating to the Committee I shall consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael, I should be grateful for a word of clarification on your decision and the arguments which supported it. I think you said that, in your view, the Minister's connections with Lloyd's did not represent a direct pecuniary interest which is why you could not let the point of order stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You went on, Sir Michael, to say that your reason for that decision was that the Minister assured you that his connections did not represent a pecuniary interest. I think that the record will show that that was what you said. Surely, Sir Michael, and I ask this simply for clarification, the determining factor is not the subjective judgment of the person concerned that he does not believe that this has a direct pecuniary interest, but the objective view taken by yourself and others. The fact that the Minister said that in his view he has no direct pecuniary interest in this matter should not determine your judgment on it; that should depend on your objective view of whether the money that he may receive from Lloyd's or the losses that he may suffer as a result of his connection give him a direct pecuniary interest. Is that not the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could expand on my ruling although I stick to the original ruling. Clearly, the Minister's statement is backed up by other things that he said. Ultimately, backed up by background statements, he said that he had no direct, personal pecuniary interest which would prevent him voting on any part of the Bill. Both his statement and the facts as they have been outlined to me led to the decision that I took.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. I fear that this matter could be extended quite unnaturally. You have made your ruling. It is fully within the provisions set out here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Order. I do not want support for my ruling. All I want is a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. You quoted, if I remember, the passage from Mr. Speaker Abbot in which he defined direct pecuniary interest. You then went on to say, and I think that you reinforced it in what you have just said, that the prime determinant was whether the Minister had made certain statements to say that he had or had not got—in this case had not— a pecuniary interest in this matter and certain other statements to back that up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case it puts Opposition Back Benchers in an appalling position. We have no other argument to make against a Minister who merely makes the bland statement, "I have no pecuniary interest in this matter." Our case is automatically ruled out of order. Surely, Sir Michael, you must make an objective judgment whether the Minister has a direct pecuniary interest here, according to the definitions laid down by Mr. Speaker Abbot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Can I turn away from the ministerial rules which I shall return to on the Floor, because there is still some grey area which is not worth pursuing in Committee. A lot more advice needs to be taken on these matters. The Minister has made his position clear. As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Member going to make a point of order or is he simply seeking to give notice that he will raise something on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I understand it, the Registrar is in a position to examine complaints.

I should like to see the Registrar carry out an inquiry to determine to what extent we have a case for raising these matters on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(2) The Secretary of State may specify in respect of any person that he is an authorised person for the purposes of carrying out an investment business of the kind which falls within any of the paragraphs in Part II of Schedule I but not in respect of the remaining or any of the other kinds of investment business which fall within those paragraphs.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that it has taken us so long to reach this stage in our proceedings. I hope that the time that we have spent so far on an important issue will not necessarily indicate the pace at which we intend to proceed on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not entirely a coincidence that the subject which we have been debating for the past hour and three-quarters—conflicts of interests—? immediately arises again in the amendments. They are tabled as probing amendments, although they have a more serious purpose than is sometimes me case with probing amendments. They are designed to require the Minister to let us into his thinking about the means by which some important and obvious conflicts of interest are to be avoided under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, which may have drafting deficiencies, may be unnecessary by virtue by some of the Bill's other provisions, though that is not immediately clear from my reading of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the amendments is to discover whether authorisation to carry out one type of investment business identified and defined in paragraph 2 of schedule 1 is automatically to be regarded as authorisation for all of them. The purpose of the amendment is to invite the Minister to say whether he agrees that it would be desirable for a power to remain to distinguish between those different types of investment business, and whether he believes that the Bill is intended to empower him or any other authorising body to make that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fundamentally important issue, which concerned Professor Gower. I think mat the solution apparently produced in the Bill is close to what he would accept. However, other people, in the City and elsewhere, are not as satisfied that the Bill, or certainly clause 1, makes the point as clear as it ought to be, or makes it clear at all. Certainly provisions such as clause 10(3) in respect of self-regulating organisations, and perhaps provisions such as claue 25(2)	<i>(b)</i> bear on this question to some degree, but they do not make it possible to make that rigid distinction which I think in some cases should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground that problems of conflict of interest are at the heart of the Bill, quite apart from the difficulty we discussed earlier. To sum up, the Bill is designed to minimise conflicts of interest in a new and rapidly developing service. The City evolving before our eyes will be a very different City, in which the possibility of conflict of interest will be much greater. Some of the institutional safeguards— for example, those separating the jobber from the broker—will no longer exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
The thrust of the revolution is towards the establishment of large financial conglomerates offering a range of services. Consumers will be offered one-stop shopping. In the City of the immediate future, conflicts of interest will not be guarded by institutional arrangements, but will be positively encouraged. Conflict of interest will be built into particular institutions as part of the wares offered to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading many hon. Gentlemen mentioned that the rules governing such questions had yet to be published. We do not yet know what detailed provision will be made to guard against incipient difficulties. For example, there is much talk about Chinese walls. I am rapidly accumulating a fund of acerbic remarks about them. Professor Gower opined that every Chinese wall that he had seen had a grapevine trailing over it. That was a most perceptive remark. Chinese walls always remind me of those self-standing silk screens, whose major characteristic is that although people cannot see what is happening on the other side, they can hear everything. I shall not repeat other comments because of their somewhat racist nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not yet know how Chinese walls or any other device or principle about best execution and subordination of personal interests will be implemented. The Bill fails to give the Secretary of State, the Securities and Investments Board or whatever body is to exercise those powers the ability to impose separation of functions at the outset, in the process of authorisation. I want to avoid the danger that, without such an ability, there may be no separation. In some instances separation will be essential to the proper protection of investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least I want to ensure that, irrespective of whether an applicant is a member of an SRO or is seeking direct authorisation, the Secretary of State can authorise the applicant to manage an investment fund but not to deal or to arrange deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite that example because it is the most pressing one. There is a good deal of unease in the City that people who are rightly brought within the ambit of the Bill because they manage investments will be authorised, with no let or hindrance, to deal in the same investments that they manage. It is a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that there are recent instances in die City of institutions that already encompass such a range of activities touting for business—or at least putting their case for being well placed to manage investment funds—on die basis that, for example, they also underwrite issues. They have inside track knowledge to place favourable issues with the fund if they can get the job of managing it. There is a conjunction of function between managing and advising on an investment fund on the one hand and dealing or arranging deals on the other, but they are separate functions which, in principle, should be kept separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister, in the absence of the detailed rules, that the Bill should include at least the possibility of an obstacle or barrier being set up in principle between those functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
I believe that thinking along those lines has occasionally animated the debate in other countries on such issues. For example, under the Johnson Administration in the United States, a Bill was prepared which aimed to provide exactly such separation of functions. However, the advent of the new Administration, which perhaps had closer connections with the financial community, meant the end of that enterprise. Another example is Sweden, which has legislative rules setting out that separation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments seek not to> provide a mandatory separation, but to recognise the possibility of such a barrier being established in appropriate cases. It is possible that, after we have heard the Minister's comments, and when we reach the authorisation of provisions in the Bill, we may want to tighten the provision or relax it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept this as a probing amendment which raises an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me respond to the important point of principle which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has made. There is little between us regarding the objective to be attained. On analysis, there may prove to be little between us regarding the method used to gain that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes that all authorised persons must be restricted to carrying out those kinds of investment business which they are competent to undertake. I believe that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman's point of principle. But the Bill also proposes that the decision should be taken by the regulator. It is for the regulator to decide which kinds of investment business an authorised person is competent to undertake. For example, someone who applies for authorisation because he wants to do insurance broking should not be able to deal in commodity futures without the regulator considering that he is fit to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides one way of achieving that objective; the amendments suggest an alternative approach. The hon. Gentleman has also mentioned precedents in other countries. There is an essential difference between the approaches suggested by the Bill and the amendments. The amendments rely on the criminal law while the Bill relies on the enforcement of rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An applicant can be granted direct authorisation if he appears to be a fit and proper person to carry on the investment business described in his application. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State or a designated agency will be able to require him to give notice if he wants to undertake any activities not covered in the application. If the supervisor is not satisfied that the person is competent to carry on the new activities and the person concerned is not prepared voluntarily to drop his plans, the supervisor can use his intervention powers under Chapter VI to stop the person undertaking those activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Breach of either such a prohibition or the notification requirement would be grounds for disciplinary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
action by the supervisor, up to and including withdrawal of authorisation in a serious case. It would also give rise to a right of action by any investor who had suffered loss as a result of the breach of the rule or prohibition. Alternatively, the supervisor could seek an injunction or restitution order from the courts. There is therefore quick and effective action that the supervisor can take to enforce the rules restricting the activities carried on by an authorised business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, recognised self-regulating organisations and professional bodies will be required to have, and to enforce, rules restricting the activities carried on by their members. That is the system proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative approach contemplated in the amendments is to rely on the criminal law. An investment business could be required to obtain separate authorisation for each of its main types of activity. Alternatively, as proposed in the amendments, it could be authorised to carry on all types of investment business except specified activities. In either case, breach of the restriction would be a criminal offence, and a new authorisation would be required before the business could legitimately undertake any activities even marginally outside the existing authorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully, but I am not certain that I am following the Minister. Amendment No. 13 seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State " may specify", not must specify. The requirement would not be in place all the time, and would not introduce the criminal law on every occasion; it would merely leave to the Minister the reserve power to specify if he should so wish. In those circumstances, the people whom he specifies would become subject to criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to be saying that this would be a blanket provision which would apply to the whole Bill. Surely that is not the intention of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction between the two methods of approach that I am describing holds good. It is true that the amendments do not require the Minister to act in a particular way, but they contemplate an approach resting on the criminal law. The Secretary of State is not obliged to make any specific exceptions or restrictions or to specify any particular activities, but the vehicle contemplated in the amendment is the criminal law; the vehicle contemplated in the Bill is reliance on the regulator in the way that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the broad distinction that the Minister is drawing between the two approaches, but is he not slightly overstating the case? Apart from the point raised, rightly, by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) it is true that under the system proposed in the amendments there would be direct recourse to the criminal law because failure to comply with the authorisation would involve a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
However, even under the Bill the criminal law will enforce the rules—but at one step removed. Failure to comply with the rules of the SROs will mean that the conducting of certain types of investment business would be without authorisation and the criminal law will come into play as an offence will have been committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite like that. May I seek to put the hon. Gentleman right? The criminal law would come into play in the situation postulated by the hon. Member only if authorisation had been removed altogether. Carrying on investment business without authorisation would be contrary to the criminal law. If, however, a person engages in investment business other than that for which he has had authorisation—but he has been authorised to undertake some investment business—it would be in breach of the rules and would attract the remedies that I have just identified. But it would not, ipso facto, constitute a breach of the criminal law. That is the distinction between the approaches in the amendments and in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil appeared to suggest that even if the general approach were to rely on the rules, there should be some reserve power to enable the Secretary of State—exceptionally—to withdraw or restrict—exceptionally—the activities directly. There is power in the Bill to enable the Secretary of State to restrict the activities carried on by an authorised investment business when it is desirable to do so for the protection of investors. Clauses 59 and 60 allow the Secretary of State in such circumstances to prohibit an authorised person from entering into transactions of any specified kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Breaches of a prohibition will be grounds for disciplinary action, and action by any investors who suffer loss as a result of it. The Secretary of State could intervene—exceptionally—by using the powers in clauses 59 and 60, but within the context of the general approach that I have identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is that distinction between the two approaches—one relying on the criminal law and the other on the remedies available to deal with a breach of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain why we have rejected the approach that relies on the criminal law. First the divisions between the various kinds of investment business inevitably involve an arbitrary element. One type of investment activity may merge with a similar one, as in the case of investment advice and investment management. There are few clear-cut boundaries, and we feel that vague boundaries should not form the basis of the definition of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, one has to consider the severity of the penalties involved. If the categories are defined in statute and someone inadvertently strays across an arbitrary boundary, he will become an offender liable to criminal penalties, and the contracts in which he has engaged will be rendered unenforceable, with all the uncertainty that that entails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, criminal penalties should be reserved for the more serious offence of carrying on invest-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
ment business without any authorisation. Once a business has been authorised, the more flexible range of penalties for breaches of rules are more appropriate and can be adapted according to the seriousness of the breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—and most important—enforcement will be quicker and more effective if it relies on disciplinary and similar remedies rather than on the criminal law, with its higher standards of proof, strict evidential rules and the need to go to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our final reason for rejecting the approach suggested in the amendments concerns its administrative implications. If a business has to obtain separate authorisation for each of its main types of investment business, unnecessary bureaucracy and form-filling will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore believe that the approach adopted in the Bill, which relies on the regulator's decision about whether an investment business should be authorised to carry on certain kinds of investment activity is to be preferred to an approach relying on the criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Miinster for his explanation. He is right to say that we share the same objective, but I suspect that our approach differs on the best way of achieving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While Labour Members—I do not know whether I can speaker for the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown)—see great merit in relying on the rules applied and monitored by SROs, we also believe that in an uncertain situation it would be valuable to have the clearest possible rules to deal with these important matters. That is why we tabled the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a broad distinction between direct recourse to the criminal law, as contemplated in the amendments, and the application of the rules of SROs, as laid down in the Bill. However, I cannot help thinking that once the rules have been applied, the criminal law will provide the ultimate sanction—even under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged in that view by what Professor Gowers said in paragraph 4: D8 of Part II of his report. In relation to the proposals in the White Paper, which have now largely been incorporated in the Bill, he said:
	<br><q><p>" This would mean that a broker who was registered through membership of agency A, which did not cover dealings in futures "—</p></q>
Professor Gower is speaking hypothetically here—
	<br><q><p>" and who was not a member of the AFBD, which did, would not commit a criminal offence by transacting for a client a deal in futures but he would be liable to expulsion from Agency A "—</p></q>
One would assume that to be the normal consequence if the rules were being applied correctly.
	<br><q><p>" with the result that he would thereafter commit a criminal offence if he carried on any type of investment business".</p></q>
The argument is that the criminal law is the last resort, to be used to enforce or back up the application of the rules. So while I agree that there is a substantial difference of approach, I believe that in both cases the criminal law will count in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
I am not entirely reassured by the Minister's remarks. He obviously contemplates exactly the sort of problem that concerns me—that of multi-functioned authorisation. Despite the provisions of clause 10(3), one assumes that there will be many instances—it will be inevitable in many cases—of individual bodies and institutions seeking membership of a range of SROs, each of which will have slightly messy interfaces, to conduct a range of authorised investment business. That produces the inevitability of a major conflict of interests and, rather than our relying on the yet undisclosed rules of the SROs to deal with it, there should be a provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proper anxiety about an undue rigidity involving immediate recourse to the criminal law must, to some degree, surely be alleviated by the very proper intervention of the hon. Member for Yeovil. The amendment does not impose a mandatory requirement; it simply enables the designated agency, or the Secretary of State, to say in a given case, " This enterprise is clearly in the business of investment management and as a matter of general principle, unless we are shown special circumstances to the contrary, we would not normally authorise such an undertaking to deal in a similar range of investments." I suggest that the Minister should think of taking such a power in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for considering the problem; I do not think that there is much between us. In the light of my further remarks, the Minister may wish to add to what he has said, but the proper outcome to our short debate might be for me to withdraw the amendment, look at the 	<i>Hansard</i> report and return to the subject later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the argument of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), I think that there is rather more between the Minister and himself than he has suggested. After all, if one were to interpose the criminal law at the point at which the hon. Gentleman suggested, one would be locked into a range of investigations and prosecutions when the object of the exercise is, in a self-regulating body, that people should say, " If you don't behave yourself and if you become involved with a conflict of interests or in breaching Chinese walls, you should be hoofed out." If the man is hoofed out, the question whether he is thereafter acting without authorisation comes into play. The criminal law then comes in if the person does not act without due authority.

So, by investigating the provision, this amendment is challenging the root and essence of the Bill, which is the manner in which self-regulation operates. I prefer to stand by what the Bill says than what the hon: Gentleman has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) I feel that I must intervene, because he has touched absolutely on the centre of the problem. The amendment shows a difference in approach, which is much wider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
than the rather narrower difference about how something is put into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I made on Second Reading was that while we accept completely the importance of self-regulation within a statutory framework, the crux of the matter is at what point the balance between practitioner regulation and transaction regulation is struck. The amendment is aimed exactly at that point. There is no point in suggesting that if the amendment were accepted the concept of self-regulation or practitioner regulation would go out of the window; it would not. The balance would merely have shifted by a rather small amount in a direction which I personally find comforting—I make no bones about that. The present balance that has been struck by the Government in the Bill is inadequate, but that does not mean that the Bill is inadequate for the task that it sets itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see much more of a statutory framework. That is why I support the amendment. It is not a blanket amendment; it is up to the Minister to decide how he wishes to apply it. If the Minister wishes—as he clearly does—all the practitioner regulation to continue, he need not use the power that the amendment gives him. The amendment does not alter the balance in any way: that balance remains in the Minister's hands. It merely provides him with a reserve power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a reserve power is already built into clauses 59 and 60. However, the power in the amendment is more flexible and more precisely targeted, and can be used more appropriately to limit certain key practices which the Bill is in danger of neglecting. How will the Bill cope with the problem of cross-interests, for example? People in the City, who may take the same general view as the Minister, are now expressing considerable anxiety about whether the Chinese walls will be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has nothing to fear from the amendment. Admittedly, it brings in the criminal law in a way that he may find inelegant from a purely legalistic point of view. However, the Bill in any case provides for a mixture of criminal and civil penalties. The amendment need not apply except where the Minister wishes it to. It is not some great step that cannot be undone later. The powers will rest in his own hands, and if he does not wish to apply them he need not encounter any of the bad effects that he mentioned. But events have moved to a point at which he feels the need of extra powers, they will be in the Bill and he will be able to apply them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unpersuaded by the arguments of the Minister and the- hon. Member "for Stafford. I do not see why the amendment should not be accepted, as its- final application is in the Minister's hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The ' hon. Member for Stafford (Mr.' Cash) rightly pointed 'out—as did the' Minister —that under the Bill a member of a self-regulating organisation, although he would presumably com ply with the rules for a while, would eventually be " hoofed out" if he broke the rules.

Two points can be made. First, while the Bill is designed to protect investors, they may nevertheless suffer substantial losses if someone breaks the rules and is hoofed out. Secondly—this is the more important point, and one with which I think the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) will agree— it is not that we are anxious to introduce the criminal law at every turn. Rather than bringing in the criminal law ex post facto, we wish it to be there as the sanction for a power that the Secretary of State can use at the outset—before people get hoofed in, as it were. Before they are empowered or authorised to conduct certain sorts of investment business, it should be made clear to them that because they are conducting one sort of investment business they should not in principle conduct another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no increased danger of frequent use of the criminal law. The amendment merely makes the structure of authorisation a little clearer, and gives the Minister a power which I think that he would welcome in principle—the power to make the distinction between one function and another. Conservative Members' fears are groundless. Whichever structure is adopted, the criminal law will be there at the bottom to provide the sanction when necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not really wish the criminal law to be at the bottom; he wishes it to be in the middle. That, I think, is where the problem lies. What the hon. Gentleman has said is wholly impracticable. The amendment would give a discretionary power to Ministers to decide whether a criminal law sanction should be imposed, which would be entirely improper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition parties are hungry and eager to introduce the criminal law and a much tighter framework of regulation. The attitude expressed this morning derives from their disappointment that the Government's approach has not been to create a regulatory system which derives its powers in detail from legislation. Instead, the approach has been to set out principles and objectives enshrined in the statute, but to allow a fair measure of discretion in their application by the designated agency, so that we can have an up-to-date and accurately targeted regulatory system. I therefore share the strong preference of my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for minimising the part that the criminal law may play in the interests of achieving effective practitioner-based regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from that—I am pursuing here very much the same objective as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)—that it is important that an adequate range of sanctions should be available to self-regulating organisations to enable them to apply the necessary disciplines. If I have a criticism of the proposals in that respect, it is that the agency would perhaps not have a satisfactory range of sanctions. It its authority is to be credible, it is important that it should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One necessary sanction appears to be denied to the SROs. In the middle range, between the dra-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
conian penalty of the withdrawal of an organisation and the far from negligible sanction of public reprimand, my hon. and learned Friend proposes to include a power to require disgorgement and restitution of clients' money improperly handled. But that appears to be all. There doese not seem to be provision for the agency to impose fines, but I am puzzled by that omission. Some of the prospective self-regulating organisations intend to include fines among the sanctions which their members would have to agree to accept. I do not understand why the Government are reluctant to give the agency that power, as it is a necessary, practical and eminently fitting addition to the panopoly of sanctions of the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend could explain why that is omitted. It may be regarded as inappropriate or impractical on constitutional or legal grounds, but it would be helpful if a power on the part of the SIB or the designated agency to impose fines on backsliding or defaulting authorised institutions were added to the range of penalties envisaged. That would help to meet the anxieties expressed by the hon. Members for Dagenham and for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and which I appreciate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene yet again, but I found the later remarks of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) very interesting. Perhaps it would be useful for him to table an appropriate amendment. The problem is to get at the powers exercised by the self-regulating organisations, without a sub-delegation of powers, which might be awkward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that Opposition Members are, in broad terms, satisfied with the Bill's structure. We are not especially anxious to beef up the statutory powers. There will be instances where we would like to see amendments made and, certainly, there will be a major issue where we look to the identity of the body at the apex of the pyramid. But, in broad terms, we do not seek to criminalise at every opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). He is wrong to suggest that the implementation of this type of amendment would make the commission of a criminal offence dependent on some uncertainty. The effect of the proposal would be that the Secretary of State or designated agency would make the decision. It would be a perfectly clear decision, " You are or you are not authorised to carry out this or that sort of investment business." In any case, there would be some uncertainty about the margins between one sort of investment business and another. Once the decision is made, the question whether a person complies with it is a simple matter for the criminal law to decide in the normal way. The hon. Gentlemen's objection on that ground is not well founded, but perhaps the Minister can now set our minds at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
