	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government amendment No. 274 is a transitional provision, arising out of new clause 5. I shall, therefore, describe the new clause first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Insurance Brokers Registration Council was set up under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. The principal provision of the Act is to make it an offence for a person to call himself an insurance broker unless he is registered with the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Those registered with the council are subject to its code of conduct, and breach of the code leads to disciplinary action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act applies to all insurance broking, that is, to both long-term insurance as an investment and to general insurance, such as motor insurance and insurance of the contents of a house. The Bill will introduce a new regime for the regulation of the broking of long-term insurance as an investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental purpose of new clause 5 is to prevent undesirable dual regulation of the broking of long-term investment insurance, that is, to prevent regulation by both the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and by a self-regulating organisation in the area or by direct authorisation under the Bill. Accordingly, the principal provision of the new clause is to restrict the scope of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 to non-investment business, that is, to mainly general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>939</span>
insurance. That will leave room for the new system of regulation for investment insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IBRC will continue uniquely to be able to confer the privilege of using the term "insurance broker". In addition—and I return to Government amendment No. 274 to the schedule of transitional provisions—existing brokers who do only investment business will be able to remain on the register and to continue calling themselves insurance brokers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IBRC has expressed some worry about the new clause, and it is reflected in the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). I am grateful to him for raising the issue of whether the IBRC should continue to regulate life insurance broked by its members as well as general business. The question is complex, and there is no single answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the worry that the IBRC has expressed about the exclusion of life business from the scope of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act and I should be happy to consider further what alternative approach we could devise to meet those worries. It is complex, and we should all hesitate at the prospect of life insurance intermediaries being subject to two systems of regulation, one under the Bill and one under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act. Therefore, one needs to ensure that, in meeting the worries of the IBRC, any possible conflict between the two systems and any needless duplication is avoided. On the other hand, if businesses that arrange only life insurance are to be able to join the IBRC and call themselves insurance brokers, one will have to see that that right of access is fair and reasonable, and that it will not call into question the authorisation of businesses under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall carefully consider what alternative course we can pursue to meet the worry of the IBRC and shall consult it and other interested parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Minister's object of ensuring that the supervision that will apply to insurance intermediaries under the Bill will not conflict with the requirements of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. The statutory rules of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council will have to be amended to take account of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main worry is that the Minister's amendment would in some circumstances deprive insurance intermediaries of their existing right to call themselves insurance brokers. I doubt whether the consequences of that would be helpul to members of the public in meeting some of their investment needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people readily relate to insurance and its uses, and the holder of the title "insurance broker" is recognised as a source of advice on matters of insurance, including insurance contracts which will henceforward be described as investments. Whatever is decided, those contracts will remain insurance policies in the mind of the general public. There seems to be no good reason why anyone should be denied the free choice to call himself an insurance broker when setting himself up as an insurance intermediary, simply because of an artificial barrier of timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will be persuaded that the broader scheme envisaged under the Bill will not be undermined if we allow those who specialise in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>940</span>
particular area of investment work to make that fact clear to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market for professional indemnity insurance has changed substantially since 1979 when the existing rules were made. Secton 12(1) of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 requires the rules to deal with
	<br><q><p>"any description of civil liability".</p></q>
As the section is worded, the Insurance Brokers Registration Council believes that it would not be within its powers to change its rules to provide for less protection. I propose in amendment (f) that "shall" be changed to "may" in that section. The existing rules could be revoked putting alternatives in their place. The council is already committed to utilising to the full any insurance facilities that continue to exist and to supplement them with other arrangements to protect the public in their dealings with insurance brokers. The council understands that the British Insurance Brokers' Association agrees with the principles of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should make it clear that it is no longer my intention to press amendment (a). That is because I now believe that the purpose of the amendment will be better accomplished and better debated on new clause 7. I am worried about the effect of the new clause and the Minister's amendments on the IBRC. I was involved in the evolution of the IBRC and was in part responsible for the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977, under which the council became a vehicle for voluntary registration to enable it to use the title "broker". I am sad that by making the amendments we could risk reducing the influence of the Insurance Brokers' Registation Council. The Government could also be accused of ingratitude, because the IBRC has been the only self-regulating organisation within the area of insurance intermediaries. It has kept high the standards which enable people to call themselves "broker". It has had as part of its requirement for that the provision of professional indemnity insurance. It has done much to extend consumer protection to the purchaser of both life and non-life business in a period when no alternative was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the changes proposed to the IBRC could reduce, either wittingly or unwittingly, the standing of the IBRC. It seems to me that those registered with the IBRC on the appointed day will stay registered, but those who are not registered, and who are solely life and investment brokers, will be unable to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a composite broker dealing in both life and general will be able to register, even if he is just starting. But a life and investment broker, not currently registered, will not be able to do so. That is a pity because the word "broker" conveys, to some members of the public at least—I do not wish to exaggerate it—a feeling of probity and competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that a life and investment intermediary, having been required to register under either an SRO or the SIB, would be unable—should he so choose because of the standing of the title "broker"—to apply for registration under the new clauses. To deny future investment brokers the opportunity to take that step if they wish to do so, would be to reduce the importance of registration and, thus, the standing of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>941</span>
I fear that some will consider approval of their life and investment companies—for which they will be required to register under the Bill—a sufficient accolade. They may not consider pursuing registration, or, worse still, may decide to deregister because the value of registration will have been reduced by the new clauses and amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to oppose the new clauses because I recognise that changes to the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act are essential. However, will my hon. and learned Friend the Minister consider whether the status, standing, reputation and importance of the IBRC will be brought into question as a result of the changes in the Bill? Is he satisfied that the title "broker" is of so little consequence that intermediaries who wish to continue to use it should be deprived of that opportunity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am accused of suggesting that intermediaries should be encouraged to wear a belt and braces, so be it. However, "broker" is the only title that suggests competence and probity to the public. That title has been built up to its present level of acceptance over many years. I question whether casting it aside lightly is the right way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, I support the sentiments of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). We should welcome the idea of strengthening and realising the notion of the registration of brokers. Anything that happened during the passage of the Bill which weakened that system would be regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If life brokers were required to be authorised, there would be a danger that less respectable practitioners might gravitate towards the general end of the business where the requirements are perhaps not so stringent. Moreover, as the hon. Gentleman said, if life brokers are required to be authorised they might regard authorisation as an adequate certificate of respectability and not feel obliged to register with the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Then the structure of registration, so painfully built up on a voluntary basis, would crumble. Neither the Minister nor anyone else would regard that as a desirable outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Bill the right vehicle to bring about a slightly tougher regime that will encourage rather than discourage people to register? Here I part company with the hon. Gentleman on a matter of principle. I am not convinced that the Bill should go wider than the ambit of investment business. If we go beyond that limitation we enter the real of all sorts of consumer purchases which would not be appropriately regulated under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said, at least not yet—new clause 7 has still to be debated—what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is implying that I said. It is flattering that hon. Gentleman should anticipate my every word. He may know what I am about to say but I am not sure that I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot dodge the fact that the Bill refers to the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. That is what the new clause is all about. We should forget the extension of the Bill into fire, motor
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>942</span>
and general insurance and devote ourselves to examining the operation of the Act, which will remain in existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great regard for the hon. Gentleman, but he is being a little egocentric. He must not regard my every word as being in anticipation of remarks that he may or may not make. On this occasion I was speaking for myself. I adverted to the possibility, which may find form in his new clause 7 which we shall debate later, that some people may consider the Bill the appropriate vehicle for strengthening the system of registering brokers in general insurance. My view is that the Bill is not an appropriate instrument because it would take us too far beyond the confines of investment business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman therefore argue at such length that Lloyd's should be incorporate in the Bill simply to make a political point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely disappointed in the hon. Gentleman. The nub and crux of our lengthy and useful debate on Lloyd's was whether the investment business of Lloyd's should, on normal principles, be brought within the Bill, as it would have been but for the particular and specific exclusion in clause 40.1 am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not yet grasped that point. We are talking about general insurance, which goes well beyond the concept of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made long and careful preparation in legislating in this area, even though that work has not always produced the right outcome. It would be wrong at this late stage suddenly to slip in by a side wind a provision affecting a quite different area. I am not convinced that we should try to secure by these means what I agree is a laudable objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of some comfort to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar to know that my difficulties with using the Bill to achieve his objectives are compounded by the fact that, as we all know, the issue is not the subject of consensus in the industry so far. Various bits of the industry contest the desirability of doing what the hon. Gentleman wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view would be changed if I thought that there was a possibility of a consensus. If the industry could say to the Minister, "We have agreed, albeit painfully, that some amendment to the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 to strengthen the requirement for registration should be achieved in such-and-such a way or in such-and-such an area," it might change the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth referring to the letter which I imagine many members of the Committee received from the Association of British Insurers. The association rather reluctantly conceded that it would not object to an amendment that would bring all full-time independent general insurance intermediaries under the Act. If that is to be taken at its face value, perhaps we should abandon our conceptual difficulties over the Bill and take the opportunity of securing a worthwhile objective. I think that many Committee members would regard that as something worth achieving if it could be done with the general consent of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister suddenly to accede to the amendments or new clauses on the subject, but I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>943</span>
hope that he will recognise his responsibility to try to promote such a consensus, were it possible. I hope that the Minister will tell us of any conversations that he has had with the British Insurance Brokers Association or with the ABI to see whether it is possible for the Bill to be used later to secure reform and prevent any deterioration in present arrangements, which most hon. Members would appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not suggest that Opposition Members will fully support amendment (a) or the later new clause 7,1 hope that, with that degree of support, the Minister will show that he is prepared to recognise his responsibility for trying to produce a solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This short debate has served many useful purposes, not the least of which is to heighten the keen sense of anticipation that we all have for the debate on new clause 7. I hope that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will forgive me if I save my replies to his points until that debate, where they would be more relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown that I am sensitive to concerns expressed about the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. It is in the context of those concerns that I have shown my sympathy with the amendment to new clause 5 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 2 is clear. Clause 156 already creates an offence of holding oneself out to be authorised under the Bill without having the authorisation. We are seeking to square the circle, and to accustom members of the public to deal only with authorised persons, and to look for evidence of authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 requires those who are authorised to state the fact prominently on their literature and their notepaper. In order to ensure that the duty is complied with, the new clause creates an offence of failing to make such a disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will see this as a useful corollary to the rules already in place and as a means of encouragement both to those who are authorised and to the clients of investment business to deal exclusively with each other and not to be sidetracked by those outside the ambit of the Act as it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If new clause 2 were in place we could reasonably expect clients to look for some indication that they were dealing with authorised persons. That could only improve investor protection and the general awareness of what authorisation under the Act will mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a way of satisfying the intention of the new clause, but, as has happened so often during our proceedings, the Government feel that there is a better method of achieving its objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I certainly agree that it is desirable to require authorised persons to state on their letter headings and sales literature that they are authorised, I think that it would be a serious overreaction to make it a criminal offence. The Bill rightly makes it a criminal offence falsely to claim to be authorised. The mischief caused by a failure to disclose authorisation is less serious. As hon. Members know, the rules which may be made under clause 45 may regulate, I quote from subsection 45(2)(c):
	<br><q><p>"the manner in which a person may hold himself out as carrying on investment business".</p></q>
Furthermore, subsection (2)(e) provides that rules made under clause 45 make provision
	<br><q><p>"as to the form and content of advertisements in respect of investment business".</p></q>
Also, rules made under clause 45 may make different provision for different cases. This provides valuable flexibility, which the proposed new clause would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any failure by an authorised person to comply with a conduct of business rule would be a matter which a designated agency might take into account in determining whether authorisation should be withdrawn or suspended. Similarly, recognised self-regulating organisations and recognised professional bodies would be required to maintain and enforce rules which afford investors protection at least equivalent to that provided by the designated agency's rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I believe that the existing provisions of the Bill provide fully for rules which have the effect which Opposition Members are seeking. I can furthermore offer them information I have received about the plans of the Securities and Investments Board to make rules in this area. As hon. Members know, SIB is publishing its draft conduct of business rules in stages. It is currently working on rules which would indeed require authorised persons to indicate the fact of their authorisation in their communications with investors. It is considering not only the written literature covered by the new clause, but messages displayed on television screen monitors used in dealing rooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will welcome those intentions. I hope that Opposition Members will consider that the import of what they require will be satisfied by that methodology and that the hon. Gentleman may wish to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister's specific assurance that the conduct of business rules will cover the point, I would not insist that the new clause be pressed to a Division.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>946</span>

	<p>"The auditors of an authorised person, if they are satisfied that it is expedient to do so in order to protect investors, shall be entitled, notwithstanding any obligation of confidence incumbent on them, to send information to—
	<ol>
	<li>the designated agency in cases where the authorised person carries on business by virtue of an authorisation granted directly by the designated agency; or</li>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. Clause 76(8) of the Building Societies Bill contains the same wording as this new clause. What is good for the building societies is good for financial service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the wording in line 2, can the hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that he was sober when he tabled the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about when I tabled it, but I hope that I am sober now that I have the chance to move it. I do not have the advantage of having a colleague, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) had, who could nip in and out of the Committee considering the Building Societies Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can learn from what is contained in the Building Societies Bill. The matters that are likely to be of interest to the Securities and Investments Board or the relevant SRO are even more likely to come to the attention of
	<br><q><p>"the auditors of an authorised person"</p></q>
than matters that may be of interest or concern to the Building Societies Commission may come to the attention of an auditor of a building society. The scope for malpractice is much greater in investment transactions than it is within building society activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the Standing Committee considering the Building Societies Bill agreed to the clause without debate; the principle involved was not discussed. The only question raised was whether the auditors needed more legal immunity than the Building Societies Bill bestowed on them. So that is an interesting precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would ensure that auditors of an authorised person would have at least once a year a more accurate and detailed picture of the state of affairs within the companies that they are auditing than any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>947</span>
supervisor could hope to have. That would give them a useful insight into the financial position of those businesses, although one would hope that the supervisors would monitor the financial health of all authorised persons closely, as well as the chance to examine the honesty and competence of the authorised persons. It may also give a unique insight because of the auditors' relationship with the company and the questions that they can ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the case for giving auditors at least the right to communicate with the SIB or the SROs is generally accepted, but the question remains whether the new clause should go further and impose a duty on the auditors. That has several attractions, but if we went as far as that, we should raise fundamental questions about the relationship of auditors with the companies that they audit and that might create more difficulties than it would solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) has raised an important issue with his new clause, and I support its approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This question was raised recently in connection with banks and the review of banking supervision that the Government have undertaken. As my hon. Friend said, his new clause is based on the equivalent provision in the Building Societies Bill, and it is important that we establish a common approach to the different financial institutions because in the next Session, we shall have a banking Bill. I am sure that the Department of Trade and Industry has been working with the Treasury and the Bank of England to ensure that we have a common approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to read in paragraph 4.3 of the consultative document published at the end of last year that the Department does not expect auditors
	<br><q><p>"to carry a major part of the regulatory burden."</p></q>
It is important to appreciate the primary responsibility of auditors to their client—the shareholders, in the case of a company—to report on the stewardship of the business by the directors. The Department's recommendation is summed up in a sentence in paragraph 4.4, which states that auditors
	<br><q><p>"would be required, in performing their functions, to have regard to the need to keep supervisors informed of matters of which the supervisors need to be aware in order properly to perform their functions."</p></q>
That was refined in the response of the Securities and Investments Board to the consultative document. The board pointed out that the Bill does not require an authorised investment business to have an audit—only limited liability companies would have to have one— and it requested a provision to require all authorised investment businesses to appoint an auditor. If the board believes that that should be in the Bill, I suspect that there is some merit in it—although it may be a matter for the conduct of business rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the relationship between the auditor and the supervisor, the board recognised
	<br><q><p>"that the auditor cannot be expected to fulfil the role of- Supervisor and therefore cannot be required to report on all circumstances that might fall under a 	<i>general</i> heading of 'matters likely to put the interests of investors at risk'."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>948</span>
The board went on to enumerate in its paper five different matters on which it thought it would be appropriate for the auditor to have a duty to report to the supervisor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of my institute—the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales—is that "the preferable approach", which is the one in the new clause, would be:
	<br><q><p>"to establish a clear right of access to the supervisor"—</p></q>
that is, a right rather than a duty;
	<br><q><p>"to provide protection from actions for damages as a result of communications between auditors and supervisors"—</p></q>
a matter that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) in the Building Societies Bill Standing Committee; and
	<br><q><p>"to produce guidance for auditors as to the occasions on which they should consider using their rights of access."</p></q>
The difficulty of pursuing the idea of a duty is that clearly it would be necessary—unless it was to be all-embracing—to enumerate the circumstances in which there was a duty, but that may exclude circumstances which would be appropriate. Therefore, the more sensible way to proceed may be along the lines of the new clause, with guidance to be given by the bodies concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That approach was adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, who stated:
	<br><q><p>"What is important to the auditor playing a more active role in the financial services sector is that he should have, and be seen to have, the 	<i>statutory right</i> to communicate directly with the supervisors. His professional guidance should then detail the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the auditor to breach his normal duty of confidentiality in client affairs and to communicate directly with the appropriate regulatory authority."</p></q>
That is the story so far. The consultative period for the document has finished and I was informed in a recent parliamentary answer that all the responses were being considered. I would be helpful if we could be told whether the Government will bring forward proposals, perhaps on Report, to deal with those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said, the new clause deals with whether auditors should have a duty or a right. I support the new clause as an approach to the matter, but I wait to hear the Minister's comments, as the Government might bring forward proposals that will substantially cover the point. The approach suggesting that there should be a right of access, rather than a duty, is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must ask whether installing that right means that people will take it up, whether there will be a sufficiently strong action and whether merely placing it as a right in legislation will encourage more adequate practice in such matters. Many people believe that merely to install that right will not necessarily mean that any further action will be taken. I dissent from that view because, if the right is there, there will inevitably be pressure upon those involved to make use of it wherever possible. That is important, and it will, therefore, encourage auditors to use the right. The measure will produce a tendency in the right direction. It might have to be strengthened later, but it is a better way of going about the problem than to install a duty. I concur with the remarks of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>949</span>
I also support the measure because, if we make it a duty on auditors to report matters inimical to the investor's best interests, they will inevitably seek—to use a naval expression—to clear their yard-arm; in other words, to report as often as possible and, therefore, to play safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rob Hayward 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not as good as legal language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I am the significant minority of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a duty, there will be a tendency to play safe and report all sorts of matters, which might be trivial, but which people think that they should report because a sanction might be exercised against them if they do not perform their duty. That would be bad for auditors and would produce all sorts of information which need not be produced and might consequently damage companies' reputations. If any approach has to be encompassed in the Bill, I should prefer this one, but I await with interest the Minister's comments about the Government's proposals. These proposals might not be appropriate, if the Government intend to bring forward their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am especially grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) for raising this matter, and I listened with interest to his comments. He referred to the interlocking between the various parts of legislation currently going through Parliament. On occasions, I have wondered whether it would be better to have one Bill in which we dealt with all three matters under separate chapters—namely, financial ser vices, building societies and banking—because they all interlock. However, I am not sure whether I could put up with the interventions of my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just going to ask whether my hon. Friend has no home to go to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I dealt with my hon. Friend's intervention before he made it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). We must ask ourselves what is an auditor. In a nutshell, an auditor is qualified to perform specific functions, under section 485 of the Companies Act 1985, in relation to company audit. That has little to do with giving advice about who is an authorised person, and the ramifications of the Bill. I wonder, therefore, whether it is appropriate for auditors to be given these specific functions and whether the persons who are to be regarded under the Companies Act as those qualified to do the job, which as my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) says, need to be done, are necessarily the right person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, the passing of information could be construed as yet a further extension of the activities of auditors into areas where they are not necessarily competent to provide the kind of advice that they are otherwise qualified to provide. A similar question arises over the definition of auditors for the purposes of recognised professional bodies, under clause 18 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have made my point, and I should be grateful if the Minister would give this matter some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>950</span>
thought. There are others who can give financial advice, who are also accountants or other financial advisers, but are not necessarily confined, in terms of competence, to company audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that, as before, my hon. and learned Friend will keep an open mind on who should, or should not, be given the responsibility of determining who is, or should be, entitled to investigate the activities of authorised persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred to his institute; I should not for one moment wish to derogate from his argument on that point, but perhaps I should add that my great-grandfather was one of the founding members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 4 is very important. I do not agree with the view that giving the information should be a right of auditors; I believe that it should be a duty. We are perhaps starting out from the wrong position. As we have to accept that most of the investors and companies that will be involved in the Bill are honest, so equally we have to accept that most of the people who work in the professions—whether as auditors or solicitors or anyone else—are basically honest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we cannot assume that all auditors or all solicitors are honest, and we must look at the way in which the City is developing. I believe that we are in danger of creating a new middle-class criminal in Britain. He may call himself a consultant, or an auditor or a solicitor, and he or she may, or may not, be qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fraud is becoming a complex business, and I think that it could not take place without the help of auditors and solicitors. I once asked eight solicitors what they would do if they were asked to draw up a document which was, in itself, perfectly lawful, but which was designed to hide the nature of another transaction—for that is the way that fraud operates. All the solicitors said, without question, that they would draw the document up, because that was their job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that people who want to commit fraud in Britain will surround themselves with bevies of accountants, solicitors and consultants and will be helped, in the commission of that fraud, by those people. That is what makes it important to make this a duty and not a right for the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot go into this as it relates to the banking system—and particularly to Johnson Matthey Bankers—because I believe that there is a legal case outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have gone through the papers in the PCW case and one or two of the other Lloyd's cases, and I believe that those crimes could not have been committed without the knowledge of the auditors. I do not think that they were simply turning a blind eye. The notion of confidentiality between client and professional is getting in the way of dealing with fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to Exeter university to talk to the law school, and I had explained to me some of the interlocking relationships between the broking and underwriting firms and the auditors in the PCW case. That was terrifying, and had there been a duty on the auditors
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>951</span>
in that case to report the suspicion of fraud I do not believe that the fraud would have got off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditors almost certainly knew what was going on, and indeed, played a role. It is, therefore, important that we ask all the professions, the auditors and solicitors and other consultants, to look at the way in which they operate, and we shall then have to place new duties on all the professions. The Bill may not be the right place to do so, as this is a major issue, but I hope that the Government will come forward with more solid, constructive and detailed proposals than those in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an entirely different concern from that of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). Auditors already have a duty to report anything criminal. The new clause would extend auditors' responsibilities by imposing on them what amounts to a deemed duty to make value judgments. The new clause is permissive and I applaud the sentiments behind it, but I am not sure that it will remain permissive. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) said that there would be a deemed obligation to report almost everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Auditors already have a duty to report anything criminal, which meets the concern of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch. The new clause would impose on auditors a new and novel obligation to make a value judgment about what may affect investors. I am a little worried by the clause and I am surprised that hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), whose professional judgment I value greatly, finds it acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can respond briefly. My hon. Friend has touched on the important fact that a right could be deemed to be an implied duty. There is a danger that supervisors might be inundated with a plethora of useless information, but if the matter were dealt with in the way that I suggested guidance could be given and the circumstances in which it was appropriate to draw the supervisors' attention to certain matters could be restricted or confined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is worried about supervisors being inundated, but surely the real problem is the fact that firms' reputations could be needlessly damaged. That is a far more important aspect. If an auditor has a duty or is subject to too much pressure, he may, as a sort of insurance policy, express concerns that are no more than the vaguest suggestions in his mind and for which there is no particular substance, and bringing them into the public or semi-public arena could damage the firms involved unnecessarily. That is a far greater danger than the risk of swamping supervisors with trivial suspicions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any of this information would be published. It would be communicated to the supervisor, but even so it could be actionable in libel. That is why I said that auditors would want to secure some kind of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) has identified an important aspect, but the accountancy professional rightly feels that there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>952</span>
a certain amount of public interest and that the auditor has a wider duty. His duty is not just to his client. That has always been the case. My hon. Friend said that in certain circumstances professional guidance already makes it clear that an auditor must report suspected criminal acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a wider aspect, although it is not clear how much wider. The Department wanted a general duty in the consultative document. The board has tried to refine the duty by listing five matters but even that approach is difficult. I prefer the solution based on a right, but I accept the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West that even that approach is not without difficulty. The issues need to be thought through carefully before we impose on auditors what could in practice be onerous duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When this morning my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) complained about the excessive role of lawyers in the prosecution process I was tempted to suggest that their role was analogous to that of accountants in the auditing process. But I resisted that temptation in the interests of promoting good will.

I should like to respond to the many invitations from all parts of the Committee to report on some of the preliminary conclusions emerging from the response to the consultative document on the auditor's role in the financial services sector. I will have taken into account the points I do not specifically mention, as this is a continuing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twenty-nine responses from the accountancy bodies, firms and individuals have been received. I am hopeful that arrangements will be found which will commend themselves to the auditing profession and will provide for a constructive relationship between auditor and supervisor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My objective is to facilitate communication between auditors and supervisors. I want to see arrangements in place which will encourage a constructive relationship between the business, the auditor and the supervisor. I believe that the auditor can play a positive role in the proper working of the supervisory system. I think that everyone who has spoken shares this objective. So, if I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) to withdraw his clause, it is not because of a great issue of principle, but because we are still coming to conclusions, following our consultation and I should like to bring forward a package covering all aspects of this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has hit on a key issue—that of the need for auditors to be released from the duty of confidentiality to their client so that they can give information to a supervisor. He will have noticed that the consultative document suggests that any duty of confidentiality does not under the existing law prevent disclosure to the appropriate authorities if there is a public interest in that disclosure—as when the interests of investors are at stake. I am obviously looking at this point with special care, in the light of the profession's comments on the consultative document. It may well be that some specific release from confidentiality is helpful to the auditor, if he is to report on matters which may not be automatically regarded as "in the public interest". The Building Societies Bill takes that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>953</span>
view and I shall be considering the matter very carefully. I am doubtful whether the provision in that Bill is strictly necessary, having regard to the present state of the law. I shall be considering that closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend accept that my point about auditors' qualifications not necessarily being exclusively pertinent to the function proposed under the new clause means that there is a case for the function not necessarily being confined to auditors alone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about that point, but I shall reflect on it as I do on all points made by Committee members.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was far too diffident to make any point of the kind made by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can now say a few words about how my thinking about the scope of the auditor's package is developing. Sir Kenneth Berrill has made it clear that supervisors are to supervise and auditors to audit. I certainly accept that supervision should remain the responsibility of the supervisor. No attempt to pass the regulatory buck from the supervisor to the auditor will be made. I recognise that the auditor is not continually examining a business's affairs and is not in a position to remedy any deficiencies in the supervisory system. It is also vital that the relationship between business and auditor be not undermined, so that a business feels unable to trust its auditor. No one, least of all the supervisor, will benefit from such a breakdown in trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also sensitive to the profession's fears that, if a wide-ranging and imprecisely drafted general statutory duty to give information to a supervisor is imposed on an auditor, the profession will be tempted to swamp the supervisor with information, simply to cover itself against allegations of a failure to report. But the experience of the stock exchange, whose arrangements for communication between auditors and the exchange have worked well, shows that it is possible to surmount those difficulties. It also shows the supervisory system works better as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditor can play a useful and supportive role, and I am heartened that much of the profession appears to agree. In particular, it appears to be accepted that auditors have a right to speak directly to supervisors in some circumstances, but that those circumstances should be carefully defined. That is an important safeguard. Areas of agreement are emerging. There are few problems in requiring the auditor, acting as a reporting accountant, to comment on returns made to the supervisor by a business. There also seems to be broad agreement that there are some circumstances which the auditor should draw to the supervisor's attention— normally after telling the client, but, in exceptional circumstances, without doing so, especially when fraud is suspected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>954</span>
But there are some less clear-cut circumstances, where it is not yet agreed whether an auditor should report to a supervisor, for example, when the financial position of an investment business deteriorates. The problems of defining those areas are considerable, for example, at what point does deterioration become sufficiently serious to justify a report—too narrow a definition satisfies the auditor, but does not give the supervisor what is needed; too broad a definition may place the auditor in an impossible position and make the arrangement unworkable. However, we are making progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our discussions will enable us to define the relationship between auditor and supervisor in a way that will commend itself to much of the profession and to the financial services supervisors. I shall consider how best it can be put into practice and what statutory provision is necessary. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South will accept that, in those circumstances, it would be inappropriate for him to press his clause. I am confident that we are working to the same end, but more work remains to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose and effect of new clause 7 will be clear to all Committee members. In essence, it seeks to extend protection to the consumer in the field of non-life insurance. The method recommended in the amendment is to require all intermediaries dealing with general insurance business—that is, non-life and investment—to come under the control of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977, and to conform to standards laid down in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear to the Committee that I do not contend that that is necessarily the only way to achieve my broad objective, but it will not have escaped the attention of Committee members that the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 is already being amended in the Bill. It appeared, therefore, to be an appropriate vehicle on which to base the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two brief points in support of my proposition. Few Committee members underestimate the importance of being properly insured, whether we are speaking of a life assurance policy, an investment policy or cover on a motor car or a household. Given that most policies will be sold to members of the public through an intermediary, it is essential that control is exercised over the intermediaries selling non-life business, just as, in the Bill, we are seeking to exercise control over them in the sale of life and investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My association with the British Insurance Brokers Association is well-known, as I have declared my interest to the Committee on several occasions. That association has mounted a public-spirited campaign to try to extend the range of consumer protection in respect of the purchase of insurance business. As we recognise that some matters are being forced upon intermediaries as a result of the Bill—that is not a complaint—it would be easy to leave well alone, and to recognise that sometime we may have an opportunity to legislate and move into the field of non-life assurance. That would be an understandable state of affairs. I hope that the Committee will concede that, in bringing forward the proposal, the members of BIBA are effectively offering to comply with higher standards than the bill requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was fortified some time ago when I sought to attract the signatures of hon. Members in an early-day motion, calling for the extension of such consumer protection into motor, fire and househould insurances. I was heartened by the fact that 120 hon. members from all parties saw fit to sign that motion. I hope that it is difficult for Committee members to resist the case, if we are serious about consumer protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now turn my attention to objections that have been raised or may be rehearsed during the debate. First, we are told that to regulate all non-life intermediaries would be anti-competitive. How do those who argue that justify that the bill is seeking to do precisely that in relation to life and investment intermediaries? If it is anti-competitive to embrace intermediaries in general insurance, it must be anti-competitive in life and investment insurance. Either one argument stands up or neither of them stands up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>956</span>
Secondly, it is suggested that the result of the new clause would be more bureaucracy. I paid tribute to the experience and success of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council, and what I suggest would be no more than an expansion of the scale of activity of the registration council. I also question whether the argument that more bureaucracy will be created can be sustained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I am told that the additional cost to the little man, the intermediary, who perhaps has no more than one or two staff, will be prohibitive. In my estimation, the cost of doing what the new clause seeks to achieve would be comparatively small, but even if it were not, it has not proved to be a barrier in the sphere of the small intermediary selling only life and investment business. So why it should be thought to be crippling to extend it to non-life intermediaries I am at a loss to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, people ask whether I am suggesting that every motor dealer, every small accountant and every building society shot-Id have to register. I shall take that argument head-on. The answer is, yes, if we are serious about extending consumer protection to the purchaser of non-life business. But I am a realist. I recognise that although that is the import of the new clause, we may well have to be satisfied by recognising that some areas cause far greater concern than others. I am prepared to restrict the type of person to whom the new clause would extend to full-time insurance intermediaries, who at present masquerade under the titles of consultants or advisers, or the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me assume that I carry the Committee with me to this point. I am told that that is all very well but under the Bill non-life insurance is not an investment. I have no defence. I concede that it is not an investment within the terms of definition of the Bill. But those who take that line are duty bound to tell me that if that is not acceptable, or not the right vehicle, but nevertheless that there are strong arguments in favour of doing what I seek to achieve, how we achieve it. The Insurance Brokers Registration Council is the subject of amendments to the Bill, so why not an extension in the interests of consumer protection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it not be ironic if, after the Bill were enacted, the only area where consumer protection did not apply to insurance concerns was in general insurance? We have spent a long time in Committee trying to increase the standards of life assurance intermediaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar will forgive me, but before you depart from the room, as you are leaving our proceedings, I should not like that moment to pass without paying tribute to you and acknowledging with gratitude the most considerable and genial way in which you have presided over our lengthy proceedings. They could not have proceeded as smoothly and as amicably without the manner in which you have taken the Chair. We are all truly grateful to you, Sir Michael, and I should not have liked the moment to pass without expressing our gratitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As, by a happy coincidence, the moment of your departure coincides with a brief visit to the Committee by my predecessor, the hon. Member for Edinburgh,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I must take advantage of this opportunity as I, too, have to leave shortly. I had asked the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to associate me with such comments as I knew that he would make at the end of our proceedings, and it gives me great pleasure to associate myself with those comments now. It has been a pleasure to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship. It has also been instructive, as this is only my second Committee. For both those reasons I should like to express my thanks for your chairmanship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Our work has progressed in a way that is probably more constructive than that of any Committee that I have ever known. The Committee has set an example to the whole House of how Committees should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In raising the point of order, hon. Member have assisted my successor in that I shall be setting forth from my other occupations to return here at 10 o'clock. Having made these fulsome remarks, I suspect that the hon. Member for Maidstone (Sir J. Wells) would not wish to see me here again. He may find that that has helped to bring a termination in sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all hon. Members for their cooperation. It has been a pleasure to be Chairman of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always slightly disconcerting to be interrupted in mid flow, but I can think of no better reason for such an interruption than for a genuine and justified tribute to be paid to the former Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Till now I have not referred to the fact that there are two principal parties in the new clause. The insurance companies as principals would be deeply affected by the changes I am proposing. However, to their eternal credit, since 1977 the insurance companies have been at at the forefront of support for the aims and purposes of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Association of British Insurers in particular have encouraged intermediaries to follow the line of registration, and they have agreed with much of what we have discussed about controls in relation to life assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the companies have an objection to the new clause, it appears to be that they say that they are not aware
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>958</span>
of general insurance problems on an alarming scale. They say that they object because the IBRC would constitute a monopoly, but I must repeat that in such circumstances the appropriate SROs and the SIB would together constitute a monopoly on life and investment business. Until recently the insurance companies appear to have been opposed to the suggestion because they say that small intermediaries will be forced out of business. I do not want that to happen, but there is no sign that it will happen, nor is there concern among insurance companies that it might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The insurance companies said that they knew of no special problems with general insurance, but no more than 17 days ago on 8 March an article in 	<i>The Times</i> stated:
	<br><q><p>"It has emerged that more large insurance companies are involved in an insurance disaster".</p></q>
Later the article said
	<br><q><p>"An estimated statement of affairs of the company"—</p></q>
of intermediaries—
	<br><q><p>"passed to 	<i>The Times</i> this week, shows that at least six life offices are involved. It also reveals how the general insurers have themselves lost hundreds of thousands of pounds."</p></q>
With particular significance to the clause, the article continues:
	<br><q><p>"These significant losses, involving insurers who allowed the intermediary to act as their agent, highlight the inadequacy of the current systems for vetting the suitability of intermediaries and throw into question the current proposals for self-regulation of the life assurance sales industry.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Almost all the missing money was insurance premiums for general—non-life—policies which the insurers never received."</p></q>
Happily the insurers were prepared to stand by their clients after the agents had absconded with the money, but that is not always so. The case underlines the fact that it is possible for a personal tragedy to befall an individual or a small company when dealing with an intermediary in general insurance who is incompetent or fraudulent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lest anyone says, "But that's just a few days ago," I shall go back many years to another two examples. Some members of the Committee will remember that in the early 1970s the failure of the Fire, Auto and Marine and of the Vehicle and General insurance companies caused extreme hardship to thousands of policyholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of Insurance Companies Act 1974 was introduced to make the likelihood of such a debacle much more difficult in 1986. But the fact that many policies were sold by people who were allowed to call themselves brokers before the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 has never been underlined or remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have attended to the principle of consumer safety, but we have singularly failed to bring within the ambit of consumer protection the thousands of people adversely affected in 1974. If the new clause is rejected we shall continue to fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be told that insurance companies have then-own system of control. I pay tribute to the codes of conduct recently introduced, but they have not succeeded in matching the level of consumer protection in, for example, the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. The codes have been loosely enforced and in practice extend little protection to the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>959</span>
I echo the words of the hon. Member for Dagenham. When he anticipated my speech on the new clause he said that if there was no regulation for non-life business and quite tight controls over life business, the crooks who have always been in the midst of the insurance business—I say that with no pleasure—would gravitate towards high commission—paying general business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Committee really want to pass over an opportunity, albeit not the most ideal one, to bring the problem under control? It is not fair to expose the public in this way. The Government will miss a major opportunity if they do not accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I have outlined and the evidence that I have tried to adduce lead to the proposals in the new clause. However, I am a realist and recognise that it may not be possible to persuade colleagues on both sides of the Committee to go that far. In anticipation of the reply of my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and of my subsequent intervention, I shall say that I am wide open to alternative suggestions. I shall listen intently before I reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dichotomy of view between the insurance companies in the shape of the Association of British Insurers and the brokers in the shape of the BIBA has made it difficult to create one method to achieve my objective. However, in the last few days an opportunity beckons that may satisfy me and which may even be acceptable to my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee have received a copy of the ABI's letter dated 19 March 1986, which gives two means of solving the problem. First, the letter says that
	<br><q><p>"the insurance companies would not oppose the scope of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act being extended to cover all full-time independent general insurance intermediaries".</p></q>
If the motor agents, dentists, part-time accountants and building societies were removed from my new clause, it would not be very different from the ABI proposal. If I could persuade the Committee that that compromise was generally acceptable and that perhaps it should be introduced in another place, my efforts would not have been in vain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary could go only as far as the ABI's second suggestion I should be prepared to listen to his response. The ABI says:
	<br><q><p>"we suggest that any changes should emerge from a comprehensive review of the entire working of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act. We ourselves would like to see a number of changes made to the Rules made under it, and we believe that BIBA, and possibly others, may also have some suggestions in this area.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Such a review would enable all interested parties to be involved".</p></q>
That is the less acceptable suggestion but when the ABI and the BIBA begin to come together as we have been encouraging them to do for two years in an attempt to solve the problem without the need for legislation, my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is duty bound to pay a great deal of attention to the compromise suggested and I hope that he will respond in kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene, as I do not wish to make a speech. My hon. Friend has made a powerful case for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>960</span>
the regulation of general insurance, but I still feel that this would not be the appropriate place to include it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Minister could give us some commitment to an inquiry or review or extension of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 to include agents and consultants, I think that would be satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. Dependent upon the context within which such a response was forthcoming from the Minister, I should be prepared to consider that solution. However, I have to tell my hon. Friend, in advance, that I will not be satisfied with some general and—if I may call it so without appearing insulting—rather woolly undertaking to the effect that if I provide him with more evidence he will consider whether it is time to speak to the ABI and the BIBA and then consider whether at some time it will be wise to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not be sufficient. I have not come this far to be so easily bought off. I warn my hon. Friend of that in advance. In proposing the new clause, I remind hon. Members that we have here an opportunity, which we have not had before, to move forward on the basis of some agreement between the ABI and the BIBA, and I hope that my hon. Friend will respond in kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as it is the intention of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) to strengthen the insurance brokers' register, I am with him. I find the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act inadequate to deal with the broking section of the industry. I believe that as a result of personal constituency experience. Constituents of mine have lost many thousands of pounds in the Burrough Hammond and Wessex Trust affair. I wrote to the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and asked it to account for the losses and whether it could give assistance through its grant system. As it happens, I received a letter back today which said, "Under no circumstances"—for the highly specious reason that the council believes that the business concerned did not make the proper declarations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents continue to suffer, because of inadequacies in terms of the registration. Considerable suffering has been caused and thousands of pounds of personal savings were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The centre of the argument about the new clause is whether it is in order to have such a provision in this Bill. That question was addressed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Although I applaud his motives, I hope that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar will not seek to press the new clause, as I believe, for three reasons, that it would be inappropriate. First, this is not the right Bill for the task; secondly, the way that the new clause is drafted makes it anticompetitive, and, thirdly, I believe that the drafting is inadequate in other ways also, which I would detail if I had the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the matters that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar seeks to cover would be better dealt with elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>961</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My main concern about the new clause is that it goes against the drift of not only the times but of the general tenor of the Bill. It would be anticompetitive. The provisions of chapter XII that deal with the functions of the Director General of Fair Trading have already been covered, but in dealing with financial services generally we must ensure that what Sir Gordon Borrie once described as a proper amount of weed killer in relation to competition should be preserved. The new clause is highly monopolistic. It creates a new protective title against which there would be severe penal sanctions. Its general trend is monopolistic in the worst sense of the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that I support the IBRC. There may, or may not, be a case, in consultation with the IBRC, for a further look at whether its powers need to be enhanced. In the Administration of Justice Act 1985—I served on the Committee considering that Bill last year, with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and others—I pressed hard for the functions of the licensed conveyancer precisely because, contrary to some rather specious comments that are aimed at lawyers from both sides of the Committee, some of us genuinely believe that there are matters of monopoly within the professions that need to be sorted out. I sparred slightly—I hope in a friendly manner— with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on audit and accountancy. The drift of the times is in favour of more competition and less monopoly in the professions conjoined with a proper degree of confidence. I fear that the suggestions in new clause 7 would cut across all those criteria and that is why I ask the Committee to resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would be anti-competitive in restricting the sale of insurance policies to a limited number of businesses. It would be anti-consumer because it would severely restrict consumer choice, as large numbers of intermediaries would be driven out of the market. They would reduce the amount of insurance sold, the consequence of which would be a greater drain on social security benefits as people die and homes are damaged without the provision of adequate insurance cover. Its general effect in terms of the Bill and market development and its importance to the economy would be the reduction in the number of businesses and the sale of policies. That would have a depressing effect on the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intermediaries within paragraph (b) comprise about three quarters of all intermediaries placing business. They may be engaging in any one or a number of a wide variety of business activities and include individuals and small firms instead of substantial companies as well as building societies and professional firms such as accountants and solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would produce an unnecessary restriction on the many policyholders placing business with intermediaries and I strongly recommend that the new clause is thrown out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I support much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said in moving in the new clause. It is disgraceful that a person can, merely by changing his name from insurance broker to insurance consultant or adviser, avoid the provisions of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>962</span>
In saying that, I declare an interest. In my own profession it is equally scandalous that a person can call himself a surveyor if he is not a chartered surveyor and similarly mislead the public. There are numerous examples of that throughout the professions and commerce. It is high time that we had a general review of what is necessary for the protection of the public while remaining consonant with the need to maintain maximum competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative suggestion that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar outlined is not impossible. It would be reasonable to limit this to full-time intermediaries. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will be able to assure my hon. Friend that the Department will take on board at least the general thrust of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I came to the debate with an open mind, aware of the strong representations that many of us have received showing concern and opposition to the new clause. However, I was aware that, following some incidents over the past decade as well as recently, many individuals are vulnerable—and will be increasingly so—to irresponsible practices which might be without regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) ingenious and quite persuasive. In particular his arguments about equivalence were almost irrefutable, and his argument that it should be included was challenging at the very least. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will be able to reply constructively. If the new clause were put to a Division now, I should be inclined to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to repeat an earlier speech, but the Minister should recognise the powerful case that his hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) has made. He should at least take some responsibility for producing a consensus on the basis of which we could achieve a solution to the problem rightly raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a powerful case for regulating general insurance, which the change wrought by the Bill makes more pressing. I am uneasy about forcing the change through against the opinion of a divided insurance profession, as it would then be a difficult instrument to use. However, if a consensus is possible, the Minister has a responsibility to find and encourage it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by paying tribute to the close attention which my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) has paid to the issue over a long period, and to his distinguished contribution in drawing it to the attention of a wider audience and illuminating the issues to which it gives rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that there are no problems and that nothing needs to be done. I should like to encourage any emerging and developing consensus in the industry, but I have difficulties with the new clause and reference has been made to them by other Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view that the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for such matters as it concerns a special and separate category of investment business. If one attempted to extend that category to general insurance which is not investment business, other candidates
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>963</span>
would present themselves, many of which would give rise to similar difficulties and problems to those posed by general insurance. It would be unfortunate to set off on that trail—or slope. Investment business is in a separate category which has commanded general recognition in discussions on the Bill, and that is an important principle which should not be breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for me to conceal from my hon. Friend that I approach the problem predisposed against introducing fresh statutory burdens in the area of general insurance. My approach to those matters is that we should reduce, rather than add to, the burdens on small businesses. At present, it is open to insurance businesses to join the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and to register under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977.1 encourage the IBRC and the British Insurance Brokers Association to make more widely known the advantages that the consumer may obtain, if he uses the services of insurance brokers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more the public appreciate the significance of the term "broker", the greater incentive there will be for insurance businesses to become brokers, members of the IBRC and to register under the 1977 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear to Committee members that I start with a scepticism about the appropriateness of fresh statutory burdens in that respect. That is an attitude shared by my predecessor, which he made clear to the industry during his consultations. There now appears to be a sign of an emerging consensus within the industry. I should like to see that consensus develop so that non-statutory self-regulation of the general insurance industry can be developed, improved and enhanced. I am prepared to play whatever part is necessary to achieve that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from the Association of British Insurers, mentioned in the debate, appears to represent a change in the position of that body. As a first step, I should be happy to institute talks between the ABI, BIBA and other interested parties, so that we may explore together the possibilities for progress to be made on a consensual basis. If the parties present at those talks think that an inquiry into the workings of the Act and the council would be useful, I would not shut the door on the possibility of such an inquiry. Let us proceed in that way and look at the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say a few words about the instances cited by my hon. Friend, so that we look at the evidence in proper perspective. My hon. Friend referred to the unfortunate episodes that took place in the early 1970s—the failure of the Fire, Auto & Marine insurance company and of the Vehicle & General insurance company, for example. But those failures were followed by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975, which led to a substantial increase in the protection now available to policyholders, and obviates the consequences of such failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I deal also with the instance that my hon. Friend drew to the Committee's attention, based on the recent article 	<i>The Times.</i> As I understand that, the problems in relation to that episode arose on the life, not on the general side. Life insurance is a matter covered by the Bill. The general insurers have accepted responsibility
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>964</span>
for the acts of the agents involved, and have honoured claims on policies, although they did not receive full premiums. I am not sure that that incident supports the case being made for an extension of regulation. There may be instances where policyholders lose, and where it would be possible and desirable for improved arrangements to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Minister will recall that, in quoting from the article in 	<i>The Times,</i> I conceded that the matter stemmed from cases involving life assurance. But I said, too, that general insurance companies are also involved in this case and that, although, on this occasion, the general insurers have been prepared to pick up the tab with no adverse effect on the policyholders, it is folly to assume that that would always be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When referring to the debacles of the Vehicle & General and the Fire, Auto & Marine insurance companies, my hon. and learned Friend mentioned the Policyholders Protection Act 1975, but omitted to mention the Insurance Companies Act 1974, to which I referred. He will realise that in both instances the solution to the difficulties was statutory. Will he tell us why the scenario that I have suggested might not also have a statutory solution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As those measures have been placed on the statute book, with the beneficial results to which I referred, I see no need at present for an extension of statutory regulation in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no secret to my hon. Friend of the way I approach the matter. We should not hasten to increase statutory regulation in that respect, but should examine the abuses and grievances and see how they can best be remedied. If we conclude that there is widespread abuse in a specific field, and that that abuse can be satisfactorily remedied only by statutory action we shall consider such action. But we are a very long way from that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy to promote, and for Department officials to participate in, talks between the various parties to which we have referred, to examine the extent to which a consensus exists and to find the best way of bringing that consensus forward in the context of improved self-regulation. I am conscious that that falls some way short of what my hon. Friend has asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have listened with care to the Minister's comments. Does he not recognise that, in setting his face so firmly against a statutory resolution to the problem, he is not going as far as the Association of British Insurers would contemplate? It states in its letter that it would be prepared to accept an extension of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 to the matters that it mentions—that is, in respect of the independent, full-time insurance intermediary. In approaching talks between the ABI and BIBA, will he at least leave open that possibility, recognised by the ABI itself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly, one of the matters to be explored in such talks would be the meaning of the reference in the letter to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory regulation must be a matter for the Government, not simply for a consensus of parties in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>965</span>
the industry. It would not be sufficient to persuade me to say simply that the parties had agreed that that was an appropriate course to take. I would need evidence of widespread abuse, which can best be remedied by statutory measures. I have not yet seen such evidence and am, therefore, rather sceptical that that would be my conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that, when dealing with protection of title with swingeing penalties attached—which is increasingly against the trend of the times—the highest degree of competence and qualification would have to be justified? Does my hon. and learned Friend also agree that the matter should be considered under other legislation, if at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the latter of the two points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), that it should not be looked at in the context of this legislation. I have no desire to be nudged further away from the points that have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and I do not wish to respond particularly to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, but although I am conscious that what I am suggesting as the appropriate course falls someway short of what my hon. Friend asks for, I hope that he will accept it as a genuine and constructive attempt to respond to his anxieties. I hope that what emerges from the exercise that I am prepared to promote will be a considerable enhancement of regulation in the general insurance business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I may be disappointed by his reply. That puts it very mildly indeed. It falls very far short of the minimum that would satisfy me. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will not think it impertinent if I say that in listening to his response I would never have known that one of his responsibilities is consumer affairs. He took an altogether too doctrinaire approach, and I regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to say that we must first prove that excesses exist and act later. Surely that is akin to closing the door after the horse has bolted. History over the past decade in this sphere is littered with examples of the consequences of taking such a line. I have mentioned Fire, Auto and Marine and Vehicle and General. I might mention the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act or the Financial Services Bill. We are being asked to react after some of the worse excesses have been perpetrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that I am disappointed is to put it mildly. For the Government not even to be prepared to move towards the industry consensus, to which my hon. and learned Friend referred, is extremely disappointing. He said that perhaps we should try to build on the emerging consensus. The consensus is there under two principal headings in the letter from the ABI which I quoted. My hon. and learned Friend was not even prepared to say which was the stronger or the weaker of those, either of which I said that I might be prepared to accept as a move in the right direction. That is extremely disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend says that people are greatly encouraged to apply to register as brokers. I endorse that, but the existence of the freedom to apply for registration under the 1977 Act did not prevent the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>966</span>
development of what I can only call cowboys in the industry. Can my hon. and learned Friend overlook all his responsibilities and say that he will go no further than to act as the go-between in discussions between the ABI and the BIBA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend talked of imposing further statutory regulations. I have no particular feeling that we should have statutory regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) in his frequent interventions continues to refer to the new clause, to which admittedly I am ostensibly still speaking, but I thought that I had made it clear that I am now talking about an attempt to find a middle course, which would be acceptable to the Minister, because it does not presuppose that there must necessarily be statutory regulation of non-life intermediaries, thereby enhancing the industry, no one would be more pleased than I, but, as I am not prepared to exclude the possibility of self-regulation, why is my hon. and learned Friend prepared seemingly to exclude all prospects of statutory regulation, if that is proved to be required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Minister talks in general terms about bringing together the ABI, the BIBA and others. That is splendid. I accept that, and I am sure that most of the industry will, but it cannot stop there. As a minimum, we must examine the adequacy of consumer protection for purchasers of non-life insurance where an intermediary is involved, and make recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am coming down from the extremity of the new clause almost to the base, below which I cannot allow my hon. and learned Friend the Minister to push me. To leave matters as he has sought to leave them would create too many loose ends, but if I could persuade him to agree to a movement towards an inquiry on that basic term of reference—which I am perfectly happy to repeat if he did not hear me the first time—then honour will be satisfied and this lengthy debate will not have been in vain. I do not believe that that is asking too much; I do not believe that it is outside his power in this Committee to grant that. Therefore, will he not agree at least to look into it more thoroughly than his earlier reply suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I cannot go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) has invited me to go, in that I cannot say here and now that there will be an inquiry and it will have such-and-such terms of reference. I certainly do not exclude the possibility of such an inquiry emerging from the talks that, as I have said, I should be happy to promote. However, at this stage I do not want to prejudge their outcome. I hope that they will be constructive and that the outcome will be precisely what I understood my hon. Friend to be emphasising as his objective—namely, an improved and enhanced regime for self-regulation of the general insurance industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I cannot go further than that, but I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that my intention to

see improved self-regulation—and enhanced protection for the consumer—is genuine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disinclined to divide on the new clause, not least because my position has moved from its original terms. I detected a slight shift of attitude in the last utterance of my hon. and learned Friend, and it would be helpful if we all study both sides of the argument when 	<i>Hansard</i> is produced. Therefore, without prejudice to my returning to this—not only on Report, but if we make no progress then, on future occasions—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>(3) The Secretary of State may by order delegate his powers under this section to the Securities and Investments Board".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause, which has been tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), concerns the investigation of unauthorised persons by the Securities and Investments Board. The arguments in its favour are stronger, and more objective, than any other that I have put forward in the course of the Bill, apart from those for the statutory recognition of the Securities and Investments Board. I would go so far as to say that whether or not the Securities and Investments Board is a statutory body or has powers of prosecution, it should have the power, which I propose in the new clause, to investigate unauthorised persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Securities and Investments Board protect investors, if it is unable to investigate allegations that unauthorised investment business is being conducted? Such activities are a serious matter. Clause 4 makes the carrying on of investment business without authorisation a criminal offence for which a person can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined. Moreover, agreements with an unauthorised investment business
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>968</span>
are unenforceable and an injunction can be sought against its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those provisions are a measure of the seriousness with which the Government regard unauthorised investment activities. Despite that, the Securities and Investments Board, which is responsible for overseeing the good conduct of the free and fair market in which investors' interests will be protected, may not investigate unauthorised businesses. It may only investigate authorised businesses, which it is far less likely to want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investors should be protected against unauthorised businesses. How is that to be done unless such businesses can be investigated? They can be investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry under powers reserved for the Secretary of State, but I question whether the Department has the resources or is willing to investigate the myriad cases that may be brought to its attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 92, the Secretary of State can investigate any case, whether the business is authorised or unauthorised. He can require a business to appear before him, to furnish documents, and to answer questions, and, if it fails to do so, there is a penalty of imprisonment for up to six months and a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public are and will be increasingly vulnerable to those who come knocking on their door, professing to be legitimate investment businesses that wish to advise them, act on their behalf as brokers, or to sell them investment instruments of one sort or another. Most people will not know that there is a difference between an authorised and an unauthorised investment business, so we have a responsibility to construct a framework that will deter unauthorised businesses from peddling their illegal wares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deterrent will be greater, if the Securities and Investments Board, which has the day-to-day responsibility for overseeing such matters and is closer to the investment markets than is the Department of Trade and Industry, has the power to investigate unauthorised persons. That power is expressly excluded from those that clause 96 gives to the board. By conferring that power, we shall enhance investment protection in an acceptable way which does not destroy the integrity of what my hon. and learned Friend is trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Securities and Investments Board cannot protect investors if it is unable to investigate allegations that unauthorised investment business is being conducted. As, after the passage of the amendment this morning, the board can now prosecute, it should be able to investigate adequately beforehand any matters within its competence that may have been transgressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that my amendment on insider dealing was not accepted. However, there is a material difference between seeking to give Securities and Investments Board powers to investigate insider dealings and powers to investigate unauthorised persons. Insider dealing is a criminal offence, under separate legislation, which allows, as my hon. and learned Friend said, draconian powers of investigation which he did not feel were appropriate for SIB. My hon. and learned Friend's arguments prevailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unauthorised persons are different, and the offence is different. Unauthorised persons are conducting businesses which, if authorised, would be susceptible to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>969</span>
investigation by SIB. It is implicitly recognised in clause 96 that SIB has the resources and expertise to oversee, therefore there is every case for unauthorised investment business to be investigated by SIB before prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-regulating organisations can investigate authorised businesses under their control, and therefore SIB will, if powers are delegated to it, be able to investigate authorised businesses which it directly authorises. But neither SIB nor the SROs will be able to investigate people who purport to be authorised, but are not. Yet those are the worst offenders, who prey upon the public and who, in doing so, have given rise to the worries that gave birth to the Bill. Those bodies will not be allowed even to look at the affairs of unauthorised persons, or to question them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why my hon. and learned Friend was hesitant about extending the power to SIB, even as a private regulatory body. I assumed that he might have thought it inappropriate that anyone other than the Secretary of State should have powers to go to any private person not ostensibly carrying on authorised investment business. That was right, as we must observe natural civil rights and not give the power to call for papers, ask those people to attend meetings or demand that they answer questions when they may be wholly innocent and may not be conducting an investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the powers in clause 92, which the Secretary of State can, interestingly, delegate to anyone else under clause 93, are not as draconian as those directed towards insider dealing. It is wholly reasonable that they should be exercised for authorised businesses, and therefore are the minimum that should be exercised, and should be given to SIB to exercise, in the case of unauthorised businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 93, the Secretary of State can authorise any "competent person" to investigate unauthorised business, but at the same time clause 96 expressly limits SIB to investigation of authorised persons only. When we touched on the issue in earlier debates, my hon. and learned Friend suggested that we could get round the problem under clause 93, as it allowed him to delegate to SIB or any competent person powers to investigate, and that therefore we need to not worry. But SIB is now a statutory body, and has powers to prosecute. I believe, that most members of the public think that it is charged with the responsibility of authorising investment businesses to carry on legitimate business. They also believe that the board is responsible for ensuring that those who are not authorised are identified and put out of business, and it is surely logical and compelling that that last remaining power should be credited to SIB on delegation. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will accept the new clause without my pressing it. I regret, naturally, that some of my earlier arguments did not prevail on him, but I suggest to him, and to my hon. Friends, that while I understand our differences on those earlier amendments, there are compelling reasons, in the strongest public interest, for accepting the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the investigation should be left exclusively to the DTI which has neither the resources nor the inclination to investigate individual traders in response to a complaint. It is in the public interest to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>970</span>
ensure that the SIB is equipped for the job that is laid down in the Bill and that most members of the public believe it is already doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great care to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). I hope that he will forgive me if I begin on a negative note, but his new clause poses considerable difficulties. I imagine that he is not wedded to the specific words used. For example, if the words were taken literally, the board or agency would be able to investigate the affairs of an unauthorised person even if that person were not required to be authorised and were not carrying on investment business. I hope that that was not my hon. Friend's intention, and that what he had in mind was the unauthorised person carrying on investment business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause goes on to state:
	<br><q><p>"whom it has reason to believe has infringed any of the provisions of the Act."</p></q>
Surely a person, whether conducting investment business or not, who seems to have infringed a provision of the Act should be investigated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that follows, but if that is the intention of the new clause my remarks may not be as helpful as I intended. However, I shall suggest a way forward that might meet the worries of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 96(5) imposes a prohibition on transferring the investigation powers in clause 92 in the case of unauthorised persons who appear to be carrying on investment business. I cannot commit myself, but I should like to consider amending clause 96(5) to remove that prohibition. That would allow the board or agency to have investigation powers in the case of unauthorised persons who appear to be carrying on investment business. That possibility should be considered in the context of the change in the Bill to confer prosecution powers on the agency and board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of that prohibition has implications for the new clause. I am endeavouring to be constructive and I hope that my suggestion will meet the concern of my hon. Friend that he will feel able to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has suggested a neater solution to the problem than might have been achieved in the new clause. It is for his hon. Friends to judge whether his undertaking is sufficiently precise and firm to enable them not to press the new clause. If they were to press it, it would have the support of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might I encourage the Minister to firm up the undertaking by reinforcing and adopting the arguments that his hon. Friend so persuasively advanced. We are not considering anything in the nature of an extension to the powers of the SIB, but rather the necessary clarification of its intrinsic powers. It is hard to see how the SIB could perform its role effectively if it were hemmed in by the current provision in clause 96.

The hon. Member for Chichester has explained clearly and persuasively that a Securities and Investments Board which, in general terms, will patrol the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>971</span>
area of authorisation, must have the ability to determine the outer limits of that area. But it cannot do so unless it has the power to go putatively beyond those limits to decide which firms should be included within the area of authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, there could be firms which were authorised once, firms which ought to be authorised and firms which claim to be authorised. All such cases would require investigation by a Securities and Investments Board which would be carrying out the exact task that the Minister has in mind. We are not saying, "Here is an add-on power for the SIB." We are merely saying that the SIB has to have that power to carry out its role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Minister to look with equal favour on new clause 14. It has been designed to provide a power of investigation that is more far-reaching, more effective and speedier than that which currently exists under clauses 92 and 93. Nothing in the Bill corresponds to the provisions of section 14(8) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers under clause 92 are welcome and go a long way to meeting our requirements. However, events could be speeded up considerably if a statutory power were to enable the Secretary of State to authorise someone to turn up at the door, obtain access, and seize papers. That is an essential element which I think that the Minister recognised in the far-reaching powers on insider dealing. For the SIB to function effectively, it needs powers that are similarly far-reaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not support new clause 8. However, I believe that new clause 14, proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has a great deal of merit because investigations would be carried out by properly competent persons. It rolls up the provisions suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). I would support new clause 14 if it were pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has been most helpful and sympathetic. He has quite rightly directed our attention towards clause 96(5), which contains two restrictions. Lines 20 and 21 include the words
	<br><q><p>"only where the person under investigation is an authorised person or exempt representative".</p></q>
Clause 96(5)	<i>(b)</i> is equally worrying. If the SIB were investigating an authorised investment business, it would not be able to use its powers under clauses 92, 93 and 94 in relation to someone who was not authorised because of the restriction in paragraph 	<i>(b).</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend has said that he would consider the possibility of amending subsection 	<i>(5)(b).</i> It would be very helpful if he could undertake to remove paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> and the wording to which I have referred in subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am much obliged to my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the helpful and positive way in which he has responded to the new clause, which has enjoyed support from both sides of the Committee. I do not want to press the new clause to a Division—I believe that it would be accepted—but I should like my hon. and learned Friend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>972</span>
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to do more than undertake to consider the matter. I should like him to undertake to introduce an amendment, preferably on Report, to ensure that if the SIB has delegated powers it can investigate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want my hon. and learned Friend to say that he will consider the matter. If other counsels prevail, he can get his business through more easily in the House than he can in Committee in the next few minutes. I may be proved wrong, but all hon. Members know that those are the facts. If my hon. and learned Friend is persuaded by my arguments and if, as I believe, he means what he has said, it is only fair that he undertakes to change the Bill, not just to consider the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith)? If the present requirement of clause 96(5) that the functions can be transferred only when the person under investigation is
	<br><q><p>"an authorised person or exempt representative"</p></q>
goes, paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> will fall for consideration in the same context. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that many of the considerations applying to the phrase in the body of the subsection also apply to paragraph
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) will not press me too far. I shall not give him an undertaking now, but I hope he will reflect upon the fact that during our proceedings I have been absolutely straightforward about my intentions. Sometimes, perphaps to my cost, I said that I was not prepared to consider alterations to the Bill or that I intended to reserve changes on Report where I firmly believed that that was the proper course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not give my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester an undertaking now. I wanted to hear now he moved his new clause and reflect upon it. I take the most careful note of what my hon. Friend says. He has advanced some cogent arguments, and I should not offer to consider in the most genuine way the effect of the new clause if I did not seriously intend to give it the most constructive consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the spirit in which he responded. I do not doubt his good intentions and I hope that he will not take it personally if I press the new clause to a Division. Once the new clause is included in the Bill, a better drafted clause can be inserted on Report if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome my hon. and learned Friend's willingness to consider my arguments carefully but it falls short of rectifying what many of us believe to be a glaring omission. I should be happier for the Bill to go on to Report with the new clause than to wait upon further consideration. With a slight regret I feel bound to press the new clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION OF LIABILITY OF SELF-REGULATING ORGANISATIONS AND RECOGNISED INVESTMENT EXCHANGES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"A recognised self-regulating organisation or a recognised investment exchange shall not be liable in damages by reason only of any failure to comply with any requirement imposed on it by Schedule 2 or 3 to this Act.".—	<i>[Mr. Butterfill.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>974</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for tabling the new clause arises from difficulties that could exist for an SRO or recognised investment exchange if they could be technically liable for damages for the breach of schedules 2 or 3. Those schedules were not intended to impose a statutory responsibility on a recognised investment exchange or an SRO; they were inteded to lay down the criteria for recognition of such bodies and, as such, they are simply means by which the eligibility of such bodies can be judged. It seems that unless we allow such organisations some protection, at least from a claim under this heading, we shall seriously prejudice their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the new clause would not reduce he protection afforded to investors. That protection would still exist under the common law remedy of negligence should an SRO fail to uphold its rules or breach its duty of care in any way. So the new clause simply seeks to clarify what should be the position and I hope that my hon. and learned Friend can accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the fears that underlie the new clause. The requirements of schedules 2 and 3 are necessarily subject, as so much will depend on the circumstances of a particular recognised self-regulating organsiation or recognised investment exchange and the type of investment business with which it is concerned. The question whether an organisation or exchange has failed to comply with any requirement is, with only a few exceptions, a question of judgment rather than of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he seeks. The requirements for recognition in schedules 2 and 3 are simply that. They are the requirements which must, in the opinion of the Secretary of State of designated agency, be satisfied if an organisation or exchange is to be recognised. If a recognised SRO or recognised investment exchange subsequently fails, in the opinion of the Secretary of State or designated agency, to satisfy one of the requirements, clauses 11 to 13 set out the actions that can be taken. However, there is no statutory duty on an SRO or a recognised investment exchange to comply with the requirements in the relevant schedule and failure to comply would not give rise to liability in damages for breach of statutory duty, which is the fear underlying the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those remarks, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. It is my pleasure to be the Tail-end Charlie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that clause 106 provides consequential exemptions from competition law for recognised self-regulating organisations, recognised investment exchanges and recognised clearing houses, but it does not provide any such exemption for recognised professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>976</span>
I am sorry that the matter was drawn to my attention after we had dealt with clause 106. That is why I have sought to deal with it by tabling a new clause. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will look at what appears to be a genuine anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause bears on an important but I fear complex, aspect of the provisions of the Bill as it relates to recognised professional bodies. As members of the Committee will recognise, clauses 101 to 109 are designed to replace the provisions of the Fair Trading Act, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and the Competition Act with provisions especially designed to deal with matters covered by the new regulatory regime. In relation to recognised self-regulating organisations, their primary function will be to regulate investment business so that the application of the new competition arrangements present little difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With recognised professional bodies, however, the position is less clear-cut. The primary purpose of these bodies will not be to regulate investment business. In some cases they are likely to regulate investment business by means of existing rules applying to the practice of the profession generally. The special competition regime provided under the Bill will not be appropriate to deal with such general rules. A rule might, for instance, have an anti-competitive effect which could be justified in terms of investor protection in so far as it applies to investment business, but not as it applies to other aspects of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new clause does not apply the competition regime of the Bill to RPBs at all. Further, it fails to take account of the likely dual function of at least some of the recognised professional bodies rules and, as a result, may confer wider exceptions from the competition legislation than would be warranted even if recognised professional bodies were within the Bill's competition regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I share my hon. Friend's concern at the prospect that identical rules of an RSRO and recognised professional body would be subject to different competition provisions. This is a very difficult area, but I am considering what can be done to put those of a recognised professional body's rules that deal with investment business on the same footing as an RSRO's rules in this respect. My hon. Friend's proposed new clause, however, would go further and would grant to recognised professional bodies and to their members the exemptions from competition law which will be enjoyed by RSROs and their members without providing the necessary counterbalances, which, for RSROs, are contained in clauses 101 to 105.1 hope that my hon. Friend will agree that that would unbalance the competition provisions as they apply to recognised professional bodies, and that he will therefore withdraw the clause. As I have said, I am conscious of the issue and will consider possible solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. and learned Friend has recognised that there is a genuine difficulty here. It is not possible to include recognised professional bodies in the same way as the other organisations which exist specifically to deal with investment business. I am very heartened by his warm and friendly undertaking to consider the matter seriously. I hope that he will devote much time to it over the coming weeks as

You seem, Sir John, to have the happy knack of turning up in a Committee just at the appropriate moment.

We have worked, as a Committee, in an extremely amiable and constructive atmosphere, which has been much to the benefit of our proceedings, though it has not prevented us from debating fiercely, dividing where necessary and showing our breaches of opinion where appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perhaps a little more enthusiastic than the Minister about some of the changes that we have made. There are others that I should like to have seen, but which he was able to frustrate. Nevertheless, these have been extremely enjoyable Committee proceedings, and I believe that the Bill is better as a consequence of them, and that we have all made our contributions to the best possible effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When I was a boy, in the plaudits at the end of Standing Committees, the Government thanked the Chairman, the Opposition usually thanked the Chairman, and that was that.
