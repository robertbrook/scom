<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Financial Services Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Last Thursday morning I mentioned that my amendment No. 325 to clause 122 had not been selected then, and it has not been selected today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not select it, but if the hon. Member has read <i>Hansard</i> he will have seen that I was anxious to give him a ruling at our last sitting but he was not present, so I shall give that ruling now. I have not selected amendments Nos. 325 and 309 because neither alters the meaning of clause 122(1). In my opinion, the preparation of listing particulars means the finalisation of and the completion of such particulars. The two amendments are therefore unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. First, I apologise for not having been here when you had hoped to give your ruling last week, and secondly I find your interpretation of the English language most instructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that interpretation, as I take it, of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. My amendment No. 309 is directed to the same point. It is exactly the meaning of "preparation" to which the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and my own are directed. We tabled those amendments because we felt that "preparation" described a process rather than a point in time.<br><br>
Although I am extremely grateful to you, Sir Michael, for your ruling on why the amendments have not been selected, it seems unfortunate that the Committee cannot put to the Minister its anxieties about the drafting of this provision. It might be helpful if the Minister could tell us at the appropriate time that your interpretation and meaning, Sir Michael, of "preparation" is also his own and therefore likely to be the interpretation that the courts and others would place on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentlemen must understand that I have given my ruling. We are now entering a debate on my ruling, which I cannot allow.<br><br>
I should like to add this to assist the Committee. This has been a very good Committee but I have noticed, unusually for Committees, that if hon. Members find that their amendments have not been selected for one reason or another—other hon. Members have also done this previously, so I raise the matter now— they have raised the matter on a point of order. They may consult the Clerk to find out discreetly the position that arises, and perhaps second thoughts will prevail. I am satisfied with my ruling and it must stand.<br><br>
We shall come later to a debate on clause 122 and rather than seeming to challenge the ruling, hon. Members may raise points on the matter in the general
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 816</span>
debate on clause stand part. Perhaps we can now move on.</span></p>

Clause 118</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
APPLICATIONS FOR LISTING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 91, leave out lines 7 to 13.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 296.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsections (3) and (4) are intended to implement provisions in the admission directive, one of the three EC directives on official stock exchange listing, which require applications for listing of debt securities to cover all the issuer's securities of the same class, that is which rank pari passu.<br><br>
Under English law, the concept of "pari passu" is relevant only to winding up and, for that purpose all debt securities of an issuer rank pari passu if they are neither secured nor subordinated. That does not seem to be what the directive intended, but it has been represented to us by the stock exchange and the Law Society that subsections (3) and (4) could have the effect that, if an issuer applies to have an unsecured debt securities listed, simultaneous application would have to be made for all its other unsecured debt securities.<br><br>
We think that the matter can be dealt with in listing rules rather than in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 296, in page 91, line 17, leave out from "relate" to end of line 18.—<i>[Mr. Howard.]</i></p>

ADMISSION TO LIST</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 280, in page 91, line 24, leave out subsection (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 281, in page 92, line 8, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) if it considers that the requirements of the listing rules in force when the application is made or any other requirements imposed by it in relation to that application are complied with".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 282, in page 92, line 9, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 119 deals with the admission to listing of securities. Subsection (1) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The competent authority shall not admit any securities"</p></blockquote>
to listing unless it is satisfied that two conditions are complied with. Subsection (3) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The competent authority may refuse an application"</p></blockquote>
in two specific circumstances. There is an anomaly, because under subsection (1) the competent authority is prohibited from granting listing, and under subsection (3) it is permitted to refuse an application. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 817</span>
distinction is confusing and unnecessary. Therefore, the purpose of the amendments is to leave out subsection (1) and to insert the same provision into subsection (3), so that matters are dealt with in a permissive rather than mandatory way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That distinction emanates from the directive. Therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 280 and 281. The admission directive states in article 3:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member states shall ensure that securities may not be admitted to official listing … unless the conditions laid down by the directive are satisfied".</p></blockquote>
The wording of subsection (1), which the amendment would remove, follows that mandatory language.<br><br>
By contrast, the proposed replacement to be added to subsection (3) is more discretionary and subjective: the authority may refuse an application if it considers requirements have not been complied with. That would not satisfactorily implement the listing directives.<br><br>
However, I understand the worry that breaches of the listing rules may give rise to actions by investors to avoid their contracts. Therefore, I have undertaken to introduce a Government amendment similar in effect to regulation 8(2) of the existing listing regulations to provide that the contract will not be avoidable by reason only of breaches of the requirements for listing.<br><br>
Amendment No. 282 also concerns the refusal of admission and involves complex and technical questions. The stock exchange has doubts about the scope of the phrase "certificates representing shares" in the directives and the way in which clause 119(4) implements the relevant provision in article 16 of the admission directive.<br><br>
I am prepared to consider that point further and, if necessary, table suitable amendments. I understand the concern that the subsection may go too wide. My officials will discuss the matter further with the stock exchange. In the light of my remarks, I hope that my hon. Friends will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. and learned Friend help me, and perhaps some other members of the Committee too? The application of European Community law in relation to this matter has caused anxiety in the stock exchange and has produced considerable correspondence.<br><br>
Could a note be prepared, as I suggested at the last sitting, drawing the line between what is actually required under the directive, and the extent to which this part of the Bill will add to the directive? It may be difficult, but it would be helpful to know what is specifically required under the directive and what is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Sir Michael, and to my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for not dealing with amendment No. 282 initially; I could not find my note.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend has helped me in one sense. The concept of "certificates representing shares" is not known in London. The stock exchange lists only the underlying security. One cannot buy certificates representing shares in London, only the shares. That concept appears in the directive to satisfy the requirements of continental stock exchanges.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 818</span>
First, why is the subsection in the Bill at all? Would it not be more appropriate to have the provision in the listing rules? We are not putting the whole directive into the Bill; the framework of the directive will be in the Bill, but the details will be kept to the listing rules. The stock exchange feels that the requirement would more appropriately be in the rules than in the Bill.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. and learned Friend has been helpful in saying that he will try to restrict the definition of "certificates representing snares". I have no reason to doubt my hon. and learned Friend when he says that the directive requires that the matter be dealt with in this way, and of course I accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that I had anticipated the argument that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) would raise. We are prepared to see whether we can meet the worries of the stock exchange.<br><br>
The request of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is somewhat onerous. I hope that he will be content if I tell him that there is no significant respect in which this part of the Bill goes further than what is required by the directive. Our prime concern in framing this part of the Bill has been not to go further than the directive requires, and we have not failed in that objective in any substantive way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. and learned Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be helpful if my hon. and learned Friend would accept amendment No. 282, and we omitted subsection (4). He would then have a nice blank space to return to on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) suggests. We are not yet wholly satisfied that the argument for amendment No. 282 has any substance. We are prepared to give the matter further, earnest consideration, and if we then feel that further steps should be taken, we shall not hesitate to take them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 305, in, page 91, line 41, after "publication", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and registration with the Companies Registry".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to amend clause 119(2), which provides that listing particulars should be made available to the public.<br><br>
Much of this ground is covered by clause 127, which makes a series of separate provisions. We have tabled amendments to clause 127 because it creates some difficulties in terms of keeping a register and of making it available to the public and so on if that obligation is to be placed on the stock exchange.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 305 is simply to remove that obligation from the stock exchange and to use the mechanism already available—namely, to provide for the registration of listing particulars through the companies register. I know that the Minister and his Department are now much more concerned
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 819</span>
to ensure that the companies register is kept up to date. The amendment would provide a simpler and more straightforward way of achieving that objective and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most sympathetic to the idea that there should be a requirement on issuers to deliver listing particulars to the appropriate company registrar as there is in the present listing regulations. I have received representations that such a requirement should be introduced and I undertake to introduce a suitable amendment at a later stage.<br><br>
The matter cannot be left to listing rules as the amendment proposes, since the registrar has to be given power to receive the documents. It will require a substantive provision in the Bill. Clause 127 will become redundant so I shall not move the Government amendments to that clause, nor shall I move that it should stand part of the Bill. With those undertakings I hope that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and I am glad that we are entirely ad idem here. In the light of the Minister's assurance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 306, in page 92, line 14, leave out "six" and insert "three".<br><br>
The amendment could scarcely be plainer on its face. It enables me to inquire why the competent authority should be allowed an apparently very long time to decide on an application and I suggest that the decision could be made in a shorter time to everyone's convenience. Will the Minister explain why the Bill specifies six months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would effectively impose a three-month deadline for the consideration of an application for listing. The six-month period mentioned in clause 119(5) was not plucked out of the air. It is specified in article 15 of the admission directive on which clause 119(5) and (6) is closely based. In practice, the stock exchange usually deals with applications well within six months and I am not aware of any widespread dissatisfaction with the time taken.<br><br>
I shall not resist the attempt to halve the period allowed for two reasons. First, the period of six months comes straight from the directives. It is strongly arguable that we have no freedom to choose another period. Secondly the procedure in clause 119(5) is intended not as a means of providing some sort of performance target, but as a long-stop to protect issuers in the unlikely event of an application becoming totally bogged down. Although it is clearly right to provide such a safeguard, it would not be in investors' interests if the stock exchange came under pressure from an issuer to dispose of an application before it had a reasonable opportunity to make the necessary inquiries.<br><br>
For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press it to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear, as I expected, that the stock exchange will not normally require six months to carry out its functions. When the Minister points to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 820</span>
requirements of the directive he reinforces the view of many Opposition Members that the directive is not in every respect as well drafted as it could be, but in the light of his remarks I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 358, in page 92, line 21, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) When any securities have been admitted to the Official List their admission shall not be called in question on the ground that any requirement or condition for their admission has not been complied with.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment fulfils an undertaking that I gave last week on amendment No. 279 tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).<br><br>
The stock exchange's listing rules contain a number of extremely detailed provisions on the manner of applications and the requirements for listing. There could thus be a danger that, if a, perhaps minor, requirement were not met, but the stock exchange overlooked that and granted listing, the listing could be challenged after the event and investors might seek to avoid contracts entered into on the basis of it.<br><br>
That would cause damaging uncertainty for issuers and, indeed, for investors who had bought and sold in the market. The amendments, therefore, provide that the grant of listing shall not be questioned on the ground that the admission requirements were not met. It follows that any transaction entered into on the basis of the admission to listing would not be void or voidable by reason only of any failure to meet the requirements.<br><br>
That continues the present position as regards voidability in this respect under regulation 8(2) of the listing regulations.<br><br>
The amendment does not affect investors' rights to compensation in damages for loss resulting from untrue or misleading statements, omission of any information required to be disclosed by the listing rules or the general duty or failure to produce supplementary listing particulars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee whether many complaints arise under the present arrangements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment which deals not only with one of the points raised under amendment No. 279, but goes wider. In Thursday's sitting, the Minister gave another assurance, and I hope that, when we come to clause 124, we shall have more good news regarding the liability of issuers.</span></p>

DISCONTINUANCE AND SUSPENSION OF LISTING</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>"and in such circumstances as may be specified in those rules".</p></blockquote>
Clause 120(2) deals with the suspension of listing. It enables the competent authority to suspend listing in accordance with the listing rules and in such circumstances as may be specified in those rules. Suspension of listing is not uncommon and often takes place at the issuer's request. It is resorted to if normal dealings become temporarily impossible for any reason, for example, if there are rumours that a bid is in the offing and the normal functioning of the market in the shares is impaired.<br><br>
The condition that suspension may take place in circumstances specified in the listing rules was intended to give the competent authority the maximum discretion to specify in its rules the circumstances in which listing may be suspended. The stock exchange has made representations that it is not practicable for it to specify in advance all the circumstances in which suspension may become necessary or desirable, and that the wording will reduce its flexibility. Accordingly, it has asked for this amendment to be made, and, as we do not wish to make the competent authority's task unnecessarily difficult, I commend the amendment to the committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 121 to 124 appear to require listing particulars to contain much more information than is required at present, but they leave some doubt about what is required and who is liable for any defaults. That does not seem to promote investor protection. Requiring an abundance of perhaps unnecessary and irrelevant information only serves to conceal important information from the investor. Listing particulars have expanded greatly in recent years; they are extremely onerous, and it has been suggested that they have taken a pretty severe toll of the world's forests.<br><br>
There is also the danger that this element of doubt may deter scrupulous issuers and encourage them to go to other markets, where they can operate with more confidence and certainty. It may also provide unscrupulous people with an opportunity to avoid their proper responsibilities.<br><br>
As the clause is drafted, listing particulars will be required to contain not just specific matters of concern to the securities, but also matters of a general nature— for example, matters relating to the economy which could be of concern to those securities. Such a requirement represents a considerable change in current practice.<br><br>
The clause does not take account of information that may be generally available to the market on which the securities are traded or which would not normally be expected to be found in listing particulars. For example, it requires full information relating to the issuing company to be included in any listing particulars issued on a rights issue, even though the market may have that information and it is reflected in the current market price.<br><br>
Additionally, the clause does not recognise that it may not be possible for someone responsible for listing particulars—which could include a company or other form of organisation—to divulge certain information that may be known to him or to it in a different capacity. For example, information may be held on the other side of one of those famous Chinese walls within
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 823</span>
a merchant bank, or subject to a duty of confidence owed by a banker to another client. Similarly, a person involved in the listing particulars could have information which he is prohibited from divulging under the insider dealing rules. These difficulties are covered in amendment No. 324, in subsection (2)(Z>).<br><br>
The clause does not require information to be given in relation to a relevant third party—for example, a guarantor of debentures issued by a finance subsidiary which have been guaranteed by the parent company. Where these securities confer a right of conversion into securities of another company, the clause does not require information material to that other company to be contained in the listing particulars. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will be able to help on these points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My amendment No. 307 is designed to probe the Minister's intentions in the clause. I sought to reproduce the general formulation of article 4 of the listing particulars directive as a means of asking the Minister why he thinks the clause is an improvement on that.<br><br>
I suspect that my motivation is different from that of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). It has been suggested to me that the change from article 4 to the provisions of the clause may make less relevant general expressions of opinion and judgment by directors, and those responsible, and to limit their obligations to statements of fact. That is a retrograde step if it is the consequence of the provision, though I am not convinced that it will be. I should like the Minister to assure me of that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 308 relates to subsection (3)(6). I should like to know the purpose and scope of the provision. Is it intended to allow a lesser degree of information to be provided to sophisticated or professional investors or in contrast for a greater degree of information than usual to be provided for unsophisticated investors who perhaps do not normally make such investments. I should like to know the thinking behind the provision and how far it is likely to extend.<br><br>
We would be against any substantial derogation from the normal requirements and standards on the ground that the people involved were sophisticated. We have yet to decide—or we do not have a mechanism for deciding—what "sophistication" should mean. If that is to be left to the subjective judgment of those responsible for the issue, it could be a wide and dangerous loophole. I hope that the Minister will give us guidance on how far that provision is intended to extend and also, more generally, on whether clause 121 is intended to alter the range of requirements listed in article 4 of the listing particulars directory.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clutch of amendments perhaps provides a better opportunity than clause stand part to raise a matter that has recently given me, the public, and investors cause for concern. I believe that the question of the need to include profit forcasts in both the listing documents and the prospectuses dealing with offers for sale is relevant and in order, because under subsection (l)(a) there is a general requirement, in addition to that specified by listing rules, that information on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 824</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"prospects of the issuer of the securities"</p></blockquote>
shall be included. I wish to ask my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary whether he is satisfied that the inclusion of the word "prospects" in paragraph <i>{a)</i> includes, in particular, profit forecasts. I suspect that the answer is that the word "prospects" goes rather wider than profits forecasts—and I would welcome that—but I should like an assurance that it would be unlawful for listing particulars to be published without a profit forecast.<br><br>
There has been anxiety about two aspects of profits forecasts. First, some wildly inaccurate and grossly optimistic profits forecasts have been included not only in listings documents, but in offers for sale and in takeover bids. Secondly, a spate of takeovers has generated much publicity in recent months. The technique of defence against takeovers has become almost American in its complexity and novelty. One of the means of trying to fend off a takeover has been for the company for which the bid has been made to come out with forecasts of substantial profits that bear little relation to past performance.<br><br>
Although we shall discuss the content of prospectuses of offers for unlisted securities under clause 135, the general issue applies as much to this clause, which deals with the general duty of disclosure in listing particulars. There is a difficult balance to strike here between ensuring that investors have adequate information on which to base their transactions of their purchases of securities and ensuring that impossible requirements are not imposed on issuers. Issuers can include something that is empirically verifiable, such as historic data on the company's performance, but the duty to make an absolutely accurate forecast of the company's worth and trading position in the future cannot be imposed on them. Nevertheless, there is little in prospectuses or listing details that is more important than an assessment of how the company will fare in the future. Profit forecasts, as well as divided forecasts—or possibly even revaluation forecasts—are central.<br><br>
We have an important duty to ensure that as far as possible statements to that effect are included in listing particulars and that they are statements of integrity. We shall come to the question of sanctions later, which is purely compensation for failure, and perhaps we can debate any inadequacies then. But at this stage, and on these clauses, I hope that my hon. and learned Friend can say something to reassure the public and those investors who are worried about practices in recent months of wildly optimistic and, as experience has shown, unattainable profit forecasts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary a question as the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) seems to go less far than the clause in requiring information.<br><br>
The clause requires information to enable a comparison with other securities in the same class to be made. That may impose a requirement for equivalence of information. How far does my hon. and learned Friend expect that requirement to be taken? We know that assets are capable of being included in a company's accounts, either on an acquisition cost basis, or another historic cost basis, or on a current valuation basis, or on a historic valuation basis. There are differences
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 825</span>
between the ways that companies treat interest charges; some companies roll up, or capitalise, their interest until a project has been completed, whereas others charge it direct to their profit and loss account every year. There are also differences in the way that companies approach depreciation of assets. I could enumerate many differences.<br><br>
Does the clause intend to lay down a standard procedure for the treatment of all those areas of accounting so that an accurate and direct comparison can be made in different classes of security?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first respond to the general point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) who asked about the relationship between the clause and the directive.<br><br>
The purpose of the clause is to translate article 4(1) of the directive—no more and no less. There is no intention to alter the general sense of the directive as the hon. Gentlemen diffidently suggested. That provides the general context in which the detailed points raised by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friends fall to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. and learned Gentleman, but if that is so, why is article 4 simply not reproduced? Why is the additional concept of comparability in relation to other securities of a similar class imported into the provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that question is of general application throughout this part of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman knows that it is not our practice to rely simply on the language of the directive, which is framed quite differently from the language normally adopted in this country to impose statutory rights and duties. The manner of implementing the directive is left by the directive to member states. We normally adopt directives by putting into normal statutory language the contents of those directives.<br><br>
I turn now to the specific points raised. The anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) are unfounded. He suggested that the clause went far and wide and he raised several issues on the language of the clause that he said would be required to be covered. The clause does not go as wide as my hon. Friend fears. We do not accept that the consequences to which he drew attention would follow from the clause. I am not saying that there is no scope for alteration in the language of the clause. Discussions can continue and if we are persuaded that improvements can be made, we would consider them.<br><br>
It is appropriate that subsection (3)(6) provides that less information shall be given to sophisticated investors. The hon. Member for Dagenham questioned whether there would be a subjective judgment on the category of investors to whom that subsection would apply. The duty is not subjective, but should be to consider objectively the category of people who are likely to acquire the security in question and the amount of information that those within that category would need. Those are objective tests. It is right to have a provision that permits less information to be provided to people in those categories.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) rightly suggested that the word "prospects"
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
goes wider than profit forecasts. The clause permits requirements to be made in relation to profit forecasts, but does not impose such requirements. It should be left to the stock exchange to decide whether any such requirement is to be made. Any wildly inaccurate or grossly optimistic forecasts would be covered by clause 44 as a criminal offence. A less wild inaccuracy or a less gross optimism may be a breach of clause 121 and constitute a civil liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what my hon. and learned Friend said about misleading statements being either a criminal offence under clause 44 or the subject of a law suit under, I think, clause 124. The Minister said that "prospects" goes wider than profit forecasts, but there is no obligation on the listing rules to include profit forecasts. Would he be surprised if the rules were not to include a requirement in this respect? Does he at least expect some rules on profit forecasts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter on which the Government has traditionally been reluctant to express a view. I am reluctant to depart from that tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter which can be left to the stock exchange. My hon. Friend asks, "Why". I shall put a hypothetical situation to him. The nature of a company's activities may be so uncertain or speculative that any profit forecast it made would probably be wrong. Therefore, it may be better for an indication of the prospects of that company to be given in some other way than by a profit forecast. I cite that example merely in response to my hon. Friend's question. It does not signify that I have a preference one way or the other. We think that the matter is best left to the stock exchange.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) asked about the phrase "of the same class". It relates to the decision to buy, for example, equities rather than gilts. The clause is intended to enable an investor to have sufficient information to make an informed and proper choice between investments "of the same class", but not to enable him to compare one class of investment with another. I hope that that explanation deals with the query of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West.<br><br>
For those reasons I invite the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that I advanced an earlier argument in a somewhat diffident fashion. A certain degree of tentativeness is enjoined on us as we know that the Government are in some uncertainty and indecision, and we have yet to see the final shape of their proposals.<br><br>
I was not persuaded by the Minster's general point about incorporating the language of the directive into our domestic legislation. I understand the general argument, but when it is applied to this specific instance the language of article 4 does not seem any different from the language that one would expect to find in the Bill. I am still not clear why we have used a different formulation if the intention is simply to give effect to the requirements of article 4.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0382">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
Like the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) I am even more puzzled about what the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"rather than others of the same class"</p></blockquote>
is doing in the clause. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West appears to think that it widens the test, but, in my view, it narrows it. Instead of requiring the listing particulars to offer the information that the investor needs to make a proper decision on all the matters specified in subsection (l)(a) and <i>(b),</i> the measure seems to require only the disclosure of information that would enable an investor to decide between securities in the same class. That is an unnecessary limitation which, as far as I can see, is not implied by article 4.<br><br>
The Minister and I share a common objective not to delay the Committee, but will he say a word on my question? I do not understand why the provision is couched in those terms.<br><br>
On sophisticated investors in subsection (3)(Z>), as so often we are in difficulties because we have not seen the rules. We do not know who will determine who are "sophisticated investors" and what criteria will be used. The Committee must simply live with that problem, but I was interested to hear what the Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was relieved by the assurance of my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary that my anxieties were unfounded. I am also pleased that the wording may be considered further. I hope that there will be discussions with the Law Society and, after a belated start, with the stock exchange.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and I am confused about why the phrase "of the same class" appears in the Bill. I support my hon. and learned Friend distinguishing, as subsection <i>(3)(b)</i> does, between different types of audience to whom the information may be aimed.<br><br>
I did not comment previously on amendment No. 307 tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) but it is couched in extremely vague language which might cause problems. For example, it could be argued that in an offer of securities under a privatisation issue, it would be necessary for the investor to have information about the Government's electoral prospects and other such political considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can well understand why the hon. Gentleman should wish to keep that information from the investor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I was about to say that presumably the hon. Gentleman felt confident about tabling the amendment in this way as it is clear that the present Government will be in power for all our respective lifetimes.<br><br>
It will not have escaped the attention of the Committee that since the date of the Fulham by-election was announced, the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has not appeared in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend for his explanation of what the different classes of securities will comprise. Indeed, I had assumed that interpretation.<br><br>
However, the purpose of my question was to discover whether the Minister feels that in order to make that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
comparison it will be necessary for the accounting procedures of all the companies or securities falling in the same class to be on an identical basis, or will there still be room for different accounting procedures? If there will, how will a valid comparison be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) must not think that when I suggested that his observations were somewhat diffident I was being critical. On the contrary, I welcome diffidence from the hon. Gentleman on every possible occasion.<br><br>
I have little to add to what I have already said on the hon. Gentleman's argument, or on those of my hon. Friends, save in one respect. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and the hon. Member for Dagenham both asked about the lack of equivalence adverted to in the phrase "of the same class". They interpreted the phrase in opposing ways and we ought to look at it again. When we do so, I shall see what we can do about the further aspect raised by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the remarks of my hon. and learned Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief query about subsection (3)(c) which at first glance appears rather curiously drafted. It appears to incorporate two separate requirements, going to some degree in opposite directions.<br><br>
The first half of the paragraph seems to suggest that a lesser degree of information may be needed because professional investors will be expected to have knowledge, while the second part suggests that account must be taken of the fact that investors' advisers will need additional information. It seems odd to include these separate criteria in the same subsection, but perhaps it is only a question of drafting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, althought I suggest that subsection (3)(c) covers both ideas effectively. However, we shall look at the paragraph again and see whether it can be clarified, although I see no difficulty.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with supplementary listing particulars, which covers changes, new matters, and mistakes in the particulars.<br><br>
The clause suffers from three principal defects. The first is that it treats changes in the state of affairs described in the listing particulars and errors in the particulars in the same manner. It would be preferable to confine supplementary particulars to changes and new matters, so that it is clear that no opprobrium attaches to having to issue them. Correction of errors should be made in a different form.<br><br>
The second defect is that the clause makes no provision for immaterial new matters to be ignored. Even where the Bill uses the word "significant" for changes and mistakes, there is considerable doubt about whether that means that they have to be significant in relation to the listing particulars as a whole or in relation to the relevant statement in the particulars. For instance, is a statement that the company secretary is 39, when he or she is 49, a significant mistake? If the company secretary's name is given as Miss Smith when it is Mrs, Ms, or even Mr. Smith, is that a significant mistake?<br><br>
Thirdly, it is unclear who is obliged to publish the supplementary particulars, and the wording suggests that the Bill could require the publishing of supplementary particulars before the listing particulars themselves were published.<br><br>
Amendment No. 327 would overcome all of those problems. Amendment No. 234 deals with the question of significance. Subsection (l)(a) refers to "a significant change" and (l)(c) refers to "a significant mistake", but <i>(\)(b)</i> refers to "a new matter", rather than to a significant new matter. If the Committee cannot agree to the comprehensive amendment No. 327, it may at least agree to the more modest amendment No. 234.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) about amendments Nos. 326 and 327, but I do not support the general idea of incorporating a requirement of materiality in the provision.<br><br>
My separate amendment No. 311 is on the amendment paper because a word was omitted from the formulation that the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) has also tabled in amendment No. 218.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was that errors should be provided for separately to remove adverse implications from the need for supplementary listing. We are prepared to consider that matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and my hon. Friend raised the question of materiality, or significance. I readily accept that supplementary listing particulars should not be required for changes, new matters, or mistakes that are of no consequence for the assessment of the securities. The clause already incorporates the principle underlying the amendments. I agree with their intention, but they are unnecessary in the main.<br><br>
Subsection (1) requires supplementary listing particulars in three cases: if there is a "significant change" affecting any matter included in the original particulars in compliance with the general duty of clause 121 or with the listing rules, if a new matter arises that would have had to be included if it had arisen in time, or if a person responsible for the particulars notices a "significant mistake".<br><br>
The first and last of those cases already include a test of significance, so trivial changes and mistakes will not require a supplement. Whether a change or mistake is significant will depend on whether a reasonable investor would, in all the circumstances of the offer, regard it as affecting his assessment of the securities. I doubt whether any of the examples that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield cited would come into that category.<br><br>
The wording of amendment No. 218 is lengthier than that in the clause, but offers no real advantage. Indeed, it seems less clear, as it does not state whose assessment is to be considered in deciding whether a supplement is needed. As regards new matters, the intention was that only a new matter of sufficient importance to have been included in its own right should require a supplement.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
On further consideration, I am not sure whether the clause achieves that result, and I am certainly prepared to undertake to look at the point and bring forward an amendment if necessary. Subject to that, it is surely sensible to apply the same criterion to new matters as to the material in the original disclosure, and not to use different wording as amendments Nos. 234, 218 and 311 do.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 326 and 327 would limit the circumstances in which supplementary listing particulars are required. A supplement would be required only if a new matter arises which would have been required to be disclosed by virtue of the clause 121 general duty. There is no provision for changes in other information required by listing rules or to rectify mistakes.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
It is necessary to balance, on the one hand, the interests of investors who should know of changes in the information which is the basis on which they are being asked to buy securities and, on the other hand, the interests of issuers not being required to issue supplements of no practical interest to investors. The clause strikes a reasonable balance and, subject to the points that I have mentioned, already contains sufficient conditions to avoid issuers having to produce supplements on trivia. However, having regard to the fact that it has been seen as not achieving that result, I am prepared to consider whether any further amendments are required. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) not to press their amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister is prepared to consider my first point is helpful. It may also be helpful to have his interpretation of "significant", and to know whether he would reconsider the question of a "new matter". I take the point that there is a distinction between, on the one hand, a "new matter", which should be subject to the same criteria as something included initially, and, on the other hand, changes and errors. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This might be an appropriate opportunity for the Minister to say a few words about the term "preparation" in clause 122(1), which worried both the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and myself. The term "preparation" seems to describe a process rather than a moment, and, therefore, to lack the precision which should be available in the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I approach the matter with the diffidence required in the light of your ruling, Sir Michael, and I hope that you will forgive me if I concede that the words "preparation" and "finalisation" clearly have different meanings. However, clause 122(1) refers to a "time after the preparation", and there is no difference between such a time, on the one hand, and "finalisation" on the other.</span></p>

<p>Government amendment No. 359</p>
<p>Government amendment No. 360.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The points in my amendments appear to have been covered by the Government amendments. I welcome that, but perhaps the Minister wishes to say a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. There is no difference between amendments Nos. 283, 285 and 288, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), and Government amendments Nos. 359 and 360, in addition to amendment No. 284, to which I have added my name.<br><br>
Their purpose is to refer in a different way to the competent authority's power to authorise the omission of material from listing particulars. The power to derogate from listing rule requirements is additional to the powers in clause 123 which enable omission of material otherwise required by the general duty, and a derogation may be granted in circumstances other than those specified in subsection <i>(l)(a), (b)</i> and (c).<br><br>
I am happy to have resolved any difficulty of interpretation that there may have been, and I am grateful to my hon. Friends for having drawn it to the Committee's attention in tabling their amendments. I hope that they will not press amendments Nos. 283, 285 and 288. I endorse amendment No. 284, and I commend Government amendments Nos. 359 and 360.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my hon. and learned Friend has said, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 284, in page 94, line 18, leave out "or by listing rules".—<i>[Mr. Howard.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 94, line 24, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"international securities (as denned in section 45(6) above)"</p></blockquote>
and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"investments falling within paragraph 2 or 3 of Schedule 1 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
Clause 123 gives effect to the provisions of articles 7 and 10 of the directive. However, the precise terms of the clause differ slightly from those of the directive. The effect is to give the competent authority less scope for exemptions than the directive would allow. Article 10 contains the wording
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the application for admission to official listing relates to debt securities".</p></blockquote>
That is the critical point. The article would permit a wider exemption than one confined to international securities as defined in clause 45(6). The international character of a particular class of securities is not one of the qualifications for exemption under article 10, which would permit exemptions for virtually any type of debt security, either domestic or international, normally bought and traded by professional investors.<br><br>
The amendment would extend the potential exemption to UK debt securities. It could go wider than the directive would permit as there is no reference to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
character of the investors buying and trading the securities.<br><br>
We should aim to comply with the directive, but to go no further. I should be grateful if the Minister could consider something along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 123(1) is intended to give the competent authority discretion to authorise derogations from disclosure requirements in certain cases provided for by the listing directives. Clause 123(l)(c) gives them this discretion for international securities which are defined in Clause 45(6) as debt securities with foreign connection—for example, by their issue being a foreign company—and which are of a kind normally dealt in only by those expected to understand the risks involved. The Eurobond market is the prime example. Applying the full disclosure requirements to such issues is not necessary, and it would be damaging to UK markets. It could be desirable, for the future, to extend the discretion to domestic bond and note issues which, similarly, are bought or dealt in only by experts and professionals.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment because it would require consequential changes—for example, to clause 124(7)—for which my hon. Friends have not catered. However, I offer them sympathetic consideration with a view to tabling a set of appropriate amendments, so I hope that they will not press their amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was most helpful. In the light of my hon. and learned Friend's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 312, in page 94, line 40, leave out "entitled" and insert "bound". The amendment deals with a curiosity contained in clause 123. The Minister has explained that subsection (1) gives the stock exchange a discretion to authorise derogation between the listing particulars requirements. Subsection (3) provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State or the Treasury may issue a certificate to the effect that the disclosure of any information … would be contrary to the public interest".</p></blockquote>
Surely it follows from that that the stock exchange would be given not just the discretion but the obligation to take that into account. The purpose of the amendment is to replace what is essentially a power with a duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to bind the competent authority to accept the certificate, as the amendment requires. The competent authority will be bound to take the certificate into account and will have to have an excellent reason to disregard it. To enter the realms of speculation, if the authority were to disregard it and decline to authorise omission of the information, this does not mean the information would have to be revealed. In the final analysis, the issuer could decide not to proceed with the application, which would keep the information secret; alternatively, the issuer could seek judicial review of the refusal which, in the absence of a reason for rejecting the certificate, would almost certainly be granted.<br><br>
Indeed, it would arguably be inconsistent with the directives to bind the competent authority to accept the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
certificate. This would mean that the Secretary of State and Treasury had effectively taken over part of the proper functions of the competent authority. Article 7 of the listing particulars directive is quite clear that the discretion to authorise omissions should belong to the competent authority.<br><br>
Clause 123(3) as drafted is workable and poses no threat to national security. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong, but I thought that I detected less confidence than normal in the Minister in the correctness of what he had to say. Apart from stressing the difficult problem of having to comply with article 7 of the directive, the rest of what he said did not address the point, or at least provided an odd and circuitous justification for it.<br><br>
I understood the Minister to say that if the certificate were to be issued, as contemplated in subsection (3), there might be no problem if the stock exchange failed to act on it. The issuer could either decline to proceed or seek judicial review. Both seem difficult and unnecessarily complex routes. We could deal with the point more simply by making this minor amendment to the provision.<br><br>
The Minister may say that he had no option and that the drafting of the directive compelled him to put forward a provision in these peculiar terms. If so, one can only sympathise with him and re-emphasise the directive's limitation in relation to domestic matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by clause 123(l)(a) which connects up with clause 123(3). Subsection (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The competent authority may authorise the omission … (a) on the ground that its disclosure would be contrary to the public interest".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) then includes the role of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. But that seems to be without prejudice to the ability of the competent authority to determine what is and what is not in the public interest.<br><br>
I understand that that emanates from the European directive. However, different rules of administrative law apply in this country and in other European member states. I have a probing question. It is most unusual for a quango—or something along those lines, a competent authority authorised by statute—to be able to determine what is or is not in the public interest. Usually such matters are referred to the Secretary of State himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision emanates from the directive. We have incorporated it in the clause because it is in the directive.<br><br>
I sympathise with much of what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said about the quality of the directive, and I note with interest his enthusiastic nods at that proposition. It is a great pity that he did not draw his dissatisfaction to the attention of the Labour Government, which agreed to the directive on 5 March 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, my point was that the power to determine whether there should be an exception in the public interest has to be determined by somebody under the terms of the directive. I am simply addressing myself to whether it should be the competent authority

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
or the Secretary of State. However, I do not want to press the matter.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that there are many matters emanating from Brussels on which I would dearly like to have been able to persuade my colleagues—and, more latterly, his colleagues—that we ought to take a more robust line in pursuing our objectives. But I do not wish to pursue the matter, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that anxiety has been expressed at the vagueness of the opening words of clause 124, which are
<br><blockquote><p>"The person or persons responsible for the preparation of any listing particulars".</p></blockquote>
Those who have expressed that anxiety may have had in mind section 67 of The Companies Act 1985—a reasonably recent piece of legislation—which provides a rather more specific definition of those who would be responsible in such circumstances. The purpose of amendment No. 313 is simply to ask the Minister why he has drafted the clause this way, when a rather more detailed model was available to him in the 1985 statute.<br><br>
Amendment No. 314 is directed at subsection (6), which purports to exempt a person who is responsible for only part of the listing particulars from responsibility for the rest of the listing particulars, irrespective of their context. That context may be relevant to the person who is responsible for specific listing particulars. I believe that the provision is too widely drawn, and that an attempt ought to be made to limit the potential breadth of that exemption, which is what the amendment—no doubt, inexpertly—seeks to do.<br><br>
Amendment No. 315 relates to subsection (8) and is an attempt to shift the presumption in the present draft, which perhaps invites too ready a recognition of the lack of responsibility of an expert adviser. One ought perhaps to provide simply for the possibility that the giving of expert advice should not of itself mean that the person giving that advice is responsible. I invite the Minister to anticipate the extent of this provision, and to suggest how important he feels the potential exemption from responsibility to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) aim at a tighter definition of the persons liable, and my amendment No. 329 deals with the same problem rather more comprehensively.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to a printing error at the end of subsection (10) of amendment No. 329. No doubt every member of the Committee has read the amendment closely and has realised that the words "so rely" have been omitted from the end of that subsection.<br><br>
Clause 124 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"persons responsible for the preparation"</p></blockquote>
of the particulars. That seems to confuse the obligation of the persons involved in the preparation of the particulars with the obligations of those who have overall responsibility for them. It would be helpful to identify the persons who are liable to pay compensation and I am advised that that approach is consistent with our Community obligations. Furthermore, it would be helpful if certain defences were available to persons who might otherwise be liable.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 839</span>
Amendment No. 329 specifies the persons liable to pay compensation, including the issuer of the securities, any person who, in accordance with the listing rules gives a declaration that he is responsible for them, and any person on whose authority the particulars have been published. The amendment also requires that declarations of responsibility should be given by every director of the issuer and every person who authorises himself to be named as having agreed to have become a director of the issuer, although in the case of both directors and proposed directors the competent authority may grant dispensation.<br><br>
The amendment also provides that dispensations may be granted in relation to directors of international securities and to directors who, in the opinion of the competent authority, might find it unduly onerous or inappropriate to give a declaration. The amendment also make certain persons liable for part of the particulars, including any relevant third party, or the directors of that third party. The relevant third party could be the guarantor of the securities or any company into which the securities being issued are convertible.<br><br>
Directors of other companies, such as target companies in the case of documents issued by or with the agreement of that company in a takeover bid—that is a topical point—could also be required by the competent authority to give declarations of responsibility for the part of the particulars relating to their company. Furthermore, experts, which are defined in the amendment, will be liable in respect of their report, opinion or statement, to the extent that it is contained in the particulars.<br><br>
The defences in the amendment cover various categories of persons who could be liable for the particulars. They provide a defence where it is established that the claimant subscribed for or acquired the securities with knowledge of the misrepresentation. In addition, the amount recoverable is limited to the depreciation in value of the securities resulting from the misrepresentations. The amendment also proposes that a person who acquires securities in the after market more than three months after the publication of particulars must show that he bought the securities relying on the fact that the particulars were complete and accurate. He must satisfy the court that it was reasonble for him to rely on those particulars.<br><br>
Despite the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) I shall not go into more detail on the amendment as I trust that the Minister and his advisers will have studied it carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem raised by the amendments is one of degree rather than of principle. I accept that breaches of the specific disclosures required in listing particulars will often be innocuous and that there should be no right to compensation in such cases. It is also likely that if a breach of a specific disclosure requirement is material, it will amount to non-compliance with the clause 121 general duty and attract compensation on that account, but I am not persuaded that those considerations justify going as far as the amendments.<br><br>
First, the requirement that the purchaser should have suffered loss imports a materiality test, albeit one related to the recipient rather than the issuer, which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
should preclude claims based on technical breaches. The claimant would have to show that he had suffered loss as a result of the particular breach in question. Secondly, compliance with the clause 121 general duty depends very much on the particular circumstances, and one cannot assume that every significant failure to comply with a specific disclosure requirement would constitute non-compliance with clause 121. If the matter involved a clear breach of a specific requirement it does not seem reasonable that the complainant should have to show that it also breached a much more generally expressed one. Thirdly, whether or not a breach attracts liability to pay compensation in principle is only part of the picture. The defences must be taken into account as well.<br><br>
I am not persuaded that the matters to which my hon. Friends referred justify going as far as their amendments would require, but I have some sympathy with their arguments. I undertake to see to what extent we can meet them with a revised form of language.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked a specific question about advice. Clause 124(8) follows the standard provision in section 741(2) of the Companies Act 1985 and does not, as some have thought, cover a merchant bank giving advice, although it may be responsible for the details. I hope that that explanation answers the question of the hon. Member for Dagenham and that, in the light of my assurances, my hon. Friends will not press their amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have overlooked amendment No. 313 and not dealt with the ground that it covers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not certain that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) adverted to amendment No. 313. It is defective in that a person would have to fall into all four section 67(2) categories. He would have to be a director, named as a director, a promoter and an authoriser to be liable. I hope that that is sufficient reason why amendment No. 313 is unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did indeed advert in my opening remarks to amendment No. 313 in terms that the Minister has not yet dealt with. I freely concede that there is a drafting defect in the amendment, but I said that there was anxiety about the breadth and possible vagueness of the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"The person or persons responsible for the preparation of any listing particulars"</p></blockquote>
and so on. I asked why we could not use a formula such as that in the Companies Act 1985, which has the merit of being more specific and of identifying rather more closely those who might incur responsibility if they fell within the appropriate category.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman has pinpointed his concerns—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the Minister to get away with that. I repeated almost verbatim the words that I used earlier. The Minister must accept whatever responsibilty he cares to identify for not realising that I pinpointed as accurately on the first occasion what I sought to show on the second occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Now let us cut out the preliminaries and return to the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend is considering the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), will he tell us what conflict he envisages between the provisions in the clause, the proposals of my hon. Friend and the law of negligence? I am in some difficulty to understand the need for the provisions that my hon. Friend proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Dagen-ham (Mr. Gould) that I see no inconsistency between the concept of repetition and the concept of pinpointing. There is no objection in principle to the detailed specification of those whom the clause defines as
<br><blockquote><p>"The person or persons responsible for the preparation of any listing particulars"</p></blockquote>
and there is no fundamental difference over the persons to whom liability will normally attach.<br><br>
The amendments recognise that there is bound to be some doubt at the margin that can be resolved only case by case. That has long been the position under the Companies Act 1985 and under the listing regulations. Despite the peripheral doubts, it is common ground that other persons should, on the facts, share the liability which attaches beyond question to directors and to others obviously responsible.<br><br>
In reply to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), clause 124(9) preserves the common law, including negligence. For 100 years or more there has been express provision for liability in addition to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up the Minister's somewhat surprising invitation to me to repeat myself on every occasion. I ask the Minister to comment on another point that I assure him I pinpointed under amendment No. 314, about the liability of those who prepare only a part of the listing particulars.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is among the matters that we shall examine in the context of the worries that have been raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. and learned Friend the Minister is aware from an earlier debate, I am worried about the integrity of prospectuses for the purposes of listing, offers for sale, and takeover bids. I ask my hon. and learned Friend whether he is satisfied with the sanctions available to deal with false or misleading statements. I seek his assurance that he will adopt a tough approach to prosecuting those who cause losses for others by wilfully making false or misleading statements.<br><br>
The clause allows compensation for untrue or misleading listing particulars to be claimed through civil actions. I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend would confirm that compensation here amounts to the pecuniary loss that someone has suffered on buying the shares on the basis of statements of forecast
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
or fact and the loss incurred when he has to sell them thereafter. Can compensation amount to more than the pecuniary loss? Is an opportunity cost, for example, assessed in the compensation?<br><br>
Will compensation be given at the instigation of an aggrieved party or will it apply to all shareholders? If, for example, a grossly inaccurate profit forecast is given in a listing or an offer for sale and it is later found to have been intended to mislead, will only one shareholder be able to take action and get compensation or will all the shareholders be able to claim it?<br><br>
As my hon. and learned Friend the Minister mentioned, clause 44 has a sanction of up to seven years imprisonment and a fine for those who make false statements in prospectuses. Will he confirm that that sanction is in addition to the civil law liability in clause 124?<br><br>
There has been a spate of cases in which—although it would be a misuse of privilege to refer to particulars—grossly exaggerated forecasts of profits have led to substantial losses for many ordinary people and investors. In the light of those, I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will assure me, the Committee, and the public that he will promote deterrence and come down toughly on those who have misled the public and investors. Does he have any figures for the numbers of prosecutions and convictions of those who make wilfully misleading or untrue statements in prospectuses? Does he intend to tighten up the existing rules, and how willing are he and the other authorities to take action against miscreants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his responsible approach to this matter. If he knows of any cases that he considers worthy of investigation I should be grateful if he would draw them to the attention of my Department so that we can pursue them vigorously. I certainly intend taking action under the provisions of clause 44 to provide a deterrent for the future and a punishment for offences already committed. I assure my hon. Friend that such powers are in the Bill and we intend to use them.<br><br>
For civil liability the appropriate measure of loss will be the difference between the share price at any time as a consequence of a misleading corporate forecast or a misleading statement and the share price at the time of issue. I shall seek to table amendments to clarify that aspect. It is true that any shareholder who has suffered such a loss will be obliged to sue to recover compensation. But once the principle is established, those who wish to follow suit should not encounter any difficulties.</span></p>

ADVERTISEMENTS ETC. IN CONNECTION WITH LISTING APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 321, in page 96, line 33, leave out from "advertisement" to "unless" in line 35 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"which announces listing and indicates the essential characteristics of the securities or which is required under the listing rules for the purpose of obtaining listing".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
Clause 126 deals with
<br><blockquote><p>"Advertisements etc. in connection with listing applications."</p></blockquote>
I am worried about the "etc". I support the idea that when listing particulars are published in connection with an application for listing of securities, any investment advertisement should have to be cleared with the stock exchange. However, the stock exchange is understandably concerned that subsection (1) refers not only to
<br><blockquote><p>"any investment advertisement in connection with the application"</p></blockquote>
but to
<br><blockquote><p>"other information relating to the application".</p></blockquote>
That is widely drawn, and the stock exchange is worried that, as a result of the way in which the subsection is worded, there is a danger that the quotations department will be inundated by many documents that do not have a direct bearing on the application for listing. The department might be distracted from the major tasks involved in its function as competent authority. Therefore, the amendment seeks to confine the subsection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty with the amendment is that where it follows the directive it merely reproduces the obscurity of its wording without solving the problem. It does not follow the directive in one important respect, which is that the directive requires the submission to the competent authority of all documents relating to admission which are to be published by the issuer. The amendment fails to make such a requirement. Therefore, I cannot accept it.<br><br>
However, I am willing to look positively at this problem and to try to find some practical solution that will assist the stock exchange without creating difficulties for issuers. For instance, where material is put out through an authorised business, the issuer should not be in breach even if the material has not been submitted to the competent authority. Further, as in clause 141(1), an authorised person—whether acting on behalf of the issuer or not—should not commit a criminal offence but a regulatory breach. That solution would provide an appropriate way of dealing with what I accept is an ill-defined obligation but one where we are bound by our Community obligations. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not understand that, but it sounded helpful and sympathetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who has been taking such a great interest in our proceedings today, can explain in words that are intelligible to all of us exactly what the Minister has just said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the opportunity to hold forth at length to explain what the Minister said. It is unfortunate that when he cannot explain something adequately Opposition Members should have to do so. I detected a note of underlying hostility in the Minister's response to his hon. Friend's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby is always detecting notes of underlying hostility.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not in the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not in me, fortunately. The hon. Gentleman and I are great friends as we came into the House on the same day in 1977.<br><br>
I did have difficulty in taking in my hon. and learned Friend's response because of the speed with which he read it. Those outside will be able to see what is printed in <i>Hansard</i> and will find it helpful and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 96, line 35, leave out "the contents of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<p>No. 317, in page 96, line 36, leave out "have" and insert "has".</p>
<p>No. 318, in page 96, line 37, leave out from second "authority" to end of line 39 and insert "authorised publication.".</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 126 is drafted in rather surprising terms. As it stands, it may open up the possibility for unscrupulous people to represent themselves as having some sort of stock exchange backing for the advertisements and information they provide. I presume that that is not the Government's intention.<br><br>
The provision distinguishes between stock exchange approval of contents and stock exchange authorisation tout court. Is there not some danger in the concept of the stock exchange approving contents, as it might open up the way for those responsible for an issue and for the advertisement to be able to say that the stock exchange had approved them? Might not less sophisiticated, more naive, investors, think that the stock exchange if in some way guaranteeing the accuracy of the information, or giving approval to the issue involved? Will the Minister comment on this rather curious language, which might lead to difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I explain the reason for the twin-track procedure adopted in clause 126(1). It derives directly from article 22 of the listing particulars directive which requires documents relating to an application for listing to be submitted to the competent authority under the article. The authority then has discretion to decide whether to examine the documents before they are published. That does not apply to the listing particulars themselves which are required by clause 119, by virtue of article 6 of the directive, to be checked in any event.<br><br>
The reason for giving the competent authority the discretion I have just mentioned is that there may be documents which, because of the identity of the issuer or the nature of their contents, do not need detailed scrutiny. The approach adopted in the directives is to allow the competent authority to decide which documents to examine. There is no suggestion that the stock exchange will not use this discretion wisely, and there are benefits for both issuers and investors if the stock exchange does not have to devote resources to detailed examination of documents which do not warrant such attention. The amendments would not remove this discretion but would simply make it implicit rather than explicit.<br><br>
I hope that in the light of that explanation the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 845</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there is no difference between the Minister and the Opposition, but could he say something to remedy the genuine fear that underlies the amendment? I understand why the provision is drafted as it is, and I think that again we can jointly lay responsibility on the directive. Nevertheless, it may be feared that the clause will provide an opportunity for unscrupulous people to exploit the notion of stock exchange approval of the contents? How do the Government propose to avoid that problem? Would the Minister expect the stock exchange to object to an advertisement which said, "This advertisement has been scrutinised by the stock exchange, which has approved its contents in accordance with the Financial Services Act 1986"? It would be unfortunate if it were possible for such official approval to be incorporated into what is essentially an advertisement. Does the Minister not see that that is potentially dangerous?</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no way of avoiding the requirement for scrutiny, which emanates from the directive. We would expect the stock exchange to object to the use of its name in the manner suggested by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister finds himself in the dilemma which the amendment seeks to expose. I sympathise, as we are the victims of ill-drafted European legislation, and I would be only too glad to join him in objecting to the provisions. It would have been more appropriate if we could have legislated ourselves—in harmony and in consultation with our European partners—for our own conditions<br><br>
With that attempt to build a common platform, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 287. Subsection (2) refers to an
<br><blockquote><p>"advertisement or other information published outside the United Kingdom"</p></blockquote>
being
<br><blockquote><p>"available to persons in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
Clause 52, which deals with restrictions on advertising, contains a similar provision. The words of my amendment are part of the subsection in clause 52(3). Surely we should add these words here, both to be consistent and in order to ensure that the stock exchange is not overwhelmed with a flood of material with which it could not cope. They would be a helpful addition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is right in suggesting that the contents of clause 126(2) are wider than those of clause 53(3). That is because there are significant differences in the implications of the two provisions.<br><br>
An advertisement in a foreign newspaper circulating in the UK is treated for the purposes of clause 126 as if it is published in the UK, whereas it is treated as not being issued in the UK for the purposes of clause 52. This may, on the face of it, seem anomalous. But it is necessary to bear in mind the different circumstances of the publication of the advertisements in either case.<br><br>
A clause 52 advertisement in a foreign newspaper may consist of a foreign investment business authorised
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
under its domestic law, offering services to investors in its own country. It would be an unreasonable extension of UK regulation if the fact that the newspaper happens to be bought at a newsstand in the UK should mean that the business is at risk of contravening UK law if it is not authorised in the UK. In other words, the connection with the UK and UK investors is slight and fortuitous.<br><br>
A clause 126 advertisement, on the other hand, has a clear connection with an application for listing on the UK stock exchange. It would create a significnt loophole if foreign newspapers that circulated in this country could carry such advertisements without having to submit them to the UK competent authority. UK listing is clearly a matter for UK law. In those circumstances I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see that, clearly, there is a distinction between the two. I must refer back to the stock exchange to see how it responds to that, because it had not drawn my attention to that distinction. I do not wish to press the matter further at this stage and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

FEES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 320, in page 98, line 1, after "fees", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient to defray the costs involved.".</p></blockquote>
The clause gives the stock exchange the ability and the power to charge fees. I have no quarrel with that, but it means that an essentially private body has been given statutory authority to charge fees in this context. The oddity that the amendment seeks to correct is that no indication is given to suggest a limit on the size of the fees that the stock exchange may charge. No criterion is provided that is related to the functions that the stock exchange performs. The amendment seeks to make that connection and to authorise the stock exchange to raise fees sufficient to defray the expenses of carrying out its duties as the competent authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). When provision is made for fees, it is unusual not to include a restriction such as that which is reasonable, or related to overhead administration, and so on. It can cut both ways; on the one hand the stock exchange may find that it does not have enough to cover its requirements, and on the other it could drive people away if the amount were too great. I shall be grateful for my hon. and learned Friend's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the amendment is unhelpful for two main reasons. First, in any large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
organisation it can be very difficult in practice to arrive at a precise allocation of costs between various activities. Accountants may differ in the allocation of indirect costs so there may be a range of figures for the administration costs of listing.<br><br>
Secondly, even if it were possible to arrive at a single and universally accepted figure, why should listing fees not make a contribution to the financing of the expenses of, say, the trading floor? If the facilities of the trading floor attract investors and enhance liquidity, that benefits the listed companies and there is a no reason why they should not contribute to the the costs.<br><br>
I am not convinced of the usefulness or appropriateness of artificially constraining listing fees in the way proposed, nor am I aware of any groundswell of opinion from listed companies which are the entities directly affected. The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) introduces its own in-built deterrent to excessive fees. For those reasons I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess to being a little surprised at the line that the Minister has taken. My view is that practical problems exist in order to be resolved. I cannot believe that they cannot be resolved; an adequate agreement could be reached between the stock exchange and the Secretary of State on the appropriate costs to be defrayed by fee income.<br><br>
The Minister's more general remarks alarmed me. He seemed to say that he was giving the green light to the stock exchange to go ahead and to make profits in so far as it could, and to test the market. No doubt that is another element of free market economics.<br><br>
Those turning to the stock exchange, as they are obliged to do by statute, will be forced to decide in the market place whether they are prepared to put up with the unlimited fees which, under the provision, the stock exchange might wish to charge to subsidise its other activities. If they do not wish to pay that swollen fee, perhaps the Minister will say, "Their option is not to do it." That accords with the doctrine that the Minister seems to be embracing on this occasion, but it is a less than prudent provision to include in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister says that he is not aware of any ground-swell of opinion from issuing companies, but, with respect to him, one would not expect that now. There may be a groundswell of opinion if the stock exchange begins to charge high fees. When complaints are made, it will be precious little comfort to those with legitimate grounds for grievance to be directed to the provisions of clause 128 and told not only that the clause provides no safeguard, but that the Minister, in Committee, invited the stock exchange to go ahead and charge what the market would bear. Surely the Minister is not suggesting that we should pursue that approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just as the British Airports Authority had difficulties with the charging of landing fees, those people wishing to engage in the services of the stock exchange may find, if the fees are set too high after the big bang, that they will face a similar problem later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the hon. Gentleman's comments and make a further point, implicit in his comments, that it is surely in no one's interests and not the purpose of the Bill to deter people from coming to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
market with new issues. That would be an extraordinary outcome of the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course that point is right, and the stock exchange will bear it in mind in assessing the appropriate fee level. I did not say that companies should be deterred from coming to the stock market nor would that happen. I was simply praying in aid the remark of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) that that would be one of the many matter which the stock exchange must consider in determining assessment of its fees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, South and Shore ditch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I read in Saturday's <i>Financial Times</i> that th Minister was suffering from a crisis of identity, am that he had no political beliefs and could not decide whether he supported Iain Macleod or the Prime Minis ter. Iain Macleod would have found a rational solutioi to the problem, but the Minister is obviously going for the free, devil-take-the hindmost market. I hope that we can persuade him not to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am sad that the Minister seems to have resolved his doubts in that way, and, to m; surprise, the Committee may have to divide on the issue. The Minister might have said that he recognised the problem, and that a concept of reasonableness o another means of achieving a solution might have beei contemplated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the political consequences of the issue? Have there been any discussions? Can he carry the Cash?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to say that, given the brief period that we have had to realise that then will be a Division on the issue, we have not had thi opportunity of seeing whether the hon. Member fo Stafford would absent himself from Committee.<br><br>
A genuine matter of principle is involved here. I do not wish to detain the Committee, but, as we cannot leave the matter where it stands, we must proceed to a Division.</span></p>

QUESTIONS AS TO PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Questions proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I stress the importance of clause 130, which disapplies sections 4(2) and 4(3)(b) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 in relation to questions in connection with an application for listing?<br><br>
The stock exchange has sought for many years the exception from the Act granted in clause 130. The stock exchange considers the exception vital to ensure that any director on whom investors place reliance should be suitable to hold a position of trust.<br><br>
Where a company is applying for a listing or where a new director is appointed, each director is required to sign a declaration which includes a question about previous convictions which may be relevant in assessing whether he is suitable to be a director.<br><br>
If disclosure of previous convictions is made under the clause, the stock exchange will investigate the matter further to establish whether he would nevertheless be suitable to be engaged or concerned in the management of the affairs of a listed company.<br><br>
The stock exchange also keeps its own records which it will consult to establish whether an individual has been involved in undesirable activities, irrespective of whether they involve a conviction in a court of law. That may reveal reasons why an individual's past should be investigated further before the stock exchange is satisfied that he should be put in a position of trust with investors in managing a listed company.<br><br>
Where there is some question about an individual's suitability, the stock exchange will usually raise the matter with the chairman of the company and leave him to pursue the matter with the individual. The final conclusion may be that, despite what has gone before, the stock exchange is satisfied that the individual is suitable to be a director or it may decide that he should not hold office.<br><br>
The net provided by the procedure is vitally important to ensure that, for example, a person who has been convicted of fraud or of another offence under the Companies Act and who is likely to commit such an offence again, should not become a director of a listed company.<br><br>
Without the exception from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 the stock exchange may become aware of a conviction that has become spent but which still raises serious doubts about an individual's suitability to become a director, and there would be a conflict between the duties of the stock exchange to the investing public and its obligations under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1984 to perform a public duty, bona fide and without malice. The present system is thus contrary to the public interest and will be rectified by clause 130.<br><br>
The same process is used for directors of companies that propose to enter the unlisted securities market.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 850</span>
The exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 should extend to applications to join the USM. I ask my hon. and learned Friend why no similar provision appears in part V of the Bill. Earlier we discussed the "fit and proper" test and membership of SROs. Will we eventually achieve consistency between clause 130 and the earlier provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have noted carefully what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. He referred to the debate on clause 25, which deals with a similar provision. During that discussion I said that I would bring forward proposals to disapply the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 for some offences involving dishonesty and breaches of relevant legislation by senior managers of investment business. The implications for clause 130 go rather wide; they will have to be considered, and we shall give the most earnest attention to the points that my hon. Friend has raised.<br><br>
My hon. Friend asked why that concept is not applied in part V. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) made plain, the matter requires careful consideration. The extent of disapplication must be circumscribed, and it would not be right to extend it to the unlisted securities market, although we shall have another look at that in the light of the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is more important to extend the concept not only to the unlisted securities market—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That matter should be discussed at the appropriate time, not now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is not an appropriate time for it, as the matter is not dealt with in part V. That is the difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for bearing in mind what I said earlier.<br><br>
Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, after a term of imprisonment has been served it is not possible for someone to obtain or publish information about a conviction. The stock exchange or other competent authority may have good reason to make an exception and to elicit facts that it may take into account in deciding whether a share should be listed.<br><br>
However, I am worried that that exemption may allow the stock exchange to publish facts about people. There should be a distinction between reasonable inquiries, which the stock exchange should be able to make in deciding on the integrity of facts contained in a listing document, and the desirability—or undesirability, as I see it—of publishing details about people, which involves one of the basic tenets of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) for raising that point. We shall consider it carefully in deciding how best to formulate the disapplication of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 for clauses 25 and 130.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend accept that there is a difference between types of offences, and is that what he has in mind?</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ALTERATION OF COMPETENT AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 99, line 41, leave out paragraph (a) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) that the Council is exercising those functions in a manner which is unnecessary for the protection of investors and fails to take into account the proper interests of issuers and proposed issuers of securities; or".</p></blockquote>
I hope that you and my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) will forgive me if I take a little time to explain the significance of this important amendment, Sir Michael.<br><br>
Clause 131 confers the power to appoint a competent authority in place of the stock exchange and is a necessary part of the constitutional framework of part IV. The Secretary of State is unlikely to wish to appoint another competent authority, as the stock exchange has acted in an exemplary fashion over the years and has an enviable reputation throughout the world. However, since the implementation of the listing directives, it has been exercising a statutory function in regulating official stock exchange listing and accordingly exerting a statutory authority over companies which have had securities admitted and over those seeking admission. It would be wrong for it to have an unfettered power to impose statutory obligations on others, and clause 131 provides the necessary accountability.<br><br>
Subsection (1) specifies the circumstances in which the council of the stock exchange could be relieved of its responsibilities as competent authority. Subsection (l)(a) states that that could be done if it appears to the Secretary of State that the council no longer commands the confidence of issuers or proposed issuers.<br><br>
The stock exchange has represented that this wording could weaken its authority. Sometimes, in the interests of investors, it has to insist on conduct which is unpopular with issuers. An issuer could then complain to the Secretary of State that the stock exchange had forfeited its confidence. Under the clause as drafted, that would be grounds for dismissing the stock exchange. Although the Secretary of State would not be required to act, he would have to consider the complaint, and so the stock exchange's authority would be undermined to that extent.<br><br>
The amendment changes subsection (l)(a) so that the power of dismissal may be exercised only if it appears to the Secretary of State that the stock exchange is acting in a manner which is not necessary for investor protection and which does not take into account the proper interests of issuers and prospective issuers. That does not affect subsection (1)(6) which empowers the Secretary of State to act to protect investors.<br><br>
The new formulation will provide adequate accountability without weakening the stock exchange's authority and I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us whether he regards the charging of excessive fees as bringing the stock exchange within the provisions of the amended clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That matter would have to be considered carefully, taking into account all the circumstances relevant at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precious little comfort to the Committee, but at least it suggests that there is some limit to the Minister's preparedness to rely on the free market. I am glad to hear that he does have some concept of excess in relation to fees.</span></p>

PRELIMINARY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 330, in page 101, line 10, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"other than such investments as may be specified by an order made by the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment empowers the Secretary of State to limit the range of investments to which Part V of the Bill applies. At present, all securities not listed on the stock exchange are covered. They include shares in international companies which are listed on overseas exchanges and not in London; Eurobonds which are listed in Luxembourg or which are not listed at all; short-term financing instruments such as Euro commercial paper and certificates of deposit; securities dealt in on the stock exchange's unlisted securities market; securities on the over-the-counter market, and securities under the business expansion scheme.<br><br>
The title of part V—"Offers of Unlisted Securities"—could suggest that we are just talking about the unlisted securities market. But we are talking about a massive range of investments. The turnover on the Eurobond market far exceeds the turnover of all the investments that are covered by part IV. The damage that mistakes in part V could do to London as an international financial centre would be greater than any damage resulting from mistakes in part IV of the legislation. We must ensure that we get it right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend is saying, and I should like to give an example to show that part V does not deal only with the USA.<br><br>
In London last year, new issues on the domestic UK stock market raised £6,000 million, while new issues on the Eurobond market raised 150 billion US dollars, two thirds of which was raised in London.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his example.<br><br>
We must ensure that the clause, and this part of the Bill, do not impose an inflexible regime on the capital market of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Amendment no. 330 is a probing amendment. I want to ensure that the Secretary of State is able to exclude

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 853</span>
instruments which this section of the Bill should not cover, for example, money market instruments which I do not believe that we should cover in this way. I recognise that the Secretary of State has an exempting power in clause 140, but this additional power is necessary to ensure that London's capital market does not by mistake find itself at a material disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, my hon. Friend's amendment seeks to achieve a power to exempt various types of securities from the requirement of a prospectus. Such a power already exists in clause 2, and I therefore respectfully suggest to my hon. Friend that there is no need for the amendment.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) has just returned to the Committee, I propose to say no more and shall sit down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for reminding me of what is in clause 2, which we discussed so long ago that it slipped out of my mind. However, could the Minister at least indicate to the Committee that the Secretary of State would have it in mind to use that power where it appears that there are securities and instruments which would otherwise be covered by part V, and which, if part V were applied in its entirety to them, would be detrimental to the working of the London market? Obviously I would not expect my right honourable Friend to exercise the power if it appears that the interests of investors would be damaged, but I am worried about the market here. Investors themselves will benefit from a thriving, liquid market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the extent that the necessary steps cannot be taken under clause 140, to which my hon. Friend reverted, we shall certainly be ready to use clause 2 where appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the remarks of my hon. and learned Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p>No. 350, in clause 140, page 105, line 2, leave out "an advertisment" and insert "a prospectus".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The meaning in subsection (4) of an advertisement which offers securities seems to be extremely wide. It extends beyond the term "prospectus"; it could cover stockbrokers' letters offering telexes in Eurobond arrangements, even perhaps Reuters and Telerate screens. Amendment No. 331 proposes that there should be substituted the definition of prospectus that appears in the Companies Act 1985. It would catch any advertisement offering to the public for subscription or purchase any shares or debentures of a company.<br><br>
An example of the difficulties that could arise under clause 132 is given by the certificate of deposit issued by banks. They are negotiable instruments, issued by banks in bearer forms and provide a method for taking deposits which gives the depositor the ability to sell the instrument in the secondary market or to hold on to it until maturity.<br><br>
Banks do not advertise specific issues of certificates of deposit. A common procedure is that indications of the interest rates at which the bank might be willing to issue CDs are provided to Reuters and other screen services. In response to the rates posted on the screens, potential depositors ring the bank and if the two parties reach agreement a deal struck over the telephone. The certificate of deposit itself is issued on receipt of funds. It is not, however, clear from the Bill that the posting of indicative rates on screens does not constitute an advertisement within the meaning of clause 133. If it does not, it would be helpful if the matter could be clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say something about the other amendments in the group. Amendments Nos. 332 to 334 would limit clause 133 so that only prospectuses are required to be delivered for registration rather than advertisements offering security. Currently, clause 133 could require any document containing a secondary offering of securities to be registered and could even require brokers' circulars to be registered.<br><br>
Advertisements that do not amount to prospectuses would then be subject to the general restrictions in clause 52. As they would normally have to be issued by authorised persons, they would also be subject to any conduct of business rules imposed on such a person.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 345, 346, 348 and 350 are consequential amendments on the proposed change from advertisement to prospectus. Amendments Nos. 347 and 349 delete the limitations on the powers of the Secretary of State to make orders to disapply the obligation to register a prospectus in certain circumstances. Currently he may make exempting orders only if the advertisements satisfy the conditions in paragraphs <i>(a), (b)</i> or (c) of clause 140(1). Amendments Nos. 347 and 349 remove those conditions.<br><br>
The conditions are unsatisfactory in that they assume that it will always be possible to identify to whom the advertisements or propsectuses are issued. If the advertisements come into the hands of persons to whom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
they were not originally addressed, or into the hands of those who were not contemplated to receive them the exemptions may not apply. That could have extremely adverse consequences in relation to securities for sophisticated investors. For example, if a document offering a Eurobond were to get into the hands of Aunt Agatha and if Aunt Agatha decided that she simply had to have a particular Eurobond, that could cause the exemption to be lost. If there is a risk of such a loss, the international capital market may move away from London to a centre where there is greater certainty about the law.<br><br>
Furthermore, without knowing the detailed requirements of the proposed rules, it is difficult to know whether the Secretary of State's exempting powers will be wide enough to cover the needs of all the markets. I note that "Private character" has replaced "domestic concern", which is used in the Companies Act and has given rise to much discussion about its meaning. Does my hon. and learned Friend think that the new expression will give rise to less doubt than the previous one?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the last point raised by hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is undoubtedly yes.<br><br>
I understand that Aunt Agatha would appreciate a particularly full explanation of why I cannot accept the arguments of my hon. Friends and I hope that you, Sir Michael, and the Committee will bear with me if I give that full explanation.<br><br>
My hon. Friends are worried about these aspects of part V. The first is the abandonment of the concept of "offer to the public"; the second is that part V may apply to secondary offers; and the third is that it will apply to takeover offers. I shall deal with each of these in turn and explain our reasons for following the course that we have taken and why the fears expressed by my hon. Friend are not well-founded.<br><br>
The concept of an "offer to the public", which amendment No. 331 would reintroduce, is notoriously difficult. The case of Nash v. Lynde in 1929 established that even an offer to one person may be an offer to the public in certain circumstances. There have been many representations to us that the present law unduly restricts offers for which the full rigour of prospectus law would be inappropriate.<br><br>
The Bill does not altogether abadon the concept of "offer to the public". Instead, in clause 140(1) it approaches it from a different angle and provides for a power to make an order excluding categories of investments. In this way, the borderline between public offers, to which the stringent requirements of prospectus law properly apply, and other offers can be kept up to date in a flexible way to avoid some of the problems that have arisen.<br><br>
It is true that the instrument conferring these exemptions in question has not yet been drafted. I think that hon. Members would rightly criticise us if we were too hasty and did not give adequate time for consultation. But the broad shape of the exemptions will be clear from the clause. I can give the firmest possible undertaking that the draft instrument will be the subject of wide consultations and will be laid before Parliament and subject to parliamentary procedure as laid down in clause 140(4).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
The three areas where exemptions can be made are, first advertisements having a private character. This concept is the direct reflection of the "offer to the public" concept. The difference is that the statutory instrument will be able to specify what is covered and, if necessary, be updated to take account of changing circumstances.<br><br>
The second is advertisements where investment is only incidental. The most often quoted example is where tenants of flats are offered shares in a management company to run the block; but there are many others. Companies are frequently used as a convenient vehicle to run some enterprise without any profit-making intention, such as a club or school. This provision will allow shares in such a company to be offered even though those to whom the offer is made have not previously been associated.<br><br>
The third category is offers to professionals and other expert investors. There is already an exemption in section 79(2) of the Companies Act 1985 for offers of securities of foreign companies to professionals. It is on the basis of that provision that the Eurobond market is founded. But there is no equivalent exemption for unlisted domestic securities. That is an anomaly which the Bill will remedy and which the amendments would remove. Therefore, far from restricting the Eurobond market we are removing a restraint from it, and domestic companies will be able to tap it freely.<br><br>
Therefore, the choice before the Committee is between a notoriously difficult concept where, if people are getting it wrong, they are at serious risk of civil and criminal consequences and a more flexible scheme directed at the same basic purpose. The same step has been taken in other jurisdictions, notably Ontario, and I am sure it is the right one.<br><br>
The second aspect of Part V, to which my hon. Friends' amendments are directed, is whether a formal prospectus is required for a secondary offer. I have to say that I do not think that their amendments achieve their intention as the definition of prospectus in amendment No. 331 is taken out of its context in the Companies Act, and made to serve a different purpose. The definition includes the words "or purchase" which would cover a secondary offer. But, for the purposes of these remarks, I will assume that the apparent intention is achieved.<br><br>
Clearly, no system of prospectus law can exclude all secondary offers. It would be too easy to avoid, by allotting the shares to someone else on a private basis and his then selling them on. Section 58 of the Company Act 1985 is alert to this possibility, and any document used to sell on the shares is deemed to be a prospectus. But this approach has its own difficulties. In particular, it inhibits a United States style approach to distribution of securities down a chain of wholesalers and retailers. Under the present law each of them would be subject to prospectus liability. This rule also inhibits competitive tendering since the bank or tendering house putting forward a tender has to assume liability blind.<br><br>
I am not saying that everybody should adopt US practice, but if London is to continue in its pre-eminent position as a financial centre it has to be possible to adopt different selling methods. The Bill would enable that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 857</span>
The effect of part V is that a prospectus has to be filed on a first sale of the securities to which the exemptions I have just referred to do not apply. Thus, so long as sales are within the exemptions, for example, among professionals, no prospectus is required. And, more important, once a prospectus has been registered, that operates to "frank" those securities for future sales. On reflection, and following the very helpful consultations my officials have had with, in particular, representatives of the Law Society in their individual capacity, I think that certain refinements may be required. The cases that I have in mind are further issues of identical securities where accounts and regular information have been issued to keep the disclosure up to date, other shares not covered by the offer to which the original prospectus relates and shares which have been the subject of an offer in a foreign country with equivalent standards. I hope to bring forward amendments on these points on Report.<br><br>
However, subject to that, I believe that the concept is sound. I can assure the Committee that there is no reason to suppose it will affect the Eurobond market. For the reasons I have given, it is unlikely that issues of Eurobonds will be covered at all. But if there is a secondary offer, to persons other than professionals and experts, it will be the seller, not the original issuer, who is liable if there is a breach. So there is no reason to fear that issuers will be driven away. That is in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 858</span>
contrast to what happens at present under section 71 of the Companies Act applying section 58. Under that Act if there is inadvertently an offer to the public the original issuer may be liable.<br><br>
The third aspect is takeovers. Here I will admit that we are tightening up. At present, as a result of a 1956 case, takeover offer documents are regarded as outside the prospectus provisions. The White Paper was clear that that was an anomaly which would be remedied. But we are doing it in a way which gives maximum flexibility. All that is required is that a prospectus be delivered at some stage before the offer can be accepted. It will therefore be perfectly possible to put out a takeover offer quickly and follow it up with a prospectus later. Again, I can give the Committee the firmest assurance that there will be wide consultation on the draft statutory instrument. And the point I mentioned a few moments ago—that we were thinking of making provision for no prospectus to be required for securities which are uniform with those already in issue in appropriate cases—will assist still further.</span></p>
