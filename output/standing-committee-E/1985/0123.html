FUNCTIONS OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 24, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The Board of Governors of the Museum shall, in each year after the coming into effect of this Act report to the Corporation of the City of London and to the Secretary of State and the financing, activities and programmes of the Museum of London, and such report shall be laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote>
I wish to speak only briefly because the amendment speaks for itself. The amendment would ensure that board of governors gave a report to the Corporation of the City of London and to the Secretary of State and that the report was laid before Parliament. It is useful for Parliament to be made more aware of the work of museums but it is particularly useful for Parliament to be made aware of the work of the Museum of London, partly because of its importance but mainly because it will be unique in that half of the board of governors will have been appointed by the Government. If the number appointed by the Government were half plus one, it would be manifest that such a report should be laid before Parliament. However, even as it is, we believe that it is equally important to see how the museum's work is progressing.<br><br>
We have reservations because we have reached clause 2 without succeeding in getting written into the Bill some of the statutory duties that we wanted the museum to undertake. Therefore, Parliament should keep a watchful eye on the museum's progress. As the board will not be independent when half of it is financed by Government, we believe that a report should be laid before Parliament.<br><br>
The amendment speaks for itself. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views. Perhaps we should hear his answer first so that we know whether it is satisfactory to us. As always, we wish to make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>M. Jeremy Hanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I greatly sympathise with the amendment. It is extremely important for Parliament, the Corporation of the City of London and the public to know the activities and programmes and the cost of running this truly excellent museum. Unlike the GLC, which has made a speciality of putting out expensive booklets at public expense at every opportunity, I believe that an organisation such as the museum must pay regard to the purposes for which the money raised is meant to be spent.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
I believe that in effect the Museum of London is a charity. I am assured that although the museum is exempt from registration under the Charities Act 1960 by virtue of section 11 of the Museum of London Act 1965, it still has charitable status. Therefore, surely it would be more appropriate to treat the museum as charities are treated so that it should report at least once every three years, or more often if circumstances so dictate. For example, if the museum succeeds in obtaining outside funding those who provide the funds should be informed of the way in which their money is spent. It would be useful to everyone if my suggestion were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks (Newham, North-West)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present the director of the museum gives a regular report to the board of governors' meetings. The reports are comprehensive, but as the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said, they are not in the same league as some of the GLC's more glossy productions.<br><br>
While the reports would benefit from a little more professional presentation, they contain a great deal of information. They cover requests for loans from other institutions, which the board has to decide upon. They contain regular reports on educational activities at the museum and provide an analysis of school parties, talks and other events. Reports from the director also relate to specific projects and groups working within the museum.<br><br>
Detailed reports are published on the museum's environment and working conditions. Despite the fact that the museum is housed in a new building, there are some problems still. A report presented on 31 January regrettably records that between 9 am and 9.30 am on 5 December a serious water leak from a versa temp unit in the display galleries above the costume department resulted in water permeating through constructional cracks into the costume store. Among the items damaged was a cradle used by Princess Helena for her children, the Royal Exchange beadle's coat and a funeral pall of a porters' friendly society. Perhaps later today in the Chamber that funeral pall will be useful for at least one Minister, but unfortunately it was damaged in the Museum of London in early December.<br><br>
One report records, somewhat sadly, that the number of public visitors to the museum between 1982 and 1984 fell alarmingly. No doubt that will have concerned the governors at the time and they would have wanted to ask specific questions about mat. We would like to think that such questions can still be asked by elected representatives after a report has been submitted to those who are in a position to debate and make decisions.<br><br>
The City of London will continue to receive the reports that the director has submitted in the past to the City and to the GLC. But as the Government have now taken over half of the board of governors,, perhaps London Members of Parliament will be best able to view London as a whole. After the abolition of the GLC, I cannot think of any group which will be able to do that. We hope to have a chance of seeing an annual or a bi-annual report—as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0556">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
suggested by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes—by the director of the museum.<br><br>
I do not know what mechanism exists within the Office of Arts and Libraries or the Department of Education and Science. At present, the Department is responsible for appointing one-third of the governing body. I assume that the director's reports find their way into the Departments of State. I do not know who considers the reports or what comments are made upon them. I should like to know.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will incorporate the amendment into the Bill because it would give us the opportunity to look at the director's reports so that we can make our opinions known on behalf of London as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Richard Luce)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said, the amendment requires the board of governors to produce an annual report for the two funding authorities and for the report to be laid before Parliament. I have given thought to the amendment and I have listened to the views expressed by the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) and the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks).<br><br>
I have considerable sympathy for the principle behind the amendment. It is proper for the museum to account to the bodies that fund it and it is right that Parliament and the public should know how their money is spent.<br><br>
I stress that the Museum of London already publishes annual reports and accounts which are readily available. I have no doubt that it would continue to do so without any statutory obligation imposed upon it. In a sense the amendment seeks to impose a statutory duty on the board to do something which it is already willing to' do voluntarily.<br><br>
I have given thought to the issue and I was interested in the viewpoint expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes, and I think that we should now establish that some aspects of this should be enshrined in law. Therefore, I propose to come back to the House on Report with an amendment that will take into account the views expressed on this amendment.<br><br>
I have not finally reached a conclusion on the issue, but will tell the Committee what is on my mind at the moment. I shall bear in mind the fact that there are already various legislative measures which require museums such as the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum to report at least every three years. That is enshrined in the law.<br><br>
I want to establish, first, the principle and, secondly, consistency. Therefore, I undertake to come back on Report accepting the principle of this amendment, and to let the House know what I have in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will greatly appreciate the Minister's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
flexibility and willingness to reconsider the issue. He is to be congratulated at this stage, although we shall reserve our full congratulations and thanks until we know the precise nature of the changes on Report.<br><br>
Will the Minister consider one or two aspects in making up his mind how to enshrine the matter in an amendment on Report? The Minister talks about the principle and I believe that he accepts that if the Government take increased powers and responsibility together with increased Government expenditure—making up the Government's share of the GLC's lost funding will increase Government spending—there should be direct accountability to the Government. Therefore, as Government spending of taxpayers' money through Parliament is increased —an unusual situation for the Government—it is right for the House to scrutinise and question the Minister if there is a need. I hope that the Minister and all hon. Members will agree that that is the principle of accountability and responsibility about which we are talking.<br><br>
I can understand that the Minister has a problem with timing if other similar and, indeed, larger bodies lay a public report before the Government only once every three years. That news about the Victoria and Albert Museum came as a surprise to me, considering the museum's budget and the amount of public expenditure which is determined by the Government annually. That is inconsistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To clarify the point for the hon. Gentleman, those museums are required to produce a report at least every three years under the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether that is the typical time difference between their reports, because a museum as large as the Victoria and Albert, which receives so much Government expenditure and public concern, should report annually, no matter what the statutory responsibility is.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will set a precedent in terms of the Museum of London—smaller though it is—and recognise that, as he can vary the Government's involvement and expenditure annually, it is only right that he and the House are informed annually about the museum's needs, priorities, worries and the pressures on it so that he can be best advised. Surely, the purpose of the report is not only to inform the House and the public but to assist the Minister in determining his support. The report is more than a public relations exercise. Given that the Minister could vary his sums each year, it is only common sense that the report should be an annual one and that all hon. Members should have the opportunity to assess the museum's performance and needs each year.<br><br>
I do not believe that the Minister has anything to lose. Annual reports would not make his position weaker or more vulnerable. It would not be a dangerous precedent for the Government to set, nor would it require unnecessary bureaucracy expenditure and so on. As the Minister has fairly and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
generously acknowledged, the matter is of cross-party concern. Surely, it is also good practice and common sense that there should be accountability to the Government and accountability through the Government, to the House so that the public can be assured that its money is being spent properly and that the needs of the museum, and thus the needs of those who visit it, are being looked at annually and reviewed by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is one lesson that I have learnt in the House it is that one does not look a gift horse in the mouth. However, in Parliament one must first ascertain whether there are teeth in the gift horse's mouth. I hope that the amendment brought forward on Report will have some teeth.<br><br>
There is a new spirit of generosity in the Committee. One advantage of coming to what in other circumstances would be described as a deal is that it allows Conservative Back-Benchers to enter the discussion. Perhaps the chord which was struck on Tuesday at least has unlocked their lips. I thank the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have debated clauses 2 in patches. I do not wish to explore much more of its content but I have a few points to make which could be significant and I would be grateful if the Minister could reply to them this morning in so far as he can do so.<br><br>
The clause is in five distinct parts — a hybrid collection. The first part replaces section 3 of the existing Act. The second part adds the archaeological services which we debated at length last week. The third part adds an important power to the Secretary of State's powers and is in respect of consent for the disposal of property and laying down conditions. The fourth part is the substitution of a new section 8 of the existing Act. The fifth part is an addition to section 9 (1) of that Act.<br><br>
I make no complaint that the five parts are collected into one convenient clause as it is a neat procedural arrangement. However, without close study, the nature of each part is not immediately apparent. Therefore, I wish to take the Committee through each one in turn, point out what I see in them and ask the Minister to reply or comment.<br><br>
The first provision in the necessarily complex layout is headed—" General functions of Board "—and it replaces section 3 of the 1965 Act.<br><br>
Section 3 of the Act says:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Board shall have the general management and control of their collections, that it is to say the objects vested in them by virtue of the last foregoing section and any objects acquired by them under the provisions of this Act, and for that purpose shall, subject to the following provisions of this Act, have power to make rules for securing the due administration and preservation of their collections, to acquire, hold and manage land, and to do all such other things as appear to them necessary or expedient for the purpose of their functions."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
That section is replaced by subsections 3(1), (2) and (3) of this clause, the archaeological provision which we have already discussed.<br><br>
First, it appears that the power to make rules and
<br><blockquote><p>"to acquire, hold and manage land"</p></blockquote>
has disappeared. I distinguish between land and estate and property and the lawyers among us can tell us the difference. Will the Minister explain why that power has been removed and why he needs to recast the more general section 3 of the 1965 Act?<br><br>
The second functional part of clause 2 is the archaeological content, which is added to the new clause 3. The third element is contained in subsection (4), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall not acquire or dispose of any land or any estate or interest in land without the consent of the Secretary of State and the Corporation and such consent may be given subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State and the Corporation consider appropriate."</p></blockquote>
That is a new provision and, unless it appears in another Act, it is not at present imposed on the governing body.<br><br>
Irrespective of its merits the democratic element is being displaced and the number of nominees is becoming greater. The autocratic element— the power of the Secretary of State and of the Corporation of the City of London—is increased. Their powers over land are increased, an element which appears to be disappearing from section 3 of the 1965 Act.<br><br>
The Minister should tell us whether my exegesis is correct and why it is proposed. The nominees of the corporation and of the Government are being increased. Can they not be trusted to continue their work? Has the Minister some purpose in mind or, dare I say it, do other people somewhere else have some purpose in mind? Have they told the Minister, " We want these powers included."? I ask the Minister point blank whether the corporation asked for those powers. If so, was it a minuted committee decision—I use the word "minuted" advisedly—and at what level was the request authorised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And why was it not leaked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister was approached we should also know why he acceded to the request. It is no secret why he has increased his own powers and those of his political superior. He ought to tell us that also.<br><br>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy), whom I am glad to see here, for omitting the next element in my resume. Subsection 5 reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'London' includes all Greater London and the surrounding region."</p></blockquote>
No one would cavil at that subsection, and it is wholly welcome.<br><br>
The next element in this complex clause is the substitution of section 8. I ought to add, for the sake of completeness, that the existing Act gives the board
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
powers to acquire premises for the purpose of maintaining a collection. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Board may use any premises acquired by them in pursuance of section 4 (1) of this Act, to allow those premises to be used (whether in return for payment or not)."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the last phrase—
<br><blockquote><p>"for the holding of exhibitions and meetings, the showing of films and slides, the giving of musical performances and the holding of other events of an educational or cultural nature".</p></blockquote>
That is a wholly satisfactory provision which the Secretary of State is now asking us to delete in its entirety. I hope that those activities will be subsumed into the new paragraph 2(3)<i>(c),</i>
<br><blockquote><p>" by such other means as they consider appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Let us suppose that the governors did not think it appropriate to show a particular film, no one could go to them and say, " Hey, you are not fulfilling the scope of the Act" because the specific descriptions of what governors may do is limited by what they consider appropriate. A citizen of London cannot go to the governors now and say, " Look, the Act says that we can have film shows and so on " and they cannot say, " We do not consider them appropriate". At present, the citizen can reply, " But the Act says that you may".<br><br>
If, as the Minister wants, section 8 goes, it will not be open to any citizen to plead, because the answer will be, " We do not think that that activity is appropriate; good-bye son."<br><br>
I have been at the bottom of the heap as a teacher in a school, and you will excuse my uncharacteristic acerbity, Sir Anthony, when I speak of the activities of the Government. I have been in the House for 15 years, and also right at the bottom of the heap in the educational system of this country and I know what I am talking about.<br><br>
I shall revert in a more parliamentary vein to what the Minister wants to substitute for section 8. He wants to insert a clause which is wholly unrelated to the present section 8. He wants to say:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Board may use the premises known as the Museum of London for any educational or cultural purpose whether or not connected with the Board's functions under this Act."</p></blockquote>
"Whether or not" gives the board a wider, general permissive use which goes beyond its functions. I suppose that that is all right, but it means that all sorts of people can hire premises for all sorts of purposes unconnected with the statutory purposes of the Museum of London. Is that not so? Would either the Committee or the House wish to give the board quite such carte blanche? It seems to widen its powers considerably. I think " or not" is quite questionable.<br><br>
I have dealt only with the first paragraph of the new section. The second paragraph is even more controversial—the first is controversial enough, especially when one considers that the museum is in the City of London, where many balls and functions take place. Some of them are perfectly all right but others, particularly nowadays, raise some questions.<br><br>
New section 8(2) states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
<br><blockquote><p>" The Board may allow any premises occupied or managed by them to be used by outer persons (for payment or otherwise)"—</p></blockquote>
so it can be beyond the scope of the board's functions and of the Museum of London, and may be used free of charge—
<br><blockquote><p>"for purposes not connected with the Board's functions "—</p></blockquote>
that is specific—?
<br><blockquote><p>"under this Act if the Board are satisfied that to do so would not conflict with those functions."</p></blockquote>
We are therefore expanding its scope and discretion— which in normal circumstances, is fine—but we are now doing so well beyond the purposes for which the museum has been set up, and the House, and, indeed, the Government and the City corporation, are spending taxpayers' money.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) has pointed out an interesting case of the extension of taxpayers' contributions, but we have an even greater discretion on how they can be spent far outside the purposes and long title of the original Act. There is something very curious here.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Let me deal finally with new section 8(3), which concerns the end of section 9(1) of the Act, relating to the duties and appointment of a museum director, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be added ' and for the administration of any services provided by the Board in the exercise of their functions."</p></blockquote>
That is not very controversial; it simply makes it clear that administrative decisions can be made by the museum's director, accountable, no doubt, to the board. If it is more than that, I shall ask the Minister to reply.<br><br>
When I first read the clause, I did not expect that I would have to ask so many questions or that the interpolation of little bits and pieces and excisions from the existing Act would raise such fundamental points. The Committee will not wish to go into those in great detail today; indeed, I would not expect the Minister to do so, because, considering how busy he is, I do not know how far he has been able to address himself to those matters before I raised them.<br><br>
My comments related, quite properly, to the clause stand part debate, rather than to a substantive amendment, and were very much an initial series of probing questions to clarify the Government's purposes behind the changes in the existing Act. But I see no direct connection between those and the purposes of changing the nature of the governing board and its associated finance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) is entitled to raise questions about aspects of the clause in the stand part debate.<br><br>
In Committee debates on the Local Government Bill 1985, an undertaking was given that, when the Museum of London Bill was introduced, it would incorporate a statement of the museum's objectives. When the Government decided to introduce the Bill to deal, in particular, with planning problems, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
also decided that it would be sensible to take advantage of the occasion to clarify as much as possible the overall objectives of the Museum of London, looking to the future. As the hon. Gentleman said, the key feature of the statement in clause 2 is the reference to the Londonwide nature of the museum, and he did not appear to be probing that any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Previous discussions have covered that as well as possible. The statement in clause 2 clarifies the powers of the board of governors, including a clear recognition of the archaeological work throughout London co-ordinated by the museum. We have already debated that. The statement of the powers and objectives is comprehensive without being inflexible. It brings the legislation governing the Museum of London in line with other modern museum legislation. That is important. The hon. Gentleman raised one or two specific points and if my answers do not satisfy him entirely, I undertake to write to him as soon as possible with fuller details.<br><br>
He referred to the power to acquire and manage land and mentioned the 1965 Act. We are trying to rationalise and clarify the overall objectives of the museum. That power is subsumed in clause 2(2). I should make it clear that there is no loss of power to make rules and acquire land which can be done under clause 2(2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and understand his position, which I anticipated. I understand that that measure will be covered by subsection (2), but it is there by implication, whereas it is explicitly named in the existing Act. I should have thought that when changing legislation, if we remove words that appear in existing legislation, there must be a specific purpose for doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point and hope that our debate will clarify the position. We are trying to rationalise the law and bring it into line with laws that apply to other important museums. That means that specific points in previous legislation are dropped, but I hope that my clarification helps the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the description of the activities referred to in page 3 of the Bill which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Use of premises occupied or managed by the Board."</p></blockquote>
He drew attention to the description of cultural activities in section 8 of the 1965 Act. That is covered by clause 2(2). Again, there is no loss of power and no intention to change present practices. The provision is slightly wider than in the previous Act.<br><br>
Those powers have been given to other museums, such as the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museum. It is sensible to give some latitude to the trustees. We take great care in their appointment and they are people of the highest calibre. We must leave it to their discretion and good judgment about how the facilities provided by the museum
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
can be best used. We are trying to bring that into line with some of the provisions for other great museums.<br><br>
I shall try to clarify some of the hon. Gentleman's points further, perhaps by correspondence. I realise that there may be one or two other questions that I have not fully answered, so I shall correspond with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's offer which is very helpful. I hope that he will answer my questions about lines 1 to 6 on page 3 on the conditions that the Minister and the corporation have power to apply, and especially whether such powers were requested and under what genesis by the City corporation.</span></p>

FUNDING OF GREATER LONDON ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERVICE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reiterate the points raised about the funding of the archaeological service. We underline the problem that if the matter is left as discretionary, it will be seen as second best if the museum is faced with financial stringencies, as no doubt all the other will be. I believe that the insertion of the clause underlines the need to make the archaeological service a statutory duty rather than a discretionary one.<br><br>
The Minister may wish to comment on how he sees the clause operating. The Historic Bulidings and Monuments Commission for England is new and the Minister may wish to describe how he sees its future developing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has again raised the matter of discretionary powers. We had a full debate on the pros and cons and the Committee took a decision. Clause 4 is important. For the first time, there will be a specific statutory provision for funding the archaelogical service. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England is deeply involved in rescue archaeological work and has a wealth of experience and expertise on which to draw. The commission i6 firmly committed to funding that London-wide service, which it regards as an important task.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
The additional sum of money available because of abolition, is £7·75 million. The commission will undertake a range of tasks and it is determining a proportion of that sum to be allocated to the archaeological service. Those funds have been given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. The commission is committed to join the Museum of London in providing an important service and to continue with it on a London-wide basis. I hope that I have clarified matters for the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a further question. I am always intrigued by the phrase "Greater London and the surrounding region". We are discussing a body that will have a much wider United Kingdom responsibility, so how do we define " surrounding region "?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) raised that important point on Second Reading. During my discussions with the museum, I have been struck by the fact that it would be possible to have investigations into archaeological matters that overlapped with a neighbouring region. So it would be silly to restrict such investigations to the exact boundaries of the greater London area, given that an important research operation might flow over into an area just outside greater London. That is why we wanted to allow this latitude in the Bill.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EXPENSES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the clause. Obviously, the Government's share of funding will rise from one third to one half of the museum's costs. The way in which the budget is agreed at present necessitates agreement between all three parties. So the agreement tends to be made at the lowest common denominator. That has worked reasonably well, although no doubt the museum would have preferred more money. No one party could put in more money than the other two: there had to be agreement on the same level between all three.<br><br>
Will a similar operation take place between the Minister's Department and representatives of the City corporation? The problem is that the Government are forever trying—albeit not very successfully—to save money in the public sector. They do not succeed in saving much in areas such as defence, but they are better at saving money from grants, social services and other more worthy and justifiable areas of public expenditure.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
I believe that the Government are likely to put pressure on the City to force down the grant, with a resultant decline in the museum's income. What sort of assurance can the Minister give the Committee about future funding for the Museum of London? Projections for future years have been made, so will the Minister abide by those?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanky</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us his opinion of industrial and commercial sponsorship funding of such museums?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy for a museum or any arts institution to take capitalist money. Good capitalist gold is always welcome at County Hall to help us to fund various arts institutions and buildings throughout London.<br><br>
However, I should not like to see the Government hand over—or refuse to meet—their responsibilities for the funding of the arts, museums, art galleries and so on. The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) comes from the more progressive end of the Conservative spectrum, but on the neanderthal Right of his party there are people who would like to see the public purse completely closed to museums, art galleries, theatres, concert halls and so on. I can think of several hon. Members who regularly get up at Question Time to press the Minister to cut public funding for the arts to the bone.<br><br>
I know, of course, that this Minister will resist such requests; and the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes does not agree with them either. However, the danger exists. To- answer his question again, I am quite prepared to see museums and other arts institutions raising money from private sponsorship. The arts have relied on a mixed bag of funding throughout history.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are two crucial considerations to be borne in mind when taking what he described—in answer to the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley)—as capitalist gold for worthy projects such as this?<br><br>
The first is that such funding, particularly if it becomes part of the base budget of an organisation, may be diminished or withdrawn, thus threatening the stability of the organisation's finances. Secondly, any company putting a sizeable amount of money at the disposal of an arts institution may—not unreasonably—wish to impose conditions. Such conditions may be covert or overt.<br><br>
It would not be unreasonable, for example, for a large brewing firm that wished to give the museum £150,000 a year to be anxious to increase the museum's acquisitions from the history of brewing and to press for a better presentation of that history. The history of brewing is an interesting part of the industrial and social past of London, so the brewery's hopes would not be unreasonable.<br><br>
However, if such conditions became embedded in the money provided, the museum would soon find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
that its curatorship and its acquisitional and educational roles were being eroded and perverted: effective control would be taken away from the directorship of the museum.<br><br>
For those two reasonable, non-party political reasons, Opposition Members are always concerned about private money. There is a role for it, but it poses genuine problems. Would my hon. Friend agree with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would indeed. That is what I call an intervention. Anyone interested in the history of brewing would find some fertile research material walking around this House.<br><br>
Private money should be topping-up money; It should not call the tune. I believe that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes would agree with that.<br><br>
At the risk of apearing obtuse, I want to ask the Miinster to clarify once and for all the question of the increased contribution from the Government. We know that an extra £17 million has been allocated for mueums and art galleries in the wake of the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils. Will the Government's increased contribution come from that £17 million? We know that that money will taper off in due course and disappear. Will the Government's contribution to the mueum of London taper off too? I cannot believe that that is what the Minister intends, but an asurance would assuage some of the anxieties felt by Opposition Members and by the museum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) raised a number of questions related to the funding of the Museum of London. His first point was about the arrangements that have existed until now for the funding of the museum—the agreement between the three parties concerned that expires on 1 April. I confirm drat the nature of the arrangements that have existed hitherto will continue, but as between two partners—the City Corporation and the Government.<br><br>
The Government have made it clear that the total budget next year will be £4·5 million, which is a 10.5 per cent. increase on this financial year. That takes into account a number of important factors. The museum needs financial help for maintenance, refurbishment and for a number of other matters. This is a substantial increase.<br><br>
The Government have to provide half that money. We have already made it clear in public that we shall provide £2·25 million for that purpose. We are now waiting for the City corporation to confirm that it will match that figure. That is part of the nature of the arrangement that has worked hitherto. The Government suggest a figure; it is then discussed with the other funding authorities, and it is up to them to make their own decisions. I look with confidence to a budget that will be substantially increased.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the special sums of money made available for museums, as a result of abolition. The bulk of the money that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
Government provide comes from the ordinary funding process, but one part will be drawn out of the £17 million made available to deal with the problem that we have as a result of abolition. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will regard that as a reasonable way to deal with the problem.<br><br>
Most of the Government's funding for the Museum of London will come out of the ordinary funding process. I hope that our clear commitment for the Museum of London during the coming financial year shows the importance that the Government attach to the museum. We want its services to continue and expand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must follow up one point. I thank my hon. Friend for initiating the debate, but we must consider the taper that has not been mentioned. If the City corporation rejects the £2·5 million demand and is prepared to provide only £1 million, what will happen? Will the funding be mutually agreed between the two parties?<br><br>
As the Government are taking over responsibility for funding, the Museum of London will take on the characteristics of a national museum more than it has done hitherto when it was very much a locally-controlled museum because the GLC had a one-third share.<br><br>
Surely the Government have the prime responsibility to determine the level of funding. I cannot believe that the City of London should be allowed to exercise its prerogative. In other words, if the Government propose £2·5 million, I assume that the City of London, having accepted the duty of taking over half the funding, would have to respond in equal measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts his finger on an important point when he says that the museum will become more of a national museum. There will be a huge shift in potential veto powers and influence of any one partner in the funding arragnements.<br><br>
If one of the three partners was in a financially embarrassing situation, whether politically motivated or purely as a result of its own budget for that year, it could be pressured by the other two partners and would always, by definition, be outvoted. The difficulties or reluctance of one partner in the hitherto tripartite system would not be influential.<br><br>
We are now faced with the other extreme. It is not just a matter of losing one partner. One partner now appears to have veto if the other partner, either the Government or the City of London, says that it cannot match the figure put forward by the other side. I realise that it is difficult for the Minister to answer a hypothetical case, but all we are seeking is for him to recognise that there will be a change in the negotiations and agreements.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's proposal is not markedly different from the present situation. A veto already exists between the three parties because they always settle at the lowest offer. When three parties are involved, whichever is the meanest has to argue against the other two. The chances are that my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
hon. Friend is right. A sort of veto is involved, even in a tripartite discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting me straight on that point. However, while I am sure that he accepts that, in principle, a substantial change will not take place, in practice a tripartite system' can bring much more pressure on one partner in the agreement which is less willing.<br><br>
Opposition Members are extremely encouraged by the funds proposed by the Government this year. We note that with interest and approval. However, there will be other years and other financial circumstances, and the situation might change, in practice rather than in principle, which could cause difficulties in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that the arrangements for funding will not change, except that the sources of funds will be reduced from three to two. The basis on which decisions are made will not change. It is perfectly right to say that it is a matter for discussion between the funding authorities. The Government have made their position absolutely clear. For this coming financial year, we are prepared to contribute £2·25 million. We therefore look forward to a budget of £4·5 million. I can say with confidence that the City Corporation is likely to match our figure.<br><br>
I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman, but there will be no change on the previous position. The hon. Member for Newham, North-West was fair about that. On one previous occasion the GLC decided that it could not match the money that the Government were prepared to put forward. As a result, the budget was slightly lower than anticipated. That could happen, but I am confident about the coming financial year.</span></p>

FEES FOR ENTRY TO OR USE OF THE MUSEUM</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"(1) The Board shall ensure that no fee, whether voluntary or compulsory, shall be charged to any member of the public wishing to use the museum for the purpose of viewing the exhibits or for purposes of study or research.
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Subsection (1) above may be altered only by Statutory Instrument subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament".—[<i>Mr. Buchan.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
Our target here is the creeping commercialism in Britain and in particular in the museums and galleries which has originated from the ideology of the Government expressed most succinctly by the previous Minister for the Arts when he said that people should pay entrance fees because they would appreciate the museums and galleries better.<br><br>
We are anxious about the possible funding of the museum because over the last few years we have seen the squeeze that has been put on public support for the arts—that has happened despite the figures that are bandied about—which has forced museums and galleries into considering charges.<br><br>
We recognise that we are dealing with an illogical position because with two museums of a similar type, for example local authority museums, one will charge a fee and one will not.<br><br>
The division between charging and not charging has been pushed the wrong way: not towards opening up and freer access as was the intention when the British Museum first started in the 18th century. Bringing such an intrinsic service to people is now being seen as a source of revenue.<br><br>
I agree with those who have argued that the last point at which we should be charging people in education is at the point of contact when they enter. To introduce such a barrier is totally unjustified.<br><br>
The movement in the wrong direction to solve this illogicality came with the National Maritime Museum. About a year and a half ago writing in <i>The Observer</i> about the decision of that museum to introduce charges, Sir Roy Strong of the Victoria and Albert museum said that it was
<br><blockquote><p>"symptomatic not only of a change in public mood and ideology but also indicative of what is to come in the next few years."</p></blockquote>
That was written in 1984. The article continued:
<br><blockquote><p>" In its crudest sense it embodies a triumph of Thatcherite principles; that is you get what you pay for."</p></blockquote>
The man attacking the decision of the National Maritime Museum and deploring its crude Thatcherite principles, Sir Roy Strong, has now introduced charges to the Victoria and Albert Museum. Such is the speed of degeneration of principle in relation to free access.<br><br>
We know that the Victoria and Albert Museum would not have wanted to bring in charges if it did not face a squeeze because of its increasing costs and the decrease in public funding. Before I am told that there has been an 8 per cent, increase over the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
last seven years in real terms and so on, we should look at some of the other factors involved. For example, of it were not for Getty and Sainsbury our National Gallery, the cream of art exhibitions, would be in immense difficulties.<br><br>
The acquisition fund a year ago gave to the National Gallery the opportunity of purchasing over the whole year one quarter of the canvas of the last Turner which was sold. The Turner sold for £8 million with charges and the amount given to the National Gallery for its entire acquisition was just over £2 million. That is the sort of squeeze that the National Gallery faces for acquisition.<br><br>
The point about gallery charges is that they can be used for acquisition whereas other aspects of the gallery, such as maintenance through public funding, cannot be supported by the charges. That, and the squeeze, is forcing the galleries into making charges.<br><br>
We have heard the ideology expressed by the former Minister for the Arts and seen the practice of the Thatcherite Government. We have heard Sir Roy Strong deploring that and yet within a year and a half he has introduced charges.<br><br>
The people who have saved the honour of public service are the staff of the Victoria and Albert Museum who very nobly—it is not easy for staff to quarrel with their own director and board of trustees—maintained a picket outside the museum to say to people, " These charges are voluntary. Do not pay."<br><br>
The effect of charges whether compulsory or voluntary—we cover both in new clause 3—is to reduce the number of people who visit museums and galleries.<br><br>
We know that when charges are voluntary two cash desks are placed at the entrance. That entrance is narrow and people have to pass the cash desks. But the people who will walk in without paying to defend the principle of public service will be the more professionally concerned people—the middle class and Members of Parliament. We will say that we will not pay and enter as a matter of pride because it is manifest that we could afford to pay. However, the working man with two or three children taking the day off to come to London perhaps to visit the Science Museum, will drop into the Victoria and Albert Museum. He is the very person who will not want to say in front of the children, " No. we shall not pay" in case they feel that they have been singled out and he cannot pay.<br><br>
It will have cost that man quite a lot to come in from the more remote parts of London such as the East End and then on top of that he will have to pay the £2 voluntary charge at the museum.<br><br>
The Museum of London must remain the property of the people of London. It will be squeezed because we no longer have the presence of the GLC on the board of trustees to ensure that charges are not introduced.<br><br>
I am not merely postulating about what might happen. The figures booted around about the drop
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
in attendance at the Victoria and Albert Museum are considerable. A journalist told me this morning that he thought that it was about 50 per cent. I do not accept that and I do not think the staff will accept that, but certainly there has been a drop.<br><br>
Between 1973 and 1974 the Victoria and Albert Museum was compelled by the present Prime Minister, who was Secretary of State for Education at that time, and by permissive legislation to introduce a discretionary charge. I remember it well because I fought against it. When I and my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds) pressed her we were told that it was perfectly simple; they asked for guidance, she would give them guidance and they would be required to charge. Within two sentences, the right hon. Lady had changed a permissive attitude into a mandatory instruction, so they charged.<br><br>
Within the first three months of 1974 the attendance at the Victoria and Albert Museum dropped in successive months by 50 per cent. I know that people will tell the Minister that the statistics are wobbly because no one has an accurate account of how many people went before. But we know that the attendance dropped by between one third and 50 per cent, when charges were introduced.<br><br>
I have spoken to Dr. Cossons and he admits that a drop of about 10 per cent. has occurred at the National Maritime Museum. That is a special case because people set off to go' to the National Maritime Museum by boat or bus and do not just drop in because they happen to be visiting the sights of London such as the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and yet the drop was 10 per cent. for such a specialised museum.<br><br>
Dr. Cossons also said to me, and I want this on record because he has now become the director of the Science Museum, that it should not happen in south Kensington because casual drop-in visitors should be encouraged to visit the museum. However, the Victoria and Albert Museum in Kensington, which is next door to the Science Museum, has introduced charges and I fear that the Museum of London will also do so.<br><br>
The Museum of London is popular. The first Museum of London about which I can find a record goes back to 1695 when a man called Samuel Saltar opened his "Knackatory" in Chelsea to exhibit relics of the Sheba queen and the famed Bob Crusoe. Also on display was a mermaid the top half of which was almost certainly a monkey, the bottom half being a fish.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From that period onwards, the popular museum was underway. A century later a public museum, the British Museum, started, with its emphasis on freedom of access. We are now dealing with popular museum under a Government who believe that it is good for people to pay for things, a Government whose Prime Minister is the Minister who first forced charges on our national

museum. Moreover, it is a Government who are imposing a squeeze on public expenditure not just here, but in the whole area of social welfare provision to bring in tax cuts for the rich. That is why we have fears for the Museum of London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend see a conflict in positions? The Prime Minister goes on at great length about the virtues of Victorian values, yet it was the Victorians who conceived of the idea of free museums as a means of educating the people. It is a pity that this, one of the better Victorian values, is not espoused by the Prime Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is even older than that. I was saying how the British Museum started in the 18th century, but it is true that there was a great expansion thanks to Victorian philanthropy. Victorian philanthropy was centuries ahead of the present Government. Imagine what would happen if one wanted to set up a library now. It would be unthinkable for someone to stand up at a council meeting and say, "Let's spend some rates on putting up a building full of books to lend to people free of charge."<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) is a member of the Committee. If Shakespeare had not existed the town council in Stratford would have had to invent him. About £20 million of tourist money comes to Stratford as a result. Yet the hon. Member says that he is fed up with the pressure groups demanding expenditure. He says that we are being pushed on all sides by demands for the keeping open of an uneconomic pit here and uneconomic maternity home there. It would help if he explained what an economic maternity home was. Is it one where they flog off the foetuses or barter the babies? However that is what the hon. Member said. He wants an end to all subsidies whether in the coal industry, in the museums or in the arts.</span></p>

Gentleman's remarks are distasteful and disingenuous as he is well aware. We have had interchanges on this subject before. He knows very well that I would like an increasing proportion of funding for the arts coming by way of tax deductibility and tax relief on donations to the arts so that it will be necessary to provide a smaller proportion through direct grants. That is my argument and the hon. Gentleman is well aware of it.<br><br>
Regarding uneconomic maternity homes as the hon. Gentleman terms them, perhaps he will recognise that from time to time there have to be changes in the pattern of social services provision in this country. If we are to make resources available for the urgent needs of, for example, the old, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill, as the South Warwickshire district health authority has sought to do, it may be necessary to close down particular maternity units that are used to perhaps only one third of their capacity. I find the hon. Gentleman's attempt to attribute to me suggestions of an obscene nature extraordinarily distasteful and I hope that he will withdraw them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not attributing to the hon. Gentleman suggestions of an obscene nature I am saying that he is so involved in the commercialism that he does not see the obscene position to which that attitude leads. That is what I am stressing.<br><br>
There is at present a conscious decision to cut support for arts. We see the decline in the postulated figures for the year ahead. If we include £9 million of capital expenditure there is a £19 million shortfall in the replacement money, following the malicious abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan counties.<br><br>
I rather like the Minister; he is a good guy. Like the traveller on the road to wherever it was, the Minister is a good man who has fallen among thieves. In such a squeeze, a popular museum, which is based on the history and lives of the people of London and was created for the people of London and the surrounding region will be compelled to introduce charges because of the Government's half share.<br><br>
This is a matter of national policy. The Government have now taken a half share of the control. The trustees should not be given the right to bring in charges, voluntary or compulsory, without the will of the House expressed in an affirmative order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) has made a good case in moving the new clause. He is noted for being a great champion of the principle of free admission to museums. My hon. Friends and some Conservative Members believe in that principle, too.<br><br>
There is a correlation between admission charges, whether they be voluntary or compulsory, and declining attendances in museums. That correlation cannot be denied because the figures prove it. Anyone who is interested in ensuring that as many people as possible have the opportunity to go to museums and art galleries must surely be worried about the decline that follows any suggestion of imposing voluntary or compulsory charges.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) made a contribution to the debate. Clearly he felt that he had been impugned by what my hon. Friend had said. The hon. Gentleman said that he would prefer a switch towards contributions to arts institutions being tax deductable. I would not necessarily argue against that, provided that it did not become a substitute for public funding. I am all for topping up and I am prepared to accept whatever devices are used for that purpose, but the idea that, by virtue of tax deduction someone, or a business can give to the arts money that does not constitute a charge on the overall public, is fallacious. It means that the great body of taxpayers are deprived and that the Government are deprived or revenue not received through income tax.<br><br>
I suppose that it could be argued that if the Government were tapering off at one end their contributions centrally and at the other end were getting taxpayers to pay through reductions in their own tax
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
burdens, there would be an equalising impact, but it never goes in such equal proportions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South said that once that process starts the Government will try continually to duck their responsibilties and will impose increasing burdens on those who are prepared to use devices such as tax deduction to support the arts. It is a slippery slope, and, although I am prepared to explore various ways of topping up, I am very conscious of the dangers involved in the arguments of the hon. Member for Straftord-on-Avon.<br><br>
My second objection, to which the hon. Gentleman will no doubt wish to reply, is that those who pay often require more for their money in terms of policies and influencing what goes on. The trouble with Governments is that they are largely disinterested: disinterested, that is, in the proper sense of the word. But individuals and companies can get very close to the bodies that they fund, either through direct grants or—if the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon has his way—through tax deductions. They can have an impact on the policies of those institutions. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) gave an an example earlier. He mentioned the brewers wanting to influence policies in the Museum of London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A hypothetical example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hypothetical, yes. But it is certainly true that most of the arts funding that comes from the private sector—industry and commerce— tends to be channelled into the safe parts. Very little goes to the new, the avant-garde.<br><br>
The point about the arts and all that is associated with them is that we must always be building on what we have. We must always be ready to hand something on to a future generation. We cannot live off Shakespeare for ever; although we shall probably never find one, we must always be prepared to encourage the emergence of a new Shakespeare.<br><br>
However, as long as Metal Box, Unilever, ICI and the Midland bank are putting money in—or using it to reduce their tax burdens—they will go for the safe areas of creativity. That is another inherent danger in the proposals of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon and his hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind my hon. Friend of what was said at the major conference on sponsorship for the Tate gallery last year? The spokesman for the firms providing sponsorship was as Mr. Joll, who represented a multinational complex. He said, "Of course we prefer to support exhibitions with which we feel comfortable." That was a beautiful giveaway word. They do not support the evangelists; above all, they do not support this Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite natural. A board of directors can be criticised by their shareholders. Their reasons for giving money to sponsor concerts or plays are not entirely altruistic; in return, they will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
require the best seats in the house. They will give those seats to their clients and claim tax relief " for entertainment purposes". There is no such thing as a free lunch—either in this House, where we specialise in them, or in the arts world. There is always a price to be paid somewhere. And the Opposition intend to look very carefully at the price that must be paid for the proposed tax deduction and increased sponsorship of the arts by private business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that there is more agreement between the hon. Gentleman and myself on that important subject than he supposes. My objective is more funding for the arts. I am not arguing that we should taper off existing funding or reduce it in real terms; I am arguing that we should provide fiscal encouragement for individuals and corporations to give more to the arts.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there may be a price to be paid, but I think that he is unduly sceptical about private patronage. I disagree with his view, and that of the hon. Member for Paisley, South, that private patronage is necessarily cautious, conservative and unimaginative. The hon. Gentleman talked about banks. We have a splendid precedent in the form of the Medici family, who could hardly be accused of not having been innovative patrons. Similarly, companies such as IBM are hardly reactionary or unimaginative in the artistic projects and activities that they sponsor.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The whole history of patronage demonstrates that close relationships between patron and artist tend to be fertile and creative. The artist needs appreciation. He needs to communicate. That is what art is about, and it becomes meaningless if there is no appreciation. Therefore, we should do what we can to foster a close relationship between artists and their individual patrons and the wider public.<br><br>
A further important advantage of private patronage is that it would take the whole question of the funding of the arts out of politics, although the hon. Gentleman may not consider the depoliticisation of the arts as desirable as I do. If a larger proportion of arts funding comes from private sources, it will become less necessary and less reasonable for the beneficiaries of public grants to continue to lambast the Government for their prodigious meanness.<br><br>
Admittedly, their criticism is largely tongue in cheek, but they have to adopt that posture in their lobbying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, interventions should be relatively brief, and secondly, we are debating admission charges, not the sponsorship of the arts. I should be grateful if hon. Members would address themselves to the question under debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Anthony. While I do, of course, accept what you say, I believe that there is a link between the two. I agree that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
debate is becoming broader and more interesting; perhaps we could find another opportunity to discuss the philosophy behind the different attitudes that are being expressed. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) is completely wrong to say that we talk about Government meanness in arts funding tongue in cheek. We do not. We mean it very genuinely. A Government who can find so much for weapons of death and destruction and so little for the arts have to be described as mean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. In discussing Government defence policies, the hon. Gentleman is straying even further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can never resist a closed door, Sir Anthony.<br><br>
It is impossible to take arts funding out of politics. Nothing can be taken out of politics because everything that we do makes contact with a political decision at some point, and decisions about the amount of money provided for the arts is essentially a political decision made by a Minister after discussion with his colleagues.<br><br>
Similarly, decisions about appointments to the Arts Council or to the Museum of London board are political decisions, because they are made by the Minister. I do not think that the Minister will try to maintain that he is above politics or as apolitical.<br><br>
It is remarkable how so many hon. Members, who presumably come to the House for political reasons, want to take so much out of the realm of politics. That cannot be done, and if people think that it can, they are deluding themselves.<br><br>
May I now return to the new clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are worried because we believe that the public already pay for museums in rates and taxes. They should not have to pay—either voluntarily through some form of moral blackmail or compulsorily. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) has already mentioned the Victoria and Albert Museum, and I know that that debate will continue for some time. The actions of the Victoria and Albert museum have shown the need for a protective clause such as this in any legislation affecting the Museum of London, It is in special need of protection because if all museums were funded by entrance fees, the Museum of London would suffer from competition from better known museums such as the Victoria and Albert museum and the National Portrait gallery, which would gain increased revenue from tourism.<br><br>
The location of museums should also be considered. The corny old story about the Barbican is that one first has to find it and then find one's way out. However, because of the excellent concerts given there by the London Symphony Orchestra, there is no great incentive to find one's way out quickly. There are many people wandering around
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
there, some of whom have doubtless been there since the centre opened.<br><br>
The Museum of London shares that problem. It has suffered from declining attendance and any form of charge would only accentuate that problem. It is a social history museum and it needs to be able to purchase items of interest as they become available. It is unique in that it provides education and study facilities for people with an interest in the social history of the area. It would be a great loss to the education services of London if the museum were to charge those people for study facilities or if it were unable to purchase the items necessary to ensure that it had the widest range of social history exhibits, and that some items were not lost altogether.<br><br>
When the Government controlled only one-third of the museum's decision making, so long as the GLC and the City could reach broad agreement on the level of the museum's funding, the Government could not impose national cost-cutting policies on it. I am more assured by what the Minister has said in previous debates and I accept his points. However, great pressure is building up in his party for funding raised through charges to museums and art galleries.<br><br>
There is permissive legislation now, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said it could easily be changed into mandatory legislation. Many Conservative Members would want that. It would be deleterious for museums and art galleries generally, but it would be especially bad for the Museum of London, for the reasons that I have mentioned.<br><br>
Newspaper reports on the Victoria and Albert fiasco show that when a museum's directors feel that financial pressures have driven them to charge admission, on either a compulsory or voluntary basis, it is almost inevitably the beginning of the decline in the museum's fortunes. The Victoria and Albert's attendance figures have gone down since the introduction of voluntary charges, although we do not yet know to what extent. We must accept the correlation between that and the charges. I object to voluntary charges. They are a form of moral blackmail and they create first and second-class visitors to the museum. That is bad for the museum and for its visitors.<br><br>
We moved the new clause because we could detect pressures building up within the Goverment to impose charges and we wished to protect at least one museum against them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important new clause. There is a fundamental misconception in the minds of some Government Back Benchers and I hope that it is not shared by the Minister or his advisers. It is held that admission charges are a purely financial matter and that they are neutral of any other implications about policy, direction or ethos.<br><br>
There is a temptation for Conservative Members to say, "It's purely a matter of finance. If extra money is needed, surely there is nothing wrong in those who benefit from and enjoy the museum contributing towards its costs." On that basis, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
Victoria and Albert museum introduced voluntary charges. Many members of the public and Conservative Members subscribe to that view. They believe that it is an economic issue with no wider implications. That view is fundamentally wrong and I hope that the Minister will recognise its serious flaw.<br><br>
Once admission charges are introduced, there is inevitably an absolute necessity to maintain the highest possible level of admissions. That is the ambition of any organisation but it should be only one of many ambitions.<br><br>
A museum's responsibility to attract the public exists alongside its other responsibilities to subject matter, curation, presentation and education. I do not underestimate or diminish the necessity to attract the public but that is only one of several obligations. When a museum elevates it to a concern of paramount importance by linking the budget more strongly to the attraction of visitors, policy is inevitably influenced.<br><br>
If four times more Japanese tourists than British schoolchildren visited the museum, and everyone paid admission charges, the museum could be seen to appeal to foreign tourists and its directorship would be justified in spending more money on foreign translations and audio translation systems. Foreign tourists would be in the majority and schoolchildren would have to take second place. There is an understandable tendency to spend money on facilities for the main body of visitors.<br><br>
Similarly, if research showed that foreign tourists were interested in a particular element of the museum, the directorship would be justified in saying, "We should develop this side of the museum. Education, curating and archives are manifestly less attractive. They account for far less of our income and so must take second place."<br><br>
I do not wish to labour the point but I hope that Conservative Members understand that admission charges are not policy neutral. Indeed, they exert a negative influence. For instance, the absence of income from schools might encourage the directorship to withdraw personnel for and investment on facilities for children.<br><br>
I fear that as long as the Government are in power admission charges will remain a concern at the Minister's Department. He will be pressed by Conservative Members and by those in the arts to consider admission charges for many institutions. I hope that he will recognise that we oppose admission charges for institutions with widespread responsibilities because attracting the public is only one of many competing priorities.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister recognises that it is not purely a party-political difference. There are genuine fears that admission charges are not neutral but have policy implications that can be dangerous.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, Northwest (Mr Banks) referred to the decline in admissions to the Victoria and Albert museum. That is a separate issue and should not be confused with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
this one. Sometimes admissions might not be affected when admission charges are introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Buckan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may not have happened, but it could. Clearly, it does with some exhibitions. The demands of an exhibition are fundamentally different and should not be used as an argument in this instance. An exhibition has only one responsibility —to attract people to view it. If the exhibition on Reynolds' work, for example, also had the responsibility of maintaining, conserving, cleaning, publicising and promoting the excellence of Reynolds as a colourist and social critic, admission charges would become much less viable and much less justifiable.<br><br>
There is a fundamental difference between specific activities such as an exhibition or the performance of a play and the much more general responsibility of a museum or similar body. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will consider the arguments. He will continue to be under pressure about admission charges. I hope that I have established a strong argument in support of the contention that admissions are not policy neutral. A clear answer is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposed new clause would prohibit the board of governors from making a charge —either an entrance fee or a voluntary contribution —to members of the public visiting the museum or using it for study or research.<br><br>
I have listened with great interest to the debate. Especially interesting were the exchanges between my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) and Opposition Members. There is something strange about this and previous debates on the subject. In particular, the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) always seems to have views that can be described only as being ossified by ideology which closes his mind to possible new openings for expanding the services that so many people, including the hon. Gentleman, wish to be expanded in museums and galleries.<br><br>
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) was using practical arguments rather than ideological ones when discussing whether the introduction of voluntary charges or the imposition of admission charges achieved a museum's objectives and purposes. It could be said that that argument was slightly different. Nevertheless, the ossification by ideology of the hon. Member for Paisley, South means that he has a completely negative hang-up about the issue which is difficult to understand.<br><br>
Many other countries have a clear policy. The United States is not the only one that I have in mind. For example, France gives a large amount of taxpayers' money to museums, galleries and other arts institutions. Such countries do not have hangups about the imposition of charges if they believe that it could improve their services. That applies in many parts of the world.<br><br>
A much more limited question is being asked in this debate. It is whether the trustees of the Museum of London should have the discretion to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
charge fees. Should the trustees be given the freedom to decide whether voluntary or compulsory charges should be introduced? It is not the Government's policy to impose mandatory charges across the board. We believe that it is right to leave charges to the discretion of the trustees. They have responsibility for their institutions—the Museum of London for example—and they should have the freedom to decide whether in the circumstances of their museums it would be right or wrong to introduce charges.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman appears to seek to deny the trustees freedom to decide what policy is in the interests of the museum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's reply, although I agree with the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West. (Mr. Banks).<br><br>
"Conditions" were mentioned in connection with both the corporation and the Minister. Those conditions could be used for bargaining. Current affairs have shown us that it is possible to link one issue with another. The Minister could say, " I will not allow you to do that unless you charge." New clause 3 is a protecting clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause has given me an important opportunity to make it clear that the funding policy of the Government, which has a strong bearing on the clause, is to undertake the basic core funding for museums and galleries. We shall continue that policy, which was in our manifesto, and we undertake to maintain our support. Having listened to the contributions from the Opposition on arts budgets, one might think that we had lived in different worlds over the past few years. There has been a real increase in resources for the arts. That is more than our commitment to the arts world in our manifesto.<br><br>
We have also made a substantial commitment to museums and galleries over the past six years for maintenance and refurbishment.<br><br>
I appreciate that we have not given such substantial increases in purchase grants to museums and galleries as we have for running costs and maintenance. That is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to maintain support, on behalf of the taxpayer, to our great national institutions.<br><br>
I should have thought that this morning's debate on the Government's decision on the money that we will allocate to the Museum of London gave a clear sign of our positive commitment. However, we are interested in giving to the trustees of our great national institutions freedom to decide for themselves whether to impose the charges, and whether that improves their facilities. That is a clear, basic funding commitment, and it will not change, whether or not the museum introduces voluntary or admission charges.<br><br>
I am considering that if we hit museums in terms of funding because they decided to introduce charges, it would be a grave disincentive to any museum to increase revenues.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
This debate is about whether we give autonomy and freedom to the trustees to decide what they think is in the real interests of their own museums. If the new clause were accepted, it would deny them that freedom and the opportunity, if they wished to take it, to improve the facilities of the museums, and that is what interests the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we have one more important new clause to debate.<br><br>
I shall not pretend that I am not disappointed by the Minister's answer. He goes through a familiar declension. "We are practical; he is ossified; you are political"—and the last is worst of all in his calendar. But we are not political. On the contrary, we are dealing with a broad aspect of public service, with vast implications for education, and social problems and so on.<br><br>
I am disappointed, not because I expected the Minister to accept the new clause, which contains a flaw that I shall discuss shortly, but because he has left the door open for the introduction of charges.<br><br>
The Minister says, "There is no question of our reneging on our commitment to funding if charges are brought in. We would not make a trade-off by saying, ' Good—we encourage you to bring in charges, because that will reduce the funding.'" He says that the Government have a commitment to funding. But that is not true. The Government's only commitment is to provide half the funding, and for all we know it works out at 10 bob each.<br><br>
I cannot believe that the Treasury, especially under the present Government, would see that, say, the Museum of London was receiving a healthy income from charges and say, " We'll give more funding." It would say, " They are doing well; we must give them less "—and, if it did not, the City of London would. It would say, " It is exactly in line with our unossified view that people should be charged."<br><br>
There is no funding commitment. There is merely a formula. A commitment would exist if the Government said that funding would not decline, but would increase—if they guaranteed at least a 3 per cent, increase each year. But to provide half the funding is not a commitment.<br><br>
I recognise, Sir Anthony, that you are concerned about the spread of this debate. However, my remarks are related to the problems of sponsorship and private support, to the Government's concept of how much should be public and to their encouragement for private sponsorship. Let me say in passing that I am not opposed to private sponsorship; but it cannot be a substitute for public sponsorship. We must take care that it does not begin to impose its pattern. I cannot tolerate, for example, the suggestion that cigarettes should be used as a means of sponsorship. That strikes me as an unqualified evil. But I believe that Conservative Members would allow it in the name of freedom. They argue that we must give freedom to the trustees.<br><br>
I do not understand that. We do not give freedom to a local education authority to shut 90 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
of its schools and stop educating children when they are 10. We say, "You shall educate children up to the age of 16, and we shall ensure that you do so by imposing legislation, plus an inspectorate."<br><br>
The Opposition do not accept that the principle of funding is a matter to be decided at the discretion of trustees. I am quite firm about that. The Minister said that we were denying freedom to the trustees, but I am also concerned with the freedom of access of those who wish to use the museum. In our view, the freedom of trustees, if applied in this way, is a denial of freedom to those for whom the building was constructed and whom the taxpayer is funding.<br><br>
However, I make on exception, which I should have taken on board in the amendment. It is a technical point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). In our view, there is a crucial difference when a specific exhibition has been mounted which the museum could not otherwise afford—exhibitions of Chinese ceramics or Japanese kimonos, or the marvellous exhibitions that we have seen at the Royal Academy and the V and A in recent years:. We would like to make those free, but we realise that we cannot. It is illogical, but it is an illogicality of pragmatism and sense and totally non-political.<br><br>
Although I am strongly opposed to the arguments against the new clause, I shall withdraw it so that I can clarify it by including an exception in the case of exhibitions and bring it back on Report. I believe that this is a matter of public concern.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

We are concerned—as is the Society of Archivists —that the history of London should be properly preserved. Both archivists and the Library Association are worried about what will happen to the records of the GLC and previous London governments. We must safeguard them, because this has been a very exciting period in local government. Even if it did not have the distinctive pattern that everyone associates with the best elements of the GLC, the preservation would be important.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
There is also the GLC research library. It is remarkable and certainly among the top three or four British libraries. It is used by local authorities throughout the world and it is computerised. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that he is not only the Minister for the Arts but the Minister respon-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
sible for the Office of Arts and Libraries. We have tended to be concerned with the British Library, but he must intervene to assist those who are worried about the GLC's research library.<br><br>
The Museum of London is a possible home for the archives. The Minister may disagree, but he must respond to those who believe that we must begin to institute proper archiving of local government records. Already, since the change of structure in Scotland, some of our historical records have begun to- disappear. I was called in recently because someone had come across two boxes of interesting correspondence. I was asked where it should go. That problem could arise on a large scale for the GLC.<br><br>
The Minister should also tell us his thinking on the Society of Archivists' concern with the preservation of the records of the GLC and the other metropolitan areas. With abolition in 1986, an enormous number of records will have to be dealt with. Some of them will doubtless come under the aegis of the joint boards, but they will have their own records to consider. The Society of Archivists wants the task of maintaining the non-current records of the dissolved metropolitan counties. It also wants the records that are worthy of archival preservation.<br><br>
There are three categories of records in the GLC and metropolitan counties: those required to carry on the administration—which must be moved to the successor authorities—those that must be preserved because reference may be required to them in future, and those that will probably not be required again but should be preserved for their historical interest. I am concerned specifically with the last two, especially those that must be preserved for future reference. When we start to reconstruct a government for London in two or three years' time, we shall need them.<br><br>
The head archivist at the Greater London record office should be consulted now. I hope that the Minister will accept the possibility of establishing a record office in association with the Museum of London in which the archives can be deposited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause highlights one of the major problems associated with the abolition of the GLC. When the ill-informed proposals for abolition first emerged, it did not occur to anyone that the GLC was intricately involved with London's history. With the GLC will go the old London county council, Middlesex county council, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the boards of guardians. The GLC stands at the end of a long historical line; it was the successor to all those bodies, which all left records to be handed over to the GLC. The Government are not merely stepping in to abolish an upstart council that has existed since 1984 when the Conservatives created it but whose politics they do not like; they are abolishing a large chunk of London's history. The new clause highlights that dramatically.<br><br>
With about 70 successor bodies—we are not sure of the exact number, and neither, of course, is anyone in Marsham street—the future of records and artefacts will be a serious matter. A number of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
collections will be broken up to such an extent that it will be exceedingly difficult to reassemble them when the impending Labour Government restore city-wide government in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spearing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend enlarge on that? Perhaps mistakenly, I had assumed that the well-managed and comprehensive GLC/LCC archives, once housed in the basement of County Hall and then moved to Clerkenwell, would be retained as a unique and unitary collection. Yet my hon. Friend now implies that the existing collection will be dissipated to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend misunderstood what I was saying. There is no threat to the GLC, LCC and Middlesex county council records housed in the London record office, which is based at Clerkenwell. Provision was made for those records in the abolition Bill, under which the City of London will take responsibility for them. It is intriguing that the City, which declined to take responsibility or to stretch its boundaries to natural London when that was proposed in the 19th century, is prepared to take on London-wide responsibilities. One suspects that the City's willingness to take over the London record office is an attempt to buy insurance in some small way against its own demise. But we shall come back to that in the next Parliament, when we have a Labour Government. It will be an interesting debate, and I hope that I shall be able to take part in it.<br><br>
There is no threat to the records at Clerkenwell. My point was that some departments of the GLC are being preserved in the London Residuary Body or the London co-ordinating committee while some are not, that all of them have records, some of which will unfortunately be lost.<br><br>
We are doing our best at County Hall at the moment to bring together as many of them as possible, because we take this matter very seriously. We are trying to act responsibly in the face of the irresponsible attitude that the Government have shown in abolishing the GLC without any thought of the implications of doing so. One of those implications is highlighted by the new clause.<br><br>
I wish to point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) that there may be difficulties unless we ensure that the Museum of London receives far more resources than are apparent at the moment. I am not carping at the Minister's comments or trying to catch him out, but there are financial implications in the clause which need to be carefuly examined.<br><br>
It is sensible for the museum to have close links with the Greater London record office at Clerkenwell, and the links within the City would make that easier to achieve. The records in the office are an integral part of the social history of London which, of course, also concerns the Museum of London.<br><br>
The architect's department of the Greater London Council has a vast collection of original drawings and plans of London, which date from the previous century, and a valuable collection of rare glass slides.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
County Hall is trying to ensure that those are not lost or damaged in the uncertainty following the abolition of the council on 31 March, by putting as many of those records as possible in the Greater London record office at Clerkenwell.<br><br>
It grates somewhat to see the City of London being given further responsibilities. We are not happy that the assets of a democratically elected London-wide body, such as the GLC, have to be handed over to the City of London, which is confined in both area and democratic terms. However, we must do that now because we want to ensure that, when the next Labour Government come to power, we can pick up as many of these pieces as quickly as possible. We are therefore transferring a smuch as possible to the Greater London record office at Clerkenwell. A link—perhaps provided under the terms of the Bill—between that record office and the Museum of London, would be in the interests of the social history of our capital city.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the new clause has been made clear—to impose a further duty on the Museum of London, under which the present GLC records office would be transferred to it. It is important to ensure that the GLC's records and archives are properly safeguarded on the abolition of the authority. That has been one of the Government's primary objectives and has been achieved by reaching agreement with the corporation of the City of London that it will take over the GLC's records and archives. The Royal Commission on historical manuscripts strongly supports that arrangement.<br><br>
The Museum of London is administratively and professionally capable of looking after those records and archives, but it is important that they should be kept within the responsibilities of local government, because they will continue to be looked after and added to within the same local government context. The City of London is an admirable organisation to take over that responsibility in view of its centuries' old involvement in keeping records and archives. The material will continue to be open and available to the public and—to answer the question of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks)—that includes the Museum of London. The museum could make arrangements with the City of London, if it wished, to take material on loan for exhibition in the museum.<br><br>
The future of the Greater London records office has already been safeguarded and there is no need to impose an additional duty on the Museum of London. I hope that the debate on the new clause has clarified the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made appropriate arrangements to ensure the continuity and safeguarding of the records office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fisher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the arrangements with the City of London will it be its duty not only to maintain existing records and archives, but to continue acquiring them as at present? Is there a danger that it may

circumscribe the range of material that it acquires in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will continue with the same broad objectives that have been fulfilled hitherto.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, our new clause was a probing one. I wish to emphasise its importance and hope that he will be personally involved to ensure that matters are handled in the best possible way, as they are crucial and important.<br><br>
I was glad of the opportunity to discuss the research library. The library associations are especially worried and I know that the Minister has met them to discuss those matters.<br><br>
I cannot pretend that the Opposition think that co-operation with the City of London is necessarily the best solution. I can think of few situations in which we would consider that that was the best solution. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do now report the Bill to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over 15 years, I have served on a variety of Committees, some of which have been extremely laborious and lengthy, but I have found this to be agreeable and enjoyable. We have not al-

ways agreed. Indeed, there were one or two profound disagreements this morning, but that did not detract from the atmosphere.<br><br>
I should like to thank the Committee and, especially, you, Sir Anthony. The Chairman sets the scene and atmosphere and the Committee knows that we had another advantage as you have a personal interest in the Museum of London. That added to the flavour of our discussions and I am grateful for your chairmanship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse those remarks. It has been a short Committee and it would have been much shorter but for the continual interruptions from Back Benchers. However, we must live with that garrulous lot.<br><br>
You, Sir Anthony, have conducted the proceedings with decorum and compassion. When we attempted to discuss matters that were not especially appropriate, you intervened with understanding and without using a sledge hammer. I thank you for that.<br><br>
I also thank the Minister for his helpful co-operation over the past couple of days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first Bill that I have had the pleasure of chairing. If they are all as nice as this one, I shall feel that I have the right job.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill to be reported, without amendments.</i></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at tweleve minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
