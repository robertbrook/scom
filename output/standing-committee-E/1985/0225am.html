</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 30 and succeeding clauses take us to the part of the Bill that attempts to give
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
effect to our obligations under the EEC treaties. Broadly speaking, they oblige us not to impose constraints within the EEC on the conduct of business or the carrying out of trade or of a profession, so we are obliged to seek ways of authorising in this country the carrying out of investemnt business by those who are similarly authorised in other EEC countries.<br><br>
It is widely believed, not just by me, but by others outside the Committee, that clause 30 takes us a good deal further than is required by our obligations under the EEC treaty. Nothing in the amendment is designed to derogate from our treaty obligations, but we feel that by having the provision as wide as it is at present we are unnecessarily creating problems. Indeed, those problems have been described by the Securities and Investments Board as a "major absurdity". I shall explain shortly why SIB holds that view. In broad terms both the stock exchange and the Consumers' Association agree with the objective of this group of amendments. Those bothes do not always agree, and when they do, the Minister and the Committee should take account of their views.<br><br>
As the clause is drafted, someone authorised to carry out one type of investment business in one EEC country will be authorised to carry out all forms of investment business in this country. That, of course, is subject to certain conditions, such, as that he does not have a permanent place of business in the United Kingdom. I ami sorry to pick on the Greeks in this respect, but one can see why it is a telling example; a Greek insurance broker authorised for the purposes of Greek law as a fit and proper person to carry out insurance business in Greece will, by virtue of that authorisation and by virtue of clause 30 and succeeding provisions, be authorised to carry out all forms of investment business in this country. He can manage investment funds, offer investment advice, run collective investment schemes, and so on, on the basis of that limited authorisation for one purpose and in one place; that authorisation will permit him to carry out the full range of investment business in this country.<br><br>
Furthermore—to some degree this point is addressed by amendment No. 219—the authorisation that is required to bring a Euro-person—if I may use that term—will be concerned solely with whether he is a fit and proper person.<br><br>
The authorisation required and identified under clause 30 is imply the equivalence of rules established under chapter III which deals solely with the process of authorisation and the requirement of fitness and properness, and has nothing to do with the range of other rules and regulations which will be made under chapters V and VI, particularly the conduct of business rules.<br><br>
The authorisation which is all that is required to enable an EEC business man to carry out the full range of investment business is not only limited to> his own country and a particular sort of investment,, but refers to business for which he must be fit and proper. However, there need be no corresponding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
provisions through our own conduct of business rules. Therefore, it is a limited authorisation which is a gateway into a virtually unregulated ability to carry out investment business in this country.<br><br>
The ability of the SIB or other designated agency to enforce the rules will be limited in this case. Almost by definition, a person who seeks and obtains authorisation under this provision will be substantially out of the jurisdiction so that the capacity of the authorities to enforce conduct of business rules could be limited. Even the provisions on giving notice under clause 31, without which a criminal offence would be committed, will be difficult to enforce if the person concerned stays outside the jurisdiction.<br><br>
Does any of that matter? It matters because someone who obtains authorisation for these broad purposes by means of going through this narrow gateway may be providing and carrying on a range of investment services that do not match up to the conduct of business rules applied to indigenous operators.<br><br>
That means that the investor may not be offered the protection mat he has a right to expect under these provisions. In addition, UK operators and business men offering investment advice and carrying out investment business may find that they are subject to unfair competition because they have to compete with people who are not necessarily obliged to meet the requirement laid down by the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister might object that the amendment would involve us in a conflict with our EEC obligations. I am advised that that is not so, as nothing in the EEC treaties requires us to assume that our EEC partners have the same rules and regulations as us. We are obliged simply to have an equivalence of requirements so that they apply equally to nationals of each EEC country. Nothing in the amendment would cause problems over that.<br><br>
The Secretary of State or designated agency will have the power to require people authorised in the UK to limit themselves to particular kinds of investment business—clauses 10(3), 15(2) and 45(2Xa) all allow for that. The Minister has assured us several times that those powers will be used and that there will be provisions for limiting the kinds of investment business for which people are authorised. However, under clause 30 that power will not apply to Euro-persons authorised by this route. The amendment is designed to make it possible for the Minister to limit the authorisation obtained under the provision to the particular kind of investment business for which authorisation has been secured in the country of origin.<br><br>
I hope mat the Minister will look kindly on amendment No. 100. I also support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) which are partly consequential but which in their own right under clause 31 are directed at a similar objective. They have an independent purpose as well as a correlative purpose to amendment No. 100. I imagine that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will agree that the amendments are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
designed to move towards the same objective. That objective is important and I hope that it will command widespread support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is real concern here. We are setting up a regime for investor protection in the regulation of markets in the United Kingdom which will be pretty tight. I do not know whether, like me, other members of the Committee receive an enormous amount of unsolicited material in the post, some of it from overseas. For example, letters from Germany invite me to take part in a state lottery or to invest in this, that or the other. Nothing much can be done about such mail, but it illustrates the likelihood that, after the Bill is enacted, many of those who operate here and send such material through the post might simply move offshore, into the EEC. They might obtain some kind of authorisation which, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, could be far less onerous than that proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
Clauses 30 and 31 are so drafted that there would be no way to prevent such persons from carrying on investment business here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle <span class='memberconstituency'> (Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that although unsolicited post from abroad is bad enough, at least its origin can be identified by the stamp or post mark? Is my hon Friend aware of the growing practice of some insurance salesmen who operate by telephone from places such as the Netherlands? They are often British nationals operating on behalf of companies that sound British and it is impossible to tell whether the call comes from abroad. Surely that is additional grist to the mill in support of my hon. Friend's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously a serious additional concern. I have not been subjected to it because no one can get me on the telephone, but people at the end of the telephone are the innocent victims of such sales methods. As my hon. Friend said, people cannot tell where the telephone call is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the. hon Gentleman for giving way and to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) for his helpful intervention. It prompts me to mention a relevant aspect which I omitted earlier. Far from regarding the provisions of the amendment as a problem or a derogation of our treaty obligations, our EEC partners, and especially the Dutch, are worried about the loophole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The other member states should be looking closely at the Bill to see whether they should introduce investor protection measures to provide a similar degree of equivalence. But that is a matter for them and I am not suggesting that we should have more EEC directives on the subject.<br><br>
Amendment No. 145 is designed to deal with the difficulty that, at present, there is nothing to prevent someone authorised to carry on business in another member state from carrying out any kind of investment business here. The hon. Member for Dagenham mentioned a Greek insurance broker but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
it could be a Portuguese commodity salesman. Amendment No. 145 would ensure that such persons could carry out only the same kind of investment business in this country.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 146 and 147 are designed to improve the information requirements in clause 31. The three amendments were suggested by SIB and Nos. 146 and 147 would provide SIB with the information that it needed to enforce amendment No. 145.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will look favourably on the amendments and that there are no obstacles in existing EEC rules and regulations. If we do nothing about the problem there will be a major loophole in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'> (Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider the problem that might arise in respect of authorised persons, who do not come from member states, but from other countries? I sympathise with the comments of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), and of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), but we must ask ourselves whether we should not only give credence to the EC position, but should consider whether there is a valid equivalence test in respect of other member states outside the EC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdowm <span class='memberconstituency'> (Yeovil)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment because it clarifies the position stated by the hon. Member for Dagenham- (Mr. Gould). I shall not go further, as he has covered the ground very well.<br><br>
However, I ask the Minister to clarify the status of inhabitants of Guernsey and Jersey. As I understand it, a hybrid position may apply to them because they are not British nationals in the accepted sense, nor do Guernsey and Jersey constitute an EC country in the accepted sense. If the Minister's civil servants are at present too busy with other matters, perhaps he will reply later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Important points have been raised and I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I reply to them at length.<br><br>
The amendments have a common theme, but treat it rather differently. The theme is that a person authorised by clause 30 should be allowed to carry on in the United Kingdom only the investment business for which he is authorised in the member state in which he is established, which, for convenience, I shall call his home state.<br><br>
The variation proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) treats the question directly. Both amendments Nos. 100 and 33 would limit the authorisation conferred by clause 30 to the extent of the person's home state authorisation. If a person authorised by those provisions were to carry on investment business here, outside the scope of his home state authorisation, he would be committing a criminal offence.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
The Committee will recall our debate in the first and second sittings about whether authorisation should be limited to specified types of investment business or whether the necessary limitations on an authorised person's activities should be contained in rules. The same arguments that applied in that general case apply in this specific case, and I need not repeat them.<br><br>
The essential difference between us is whether a criminal offence should be created or whether there should be no criminal offence, but all the civil remethes to which I referred should be available.<br><br>
But there are three additional reasons why the approach based on rules is right. First, the distinction between different kinds of investment business may be different in other member states from that prevailing here, whether the distinction was made in legislation or in the rules. Under the amendment, a United Kingdom court might have to decide whether, say, a French company carrying on investment business in the United Kingdom was carrying on business of a kind for which it was authorised in France. That would involve the United Kingdom courts in interpreting French law.<br><br>
Secondly, it would be discriminatory to impose a criminal sanction on persons authorised by clause 30, who strayed over the boundaries of a specific type of investment business, but a civil sanction on directly authorised persons and members of recognised self-regulating organisations and professional bothes. It would also be disproportionate to the end to be achieved, which, as I shall explain later, can be achieved without criminal sanctions. In order to be compatible with the EEC treaty, however, restrictions on the right to provide services must be proportionate and applied without discrimination to all persons operating in the member state in question.<br><br>
Thirdly, it would be a strange approach to impose criminal sanctions in a case where, by definition, the person has no permanent place of business here, but to rely on civil sanctions for persons established here.<br><br>
Those difficulties would result from the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham.<br><br>
The variation embothed in amendment No. 145, proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), and also in amendments Nos. 101 and 102 when considered in isolation from amendment No. 100, is more subtle. These amendments all concern the notice which a person authorised by virtue of clause 30 is required to submit before he starts to carry on investment business here. The notice has to include information about the investment business which the person proposes to carry on here. The amendments provide that this business would have to be business of a kind which he was authorised to carry on in his home state.<br><br>
Under clause 45 (2) <i>(a)</i> (ii) the Secretary of State or designated agency would have the power to make rules prohibiting a person from carrying on
<br><blockquote><p>"investment business of a kind</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0186">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
not specified in a notice under the clause unless he has subsequently notified his revised plans. The effect of the amendments would therefore be that a person authorised by virtue of clause 30 would break such rules if, without previously notifying the Secretary of State or designated agency, he carried on investment business of a type for which he was not authorised in his home state. That approach avoids many of the problems attaching to that underlying amendments Nos. 100 and 33, but it would still give the prospect of United Kingdom courts having to interpret the law of other member states, and in any case a person could avoid its intended effect by submitting at the same time as his initial notice a revised plan outlining other types of business he intended to carry on.<br><br>
I should say that in many ways I sympathise with some of the sentiments underlying all these amendments. If a person is authorised in another member state to sell, say, life insurance, the Bill should not give him <i>carte blanche</i> to come here and sell gold futures. But the Bill already provides two key safeguards against this: the first is that the conduct of business rules will apply to persons authorsed by virtue of clause 30 just as they apply to others. So in the example, the foreign insurance salesman selling gold futures here would be subject to exactly the same rules as everybody else selling gold futures here.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham suggested that there would be particular difficulties of enforcement in relation to the conduct of business rules in regard to people outside the jurisdiction, but those difficulties would be at least as great in relation to breaches of the criminal law, which would be the effect of his amendment. His amendment would not resolve that difficulty.<br><br>
The second safeguard lies in the powers of intervention that the Secretary of State or designated agency will possess. A notice submitted under clause 31 will have to contain details not only of the investment business which the person wished to carry on in the United Kindom, but also of his authorisation in his home state. If the business which the person proposed to carry on was different from that for which he was authorised, that could well raise doubts in the mind of the Secretary of State or designated agency as to whether it was desirable in the interests of investors to let him proceed. If not, he or it could issue a restriction of business order under clause 60 prohibiting the person in question from carrying on investment business other than that for which he was authorised in his home state. The person could refer the matter to the tribunal, but the order would stay in force while he did so.<br><br>
Any breach of the order would attract the same penalties as a breach of the rules under the approach envisaged in amendments Nos. 145, 101 and 102: civil suits by investors, injunctions and restitution orders under clause 56, and termination or suspension of authorisation under clause 32. I believe that these provisions provide sufficient
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
safeguards to meet the concerns that have been expressed, and that the amendments are therefore unnecessary.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 146 and 147 address a slightly different point. They would allow the Secretary of State or designated agency to prescribe particular details which had to be included in any notice submitted under clause 31. The clause already allows regulations to be made concerning the form in which information is to be given, and the manner in which it is to be verified. Such regulations could, for instance, require information about a person's home state authorisation to be verified by the Government in question. The existing provision will be sufficient to enable the Secretary of State or designated agency to make the regulations necessary to obtain that information. But if there are any particular areas which my hon. Friend believes are not covered, I shall be happy to consider another amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that point, SIB says that, as it stands, the clause can be used only to require information about new matters. There is no power in the clause to obtain further details about existing matters. For example, if someone said that he was authorised for insurance business in Greece, there would be no power to ask for more details about that authorisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point needs further consideration. I am not convinced that it is not covered in the Bill but if an amendment is needed, I shall be happy to consider bringing one forward.<br><br>
It remains only for me to deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) on the position of the residents of Guernsey and Jersey. As Guernsey and Jersey are not members of the European Community, the provisions would not apply to residents, who would need to be authorised by on of the other groups of authorisation specified in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked a question about non-EEC states. Will my hon. and learned Friend consider that matter, and perhaps drop me a note?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I am certainly prepared to drop my hon. Friend a note on the matter, I have undertaken to consider a number of such questions, and I am not anxious to add to them. Therefore, I am happy to assent only to the second possibility which my hon. Friend proffered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One wonders what that note will say.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the Minister, and I think that I managed to follow his line of reasoning. If not, it was due to my own inadequacy, rather than to his explanation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Hayward) may laugh, but we are debating complicated matters, and I do not pretend to have mastery of all of them. I am probably the only member of the Committee who is neither a lawyer nor a stockbroker of some kind.<br><br>
The route explained by the Minister in this difficult and complicated area is amazingly cumbersome. We may expect people from abroad to use the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0187">Image</span>

flexibility of the law to the maximum. It will be slow in dealing with the considerable problem of people operating from abroad under authorisations given in their own country and not here. Business rules and restrictions will have to be established. It will be an inadequate way of dealing with the problems outlined by the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).<br><br>
The Minister's argument for not accepting one or other of those amendments—perhaps the amendment of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is more elegant—rests on treating those EC member states differently to those from Britain. The Minister is seeking to achieve equivalence of treatment. Will he tell me whether that is the centre of his argument, or whether he feels that the amendments of the hon. Members for Dagenham and for Beaconsfield will infringe EC rules and laws? If it is only a question of different treatment, I find no particular problem about that. After all, we have to recognise that people from other members states of the EC will have certain specific advantages in terms of business and trading that people here may not have because of our tighter laws.<br><br>
I would much prefer the Minister to err on the side of control by accepting either of the two amendments before him rather than to fall back onto pure equivalence of treatment of people who start from different positions because the regulations operating in this country are different from those that may operate abroad.<br><br>
I fear that the answer that the Minister has offered will prove in practice to be far too cumbersome, and far too slow, to counter some of the problems that may occur through the route that the two amendments have revealed.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'> (Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary of State to clarify the position of those parts of other member states that are in a position analogous to that of the Channel Islands? I am thinking, for example, of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Could he at least consider that, even if he is unable to give an immethate response?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary of State had two objections to the approach adopted in amendment No. 145 which, he conceded, was a more subtle approach. The second of those objections, as I understood it, was that even if that approach were to be adopted, it could be avoided by somebody who gave a revised notice of his intention to do business at the same time as he gave his original notice. I hope that I have understood that correctly; my hon. and learned Friend did make rather a complicated speech. That does not seem to be a very good objection, because we could prevent that from happening by adding a proposal to deal with it.<br><br>
A more substantial objection was that we would still face the prospect of United Kingdom courts interpreting the law of other EC member states. However, I cannot believe that that would be un-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
precedented. Given the Treaty of Rome and the endless agreements and directives under it, surely from time to time, as a result of commercial contracts and so on, it is not just the European Court that has to interpret the law of member states or EC law.<br><br>
Would the safeguards referred to by my hon. and learned Friend be sufficient in practice? I would like to see a stronger and a more direct regime, if that is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). The Minister has pointed out some of the difficulties involved in any attempt to grapple with the problem, but he has not solved the problem, which remains an extremely worrying one.<br><br>
A person seeking authorisation could avoid any of the constraints applied to him by clause 31 simply by submitting amended notices. The Minister relied on the point that the conduct of business rules could then be applied to him, but it would be very difficult to apply those rules to the example given by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle)) of the insurance salesman phoning up from the Hague who never comes anywhere near this country.<br><br>
I take the Minister's point that equal problems arise in respect of the criminal law, but they bear upon the initial authorisation rather than a subsequent breach of the conduct of business rules.<br><br>
The debate has illustrated a continuing difficulty that has arisen between the Minister and Opposition Members and, perhaps, some Conservative Members. We believe that the process of authorisation is of considerable importance, because that is where the controls and safeguards must be built in and applied. Once we let people through the gate into the area where they are carrying out investment business, it will be difficult—in some cases too late —to try to impose rules and regulations on them, and to stop abuses.<br><br>
It will be even more difficult when one is dealing with people who are outside the jurisdiction and whose initial authorisation may have little to do with the type of investment business that they are carrying out in this country.<br><br>
The Minister appears to be content to rely on ex post facto control through the enforcement of conduct of business rules. To let people through an easy gateway to the carrying out of investment business in this country—some of those people may be completely unsuitable, even under the law of their own country—is to put the integrity of the whole scheme at grave risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that it discriminates against people who operate in this country alone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for referring to me in such warm terms. I am even more grateful to him for making such a powerful point. That is exactly what I am saying.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
An operator based in the United Kingdom will be subject to more onerous requirements for authorisation and, in practical terms, to more supervision by an SRO or the SIB than a Greek insurance broker or a Dutch insurance salesman. The Minister has not dealt with those important practical matters.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that the British courts could be involved in difficult questions of the interpretation of foreign law, if they had to distinguish between the sorts of investment business authorised in the home country. I agree wth his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on that point. Our courts and those of other EC countries have to face up to such interpretation from time to time on a variety of issues. It is an inevitable consequence of our membership of the EC, and is not a reason for not adopting sensible regulations.<br><br>
The courts will have to look behind the labels, which may not coincide in every respect. If a Frenchman, Greek, or Portuguese has been authorised to conduct a type of business that is described in a way that has no equivalent in British law, we shall have to look behind that label to see what the substance is. As the Minister will know, our courts have been doing that, where international laws conflict, for centuries. It is not a problem for the courts, so it is not a substantial argument against the sensible purpose behind the amendments.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will listen to the SIB and to those of his hon. Friends who seem to sympathise with me general thrust of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)—perhaps provoked by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash)— has overlooked the starting point for the provision. That is easy to do. It is to be found in clause 30(3), which requires the protection for investors in the home country of the person seeking authorisation to be " at least equivalent" to that provided for investors by the rest of chapter III. So equivalence of protection is the starting point of the clause.<br><br>
There is no question of reverse discrimination against those who wish to carry out investment business in the United Kingdom and who have to seek authorisation as required by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to bring the point up in the clause stand part debate, but I shall do so now, as the Minister is speaking of equivalence of protection. He may have seen my starred amendment No. 220 which seeks to introduce the words
<br><blockquote><p>"both in principle and in practice ".</p></blockquote>
Many European countries have statutory provisiones of one sort or another, which judged in statutory terms may appear equivalent, but are not equivalent in the way that they are applied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course that would be most undesirable. It is not our intention simply to compare forms of words, and from those to decide that the protection provided is equivalent. Of course we must see that equivalent protection is afforded
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"in principle and in practice".</p></blockquote>
That being so, the equivalence is the starting point for the clause, and 1 suggest that some arguments made this morning have overlooked that important requirement.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) put two points which relate to the essence of the argument. He asked whether the provision is included simply to conform with the requirements of European Community law, or whether we are suggesting that the amendments are unnecessary.<br><br>
The answer to the hon. Member's two questions is, "Both". We suggest that the amendments are unnecessary because, despite the arguments that have been advanced, we see no advantage in increasing the scope of criminal sanction as opposed to civil liability, which would be the effect of the amendments of the hon. Member for Dagenham.<br><br>
The considerations which applied in our earlier debate on this subject also apply here, reinforced by the desirability of conforming to the provisions of European Economic Community law. It is very much in the interests of the United Kingdom to liberalise the approach taken within the European Community to these matters. It therefore behoves us to be very careful that our legislation accords with provisions on matters on which we are pressing our partners hard, in the hope that they will make the aspirations of the treaty a reality—from which we expect to benefit.<br><br>
My reply to the hon. Member for Yeovil is twofold: I believe that the amendments are unnecessary, and that they would lead us into conflict with our obligations under the treaty.<br><br>
I realise that the substantial investment community in the Faroe islands is waiting with bated breath to hear my answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), but I hope that I shall be forgiven if I do not reply to him here and now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on the distinction introduced by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) between " in principle " and " in practice "? Where is there any reference to what happens in practice? Why is it not necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is totally unnecessary. When a provision in the Bill requires someone to have regard to whether protection afforded to investors is equivalent, it involves looking to see that the protection is equivalent in practice. It is implied in the language of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that one difficulty here is that there is no real harmonisation under article 100 as applied to investment business throughout the Community? If the right of establishment is the right to provide services and so on, under article 58 of the Treaty of Rome, a problem arises.<br><br>
I have sympathy with my hon. and learned Friend as we must comply with our EEC obligations, but, because there is no harmonisation programme, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
shall have to apply provisions of this kind, as we have to comply with our general obligations under the treaty anyway.<br><br>
However, as there is a disparity between the kind of provisions which apply in different member states, this may be the only practical way in which to overcome the problem in amendment No. 100. I have much sympathy with what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) says, but because of the inherent difficulties I have mentioned, my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is right.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that he objected to the amendments on two grounds'—first, because they would conflict with our EEC treaty obligations and, secondly, because they are unnecessary. How would the amendment conflict with our treaty obligations? I think that the clause as drafted is wider than is required by our treaty obligations and that the amendments would satisfy obligations we have undertaken. If the Minister is right, that concludes the matter and there is no point in debating the amendments. However if he is wrong, or not as right as he seeks to persuade the Committee that he is, the question whether the amendments are necessary is important.<br><br>
On several occasions the Minister sought to frighten the Committee by asking why we should bring in the whole panoply of the criminal law to deal with the issue, as the amendments would require, when we can deal with it perfectly well through the conduct of business rules. That is another way of putting the same argument that the issue arises at the point of authorisation. We believe, and I think that there is some sympathy for our view among Conservative Members too, that that is where it counts.<br><br>
It is true that the Bill provides criminal sanctions to deal with any failure to comply with authorisation provisions. If we carry out investment business without auhorisation we commit an offence. However, that is implicit in the thrust and structure of the Bill and the notion of authorisation.<br><br>
We are not disputing whether the criminal law should be brought in—that is a tendentious way of putting the point. We are disputing whether the authorisation requirement should be relatively stricter than is currently provided. Therefore, I am not sure whether the Minister's continued reference to the criminal law adds much to the debate.<br><br>
The Minister was right that clause 30 (3) refers to equivalence—a level of investment protection which is " at least equivalent". However, by virtue of the reference to chapter III we are concerned only with the level of investment protection to be provided by applying the test of fitness and proper-ness.<br><br>
The question whether a British operator who seeks authorisation should obtain it will be decided with reference to a known body of rules, when the conduct of business rules have been published. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
shall then know what they contain and what an authorised person will be required to comply with.<br><br>
However, we can have no guarantee that any conduct of business rules will apply in the home country of a person who seeks authorisation. He is required only to obtain some form of authorisation which certifies that he is a fit and proper person, not for the purpose of carrying out investment business at large but for the purpose of carrying out a specific kind of investment business in a specific place where the standards of business behaviour may be different from ours.<br><br>
The Minister said that we should not seek to impose barriers. We are in danger of selling ourselves short. This is one of the few areas in which we are pre-eminent within the EEC. It suits us to try to establish a free market in services, but that market will depend not on the Bill but on the Minister and his colleagues for as long as they are in office and on their negotiations with our EEC partners on the internal market and on the freeing of the provision of insurance and other services. Surely our interest is to ensure that any harmonisation in the EEC, which I agree is desirable, should be to our high standards.<br><br>
We are fortunate that the Bill will establish for the first time rules and regulations that will set high standards. It is perverse to attempt to dilute their effect by allowing authorisation across the board to everyone in the EEC, irrespective of whether they meet our proposed standards.<br><br>
If the consequence of this and later amendments was to require other EEC countries to impose similar rules on authorisation, that would be to our advantage. It would raise standards generally and require other operators throughout the EEC to meet the standards that we believe necessary. Surely the Minister cannot wish a solution whereby people in other EEC countries could obtain authorisation without meeting the standards of our own conduct of business rules, yet that is what he appears to be arguing.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept that in trying to divert attention from authorisation to the subsequent application of conduct of business rules, he is not dealing with the essential problem, which I shall restate for the umpteenth time. Clause 30 would give those offering investment services and other business services in the EEC an easy route to authorisation. No matter what is done subsequently to attempt to apply the conduct of business rules to what will by then be considerable problems those operators will still be authorised for a substantial period. That spells great danger for both investors and United Kingdom competitors.<br><br>
The Minister may have dismissed the argument of his hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) about the Faroe Islands a little too lightly. We have already heard about people operating by telephone from the Netherlands. We are dealing with those at the fringes of such activities who will look for loopholes. It would not be surprising if an operator left the Faroe Islands and got
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
a business address elsewhere from which to carry out his service. We cannot be too dismissive about such arguments if there are such loopholes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a substantial financial services community in the Faroe Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to defer to the hon. Gentleman's greater expertise. No doubt we are agreed on the potential importance of such a loophole, if it exists. Will the Minister tell us first, precisely how the EEC treaties would be breached by the amendment and secondly, whether he will accept that authorisation is the key note and ex post facto control is unlikely to be affected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was in deference to the substantial investment community in the Faroe Islands that I was anxious to wait and to provide a considered answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill).<br><br>
I fear that, somewhat uncharacteristically, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is going round in ever diminishing circles. His latest arguments are essentially the same as his earlier observations so. not surprisingly, my answers will also be similar.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has failed to face up to the weaknesses in his argument. He suggests that I should not put at the centre of the argument the place that the criminal law may or not may have, but that is precisely the effect of the change that he proposes. He seeks to substitute the criminal law for the range of civil remedies that will be available under the Bill. He has failed to explain how it would be any easier to enforce the criminal law on those who carry out investment business from outside the jurisdiction than it would be to enforce the conduct of business rules. That was one of his principal criticisms of relying on the conduct of business rules in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I am obliged to intervene to repeat for the third time that it is not I who am introducing the concept of criminal sanctions; that is in the Bill. It is a corollary of the whole concept of authorisation. The argument is not about criminal sanctions but about whether the time of authorisation is the important moment. The Opposition argue that it is there that it matters. If we wait until later, it may be too late.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument is whether the criminal law is introduced into the circumstances that are covered by clause 30. To introduce the criminal law into those circumstances would afford no advantages, for the reasons that I have given. The amendments would take the clause into conflict with the provisions of our obligations under the EEC treaty because if someone satisfies the requirements of his home state, namely, that he is authorised to carry on investment business under a regime that affords an equivalent degree of protection to that afforded by the law in the United Kingdom, it is contrary to the treaty to place additional obligations on such a person who wishes to carry out investment business in the United Kingdom. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
what I am advised and it is also my own view of the matter. The amendments would take us outside conformity with the treaty.<br><br>
For those reasons I maintain that the amendments are not necessary, and neither do they avoid conflict with our obligations under the European treaty and they should be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess to being entirely unconvinced by the Minister's arguments on our treaty obligations. I recommend his civil servants to look at that question in more detail. Surely there is nothing in EEC treaties that requires us to go further than to say of a Greek insurance broker who is authorised to carry out insurance business in Greece that he is permitted to carry out insurance broking in this country. Furthermore, he could be an investment manager, a pension fund manager, and so on here.<br><br>
Equally, when the Minister places reliance on the equivalence of investment protection, his very provision relates only to the fitness and properness test It has no reference to any body of rules that may, or may not, exist in the home country. As it is not for us to dictate to our EEC partners the rules that they should apply, and as we are simply saying that the rules should provide an equivalence of investment protection, it is difficult to see why we should be in breach of our treaty obligations.<br><br>
Although the Minister will no doubt wish to adhere to his arguments on whether the amendments are necessary, I do not believe that he has made a good case for saying that the clause is required in those terms under our treaty obligations. In our relations with the EEC we have been characteristically over zealous in trying to meet our obligations. Many other countries who look in a far more parsimonious way at what they had to do to meet their obligations. We have gone further than is required.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"page 19, line 16, leave out ' Chapter' and insert ' Part'."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to detain the Committee, as we have already covered much of the ground, but this is a separate point, which inevitably intruded into our earlier debate.<br><br>
The authorities are required, in the equivalence test, to consider not only the provisions in chapter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0191">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
III—the fitness and properness test—but the body of rules under chapters V and VI. That would compel other EEC countries, wishing to secure authorisation for their nationals under the provisions, to harmonise their rules at an equivalent standard to ours.<br><br>
At present, the authorisation procedure, whether directly, or through the SROs or other means, will be assessed by the designated agency in relation to a body of rules—in respect of capital adequacy, for example—which will probably have been published by that time. As I understand it, no reference could be made under the provision to any rules about capital adequacy, which may or may not exist in Greece, Portugal, Spain or any other EEC member country.<br><br>
The Minister is again relying on the subsequent application of our conduct of business rules, but I am talking about conduct of business rules which may not apply in the case of the home country. Reference to that body of rules will be important in determining whether the equivalent provisions of the Bill are met in the home country.<br><br>
The Minister is involved in a logical problem. We are providing an authorisation based on equivalence, but, when we tax the Minister with the equivalence provision, he says, "No, that is met by reference to our rules." He is missing the point that we must seek equivalent treatment by reference to an equivalent body of rules in the home country.<br><br>
The amendment is designed to secure that objective, and to ensure mat the provisions of the heart of the Bill, rather man simply of chapter III, are incorporated in the general equivalence test. I hope mat the Minister will not repeat the logically flawed point mat the equivalence provision is met by subsequent reference to a body of rules, which we apply. That is not relevant to authorisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The equivalence test is met by the equivalence of authorisation, provided in clause 30 (3). Any apprehension felt by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) which may arise from the authorisation will be met by the conduct of business rules.<br><br>
I am not saying quite what me hon. Gentleman suggested I would say, but I am dealing with the logic implicit in his argument, and for those reasons I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am profoundly unimpressed and unpersuaded by the Minister's attempt at logic, as I imagine that many people outside the Committee wil also be. However, as we have now debated the matter at some length, and voted on an earlier amendment seeking a similar objective, and since I cannot imagine a further Division producing an outcome any more congenial to the Opposition, I beg to ask leave to withdraw me amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the unfortunate absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who is suffering from flu, this may be an appropriate time to ask the question that he sought to elucidate through amendment No. 163.<br><br>
Clause 31 provides that an authorised person should give notice in writing of his intention to carry on investment business, but the question is how much notice. I have seen reference elsewhere to a month's notice, although I am not sure that that appears in the Bill. It may be part of the rules eventually to be made. How much notice will in practice be required?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) in not reopening the background to amendment No. 163 of his hon. Friend me Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) which would require a person authorised under clause 30 to give three months' notice of intention to carry on investment business in the United Kingdom, rather than, as is possible under the clause, by giving immediate notice.<br><br>
The amendment would not enable the Secretary of State or designated agency to take action more quickly, because it could not be taken until the person had started to carry on his investment business in the United Kingdom. The only ground on which the three months notice would be justified would be that it would enable the Secretary of State or designated agency to take action to prevent a person from exercising his rights under the treaty on the basis of whether the test of equivalence was met.<br><br>
The effect of the treaty, as I have sought to explain more than once, is that a person who fulfils the conditions in clause 30 is entitled to supply services in the United Kingdom without being made subject to any further authorisation process. To impose a requirement of this sort on such a person would be to restrict his ability to exercise his rights without necessarily enabling action to be taken any more quickly against a person who would not be entitled to any rights under the treaty. For that reason, I believe the amendment to be out of proportion to the ends it would achieve, and incompatible with the treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his remarks. Those who have been following our proceedings carefully in the <i>Hansard</i> record will see that, perhaps inadvertently, the Minister has conceded a good deal of my case on earlier amendments. In what he has just said he emphasised the considerable importance of what he regards as the treaty's ambit in forestalling, or not forestalling, someone who perhaps ought not to be authorised, according to me standards mat we should like

applied, from setting himself up as carrying out investment business in this country for some time.<br><br>
That is the inevitable conclusion of the Minister's argument, although it is not appropriate to open that debate yet again. Will any length of notice be required? I understand what me Minister said in relation to three months, but is he saying that no notice will be required?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Notice has to be be given before the carrying on of business, but it could be given immediately beforehand.</span></p>

The amendment raises a matter that to some degree has been dealt with earlier. It seeks to introduce a needs criterion for investment exchanges similar to the provision in clause 10(4) for SROs. The amendment is supported by SIB; although I am not sure whether it is worth rehearsing that fact, as the Minister often seem unpersuaded by its views. Nevertheless, SIB believes that the amendment is required because it may be needed to promote the development of orderly, effective and centralised markets. SIB fears that if such a provision is not included, a proliferation of competing markets may result, which would militate against the desire to regulate those markets effectively. It would mean that the centralisation of information in dealings in some types of transaction would be lost. There would be fragmentation of that information and grave difficulties would result in regulating such a proliferation of competing markets.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to say a few words about the potential difficulty of the interface between SROs and recognised investment exchanges. Problems may arise out of the role of the stock exchange which, in the past, has in effect been both. Difficulties may arise if there is an unwillingness by major conglomerates to join a range of SROs. If they seek direct authorisation as their preferred means of obtaining authorisation, given their enormous power and weight in the market, they may set up their own competing recognised investment exchanges, thus compounding the problem.<br><br>
In other words, if the Secretary of State or the designated agency has no power to say that there is already a recognised investment exchange in, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
example, domestic securities, it may be difficult to resist on normal prudential grounds an attempt by major financial conglomerates to set up their own competing financial investment market and to secure authorisation directly. That would undercut the position of the stock exchange to an unfortunate and alarming degree.<br><br>
Although I am not especially disposed to argue a brief for the stock exchange, it would be an unfortunate outcome of this part of the Bill if the Minister's failure of foresight weakened the only institution in the City with a reasonably good record and substantial experience and expertise in regulating its affairs and market.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The thrust of the Bill ought to be to encourage the unification of potentially varied investment markets. I welcome, for example, the negotiations between the stock exchange and the International Securities Regulatory Organisation in that respect. It would be useful for the Bill to contain a reserve power, which could give impetus to such negotiations. It might greatly assist the successful completion of negotiations if it were clear that failure to negotiate an acceptable agreement on which investment exchange should be used for specific purposes, would involve intervention by the Secretary of State or the designated agency. In the absence of such a reserve power, and as the Minister's earlier refusal of an amendment opened the route of direct authorisation, there is a danger that powerful financial institutions may be able to provide for their own recognised investment exchange. That would be contrary to the Minister's objectives and the structures laid down in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give his views on the amendment, and explain how he envisages the operation of the difficult relationship between investment exchanges and SROs. Will he assure us that the stock exchange will not be placed in a difficult position as a result of the provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the debate continues, I wish to make an announcement about my provisional selection of amendments. I understand that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) tabled two amendments to clause 40 on Friday, but, for some reason, they did not reach the Public Bill Office until Monday. The Committee will realise, therefore, that they appear starred, for the first time on this morning's amendment paper.<br><br>
I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman. I have to consider the rights of other Committee members, but I have taken soundings, and those rights will not be jeopardised. I propose, therefore, to show my sympathy by selecting those two amendments, if we reach them during this morning's sitting. They would be selected, in any case, for this afternoon's sitting because the starring would no longer be relevant, but I wanted to raise the point so that the hon. Gentleman can proceed with his amendments and everyone is aware of the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises an important point. I shall begin by referring to the concept
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
of a recognised investment exchange, and shall proceed to explain the reasons why the Government do not believe that the power which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggested should be included in the Bill is necessary. I shall conclude by commenting on the more general points that he has raised.<br><br>
An investment exchange is essentially a market place—somewhere one can buy and sell investments of a specific kind and where specific facilities are provided for users. Market places were created to do business and, as the origins of the stock exchange show, they were run as businesses.<br><br>
The Bill is designed to provide a competitive and regulated environment. It is envisaged that those running a market will normally be carrying on investment business as defined in schedule 1 and will require to be authorised unless that market or exchange obtains exemption by becoming "recognised". There is no requirement to be recognised. Subject to obtaining authorisation, any person will be able to run an investment exchange. " Recognition " is a seal of good practice which indicates that the exchange meets the requirements of schedule 3, which are designed to provide particular safeguards for investors.<br><br>
The most important of these safeguards are disclosure of price information, the provision of a market for the sale of investments traded on the exchange, proper regulation of dealings on the exchange and arrangements for ensuring the performance of contracts. In short, it is the sort of market which the unsophisticated investor wishing to deal in the investments concerned should be encouraged to use. In principle, there is no reason why any investment exchange that meets these requirements should not be recognised.<br><br>
I do not think that the analogy with the need criterion for RSROs is a good one. The main purpose and function of an SRO is the regulation of its members. Regulatory competition between SROs is undesirable if it leads to a lowering of standards, and the Bill provides safeguards to prevent such a situation from developing. Some overlap between SROs needs to be allowed so that each SRO can cover a sensible and convenient range of investment activities. If there were no overlap, investment businesses would have to join an unnecessarily large number of SROs to cover all their activities. But subject to this point, in principle it is desirable that there should be as few SROs as possible regulating the same kinds of investment activity. A "need" criterion is therefore desirable for SROs and that is why we included one in the Bill.<br><br>
The argument in the case of investment exchanges is different. No one would normally consider limiting the numbers of approved markets on which a product could be sold. That is the antithesis of the Government's competition policy. There is no reason why there should not be competition between regulated markets, provided that the competition does not affect standards. The argument advanced for restricting numbers; here is that it is more efficient
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
to have a centralised market. I certainly accept that there are dangers in having an unduly fragmented market with no depth of liquidity in any part of that market, although publication of price information can greatly reduce the disadvantages of a fragmented market. The Bill already enables recognition to be refused on investor protection grounds if, for example, there would not be a proper market in the investments to be traded on the exchange.<br><br>
What is being sought here is a power to refuse recognition to an exchange on the grounds that the Secretary of State or agency considers another recognised exchange to be " unnecessary " not on investor protection grounds, but on grounds that are basically economic. It would mean that the Secretary of State or the designated agency could reject an application on the ground that all trading in a particular type of investment should be concentrated in one recognised investment exchange.<br><br>
I am concerned that such a power might inhibit the development of new investment products and of new ways of doing business. For example, a new exchange with a more efficient settlement system, which it believed would, in a year or so, reduce costs significantly, could be refused recognition because there was already a recognised exchange for the kinds of investment dealt in on the new exchange and because the Secretary of State or agency thought that another recognised exchange was not necessary. SIB has said that it would not be its intention to discourage the emergence of new means of trading securities, and I am sure that that is true.<br><br>
However, I question whether it is right to give an agency a power to refuse recognition on need grounds. It might use the power because it concluded—perhaps mistakenly, that some new idea was not of sufficient value to justify recognising another exchange. The result could be that new ideas were not developed, that they were developed away from the recognised investment exchanges in markets which offer less investor protection, or that they were developed abroad. None of those results would be desirable, I remind hon. Members that the pace of technological development is such that markets could be developed anywhere, and London has no divine right to be a central market place. London needs therefore to provide the most efficient and competitive market. That will not happen if any market can rely on a "need" criterion to give it an effective monopoly.<br><br>
It does not seem to me that either the Secretary of State or the agency should become involved in making decisions about the economic development of financial services markets. That assumes that the Government or agency know what is best for the markets. Those are matters which should be left to market forces, subject to ensuring adequate investor protection. That is the proper role for the agency, and the Bill gives it the flexible but tough powers that it needs for that purpose.<br><br>
Although I do not wish to engage in a historical argument with the hon. Member for Dagenham, I do not think that he is right to say that some of the changes that he proposed earlier and which we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
resisted would allow the agency to direct an investment business towards a particular SRO. He suggested that that was in some way linked with the possibility of developing investment exchanges in a way that might be undesirable and threaten existing institutions such as the stock exchange.<br><br>
That danger would be likely to arise only if the kind of investment businesses to which he referred got together to form an investment exchange access to which was denied to other investment businesses. If access to the investment exchange were not denied to other such businesses, the difficulties and dangers would surely not arise.<br><br>
In due course we shall consider the role of the director general of fair trading in relation to competition as it affects the Bill. However, it would be part of his remit to ensure that investment exchanges would not act in an anti-competitive fashion, and so give some investment businesses an undesirable preferred position in the market place.<br><br>
I have every confidence in the stock exchange's ability to compete effectively and continue to offer the services that it has offered so effectively for so long. The hon. Member for Dagenham is right to pay tribute to the stock exchange's record on regulation. That record could be enhanced in future, perhaps to some extent in the light of the Bill. I do not see that the stock exchange has any reasonable fear along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to discuss market development in relation to recognised investment exchanges, and my earlier point about the galaxy or the black hole. Last night, at short notice, I had the opportunity of talking to a vice-president of the New York stock exchange—someone whom I am sure would have clear views on the Bill. He had flown over from America specifically to discuss the matter.<br><br>
As the discussion was at short notice, I have had no opportunity to discuss it with the Minister, and the New York stock exchange has not had the opportunity to discuss the matter with anyone other than the SIB. I hope that that will be resolved. No doubt the Minister will want to inform himself on those questions. Certainly the exchange is seeking advice at the moment from an appropriate quarter. We wish to know how the New York stock exchange and similar exchanges in America or elsewhere fit in with clauses 35 and 36 and schedule 3 in particular. It has its own rules and is well established. Organisations of such a size need a clear picture as to how, domestically in the United States or perhaps elsewhere in relation to other stock exchanges, they could tailor their domestic needs to the requirements of the Bill.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It was put to me clearly that the New York stock exchange wanted to participate actively in the galaxy that I hope we shall generate in market development. Equally, if there are insuperable difficulties they will have to be considered before Report stage.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
I have no brief on the vice president's views. They arose in a short discussion before I went on a speaking engagement. The vice-president raised, among other issues, the question of civil immunity. It is prudent to say no more now, because I am sure that the Minister will want to be fully informed. The New York stock exchange is taking legal advice from an extremely good stable and I believe that it will then be able to put a brief to the Minister. If, after mature reflection, the Minister identifies matters that could be discussed with the New York stock exchange or other bodies, he will want to take them into account before Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo <span class='memberconstituency'> (Suffolk, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to hear what my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary says in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).<br><br>
I listened carefully to what my hon. and learned Friend said about the amendment, but I was not entirely persuaded by his arguments. There is genuine ground for concern about we possible adverse consequences of a fragmentation of markets. Inevitably, if more markets dealing in the same securities are created, there will be a reduction in the liquidity of the markets, or of the leading markets as sections of trading are fragmented into other markets.<br><br>
A consequence will be an increase in dealing costs. Spreads will widen and perhaps other charges will increase. That increase will be against the interests of investors, but perhaps not in a way that will merit the investor protection grounds for rejecting a new applicant for recognised investment exchange status. Will my hon. and learned Friend say a little more about those circumstances?<br><br>
With more fragmentation of markets and a reduction in liquidity the risk of price rigging and price manipulation will increase substantially. That risk may be covered by the investor protection provisions but there are grounds for concern, which is why I sympathise with the thrust of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply to my opening remarks and to the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) for his comments.<br><br>
I assumed that the Minister would place some reliance on the word " may" in clause 36(3). I thought that he might say mat, on the face of it, the provision gave the Secretary of State and the designated agency the flexibility to take account of something approaching a needs criterion. The Minister made precisely that argument on clause 18 covering recognised professional bodies when I moved an amendment in the opposite direction to replace "may" by "shall". Then, the Minister argued mat the word " may " was required so that the Secretary of State or the designated agency could take account of a needs criterion, although it was not specified in the Bill.<br><br>
If the Minister had advanced that argument today, I should have listened sympathetically because it would meet my concern, and I am slightly puzzled about why he did not. However, the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
comments allow me to re-emphasise a matter that is perfectly clear but which the Minister did not perhaps give full weight.<br><br>
I am not suggesting a mandatory provision. We are not saying that where there are competing or conflicting markets recognition shall not be granted. We propose that, in appropriate circumstances, it may be useful for the designated agency to have that reserve power on the ground of investor protection.<br><br>
I follow the line of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South. It it not just my puny authority behind the proposition, but the experience and expertise of those who will have to administer the system. SIB also fears that if there were to be a proliferation of markets, the investor would lose out because investor protection would be reduced.<br><br>
That may not be so in most cases so we would not need to use the power. However, there may be cases where it would be in the interests of effective regulation to be able to say, "No, I am sorry. You meet all the other criteria, but there is already an adequate market operating here and the introduction of yet another one may so affect the liquidity of the market that the investor would lose out."<br><br>
My point about the likelihood of financial conglomerates seeking direct authorisation as a means of escaping the complexity of having to join a succession of SROs was, I agree, only tenuously relevant. But it is part of a rather alarming scenario in which major players in the market may, for their own reasons, decide not to take the route of SROs, and may decide to seek direct authorisation. It would be extraordinarily difficult to refuse that to, for example, Citibank.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's point about exclusivity of access to markets, but those institutions may nevertheless set up a market in which they are the major players and then seek under these provisions recognition as an investment exchange. That would strike a blow at the stock exchange. Bearing in mind the Minister's earlier strictures, I shall not repeat the argument, but I do not belive that he dealt adequately with that.<br><br>
The stock exchange is worried about the threat; its position has been substantially weakened—perhaps as a consequence of a lack of foresight on its own part—compared with its position of three years ago, when it was the SRO and the recognised investment exchange all in one, and it had absolute control over admission to those bodies. If the stock exchange is to lose all those powers bit by bit, it is in greater danger of being undermined.<br><br>
I was interested in the issue raised by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), because many of us will have seen reports about the role that the New York stock exchange may seek to play in those matters- That may not be strictly relevant, but it gives the Minister an opportunity to give us his reaction to those reports.<br><br>
The provisions as drafted give precious few powers to the designated agency to resist applications for authorisation or for recognition under various heads from a party such as the New York stock exchange.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
It could not be said that it does not regulate its markets adequately. It is difficult to see how it could be excluded. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I thought that the absence of the power that would be provided by the amendment would lead to any diminution of investor protection, I should readily accept the amendment. The matter has caused me some anxiety, and I have given it a good deal of consideration, but I have concluded that there are no investor-protection grounds for providing such a power.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) have suggested that fragmentation of the markets may lead to higher dealing costs. The relationship between investment exchanges dealing in similar investment products will, in essence, be a competitive one, which is likely to have the net effect of lowering the costs—certainly in anything other than the short-run—and one would expect dealings to be concentrated in the most efficient and cost effective investment exchange. So it would not be desirable to introduce the provision. The fears that have been expressed are misplaced. The absence of the proposed power will not lead to any serious difficulties.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) says about any subject, " It would be wise to say no more", it is a foolish man indeed who ignores that advice and ventures an observation, He said that the matter of the New York Stock Exchange merits consideration. I am happy to agree with him. The New York Stock Exchange is in touch with the Department for Trade and Industry. I visited it in November and discussed various matters, but it did not raise the matter to which my hon. Friend referred. I should not like to be drawn on that matter now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what my hon. and learned Friend said, one could argue that in the Stock Exchange—a highly liquid single market— dealing costs are already substantially higher for small investors.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggested that there could be some large players in the market whom: the SIB might authorise directly, and that they might get together and apply to the SIB to form a recognised investment exchange. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Citibank, and it could also include the new Morgan Grenfell-Exco.<br><br>
Those companies would use their recognised investment exchange to make deals for their large customers, such as pension fund portfolios. If one asked to sell 1,000 British Telecom shares to a Citibank pension fund department, one would be told to use that perfectly good market, the Stock Exchange. Such a development would make dealing on the Stock Exchange significantly more costly than if all the business were going through the same market.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend made the point about competition between the markets. That would keep mid-market prices in line, but if there were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
one market for big deals and one—which might be the stock exchange—for smaller deals, the small investor would be disadvantaged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). He has elaborated the point that I wished to make. The picture that he has painted should worry the Committee.<br><br>
I take the Minister's point about the fair trading provisions, which may protect against that development. However, it is still worrying.<br><br>
After the dramatic entrance staged by the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson), I do not want to prolong the debate. I hope that the Minister will further consider the issues, which are genuinely worrying. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNITION OF INVESTMENT EXCHANGE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 137, line 19, leave out "is a proper market" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"are properly conducted market arrangements:".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, desigfined to ask the Minister whether the phrase "proper market" in paragraph 2 (2) (a) is meant to refer to the range of factors that might define a market, including the liquidity of the market, or whether it is directed at the regulation of the market.<br><br>
I accept that the two cannot be entirely separated—one may influence the other—but the draftsman's intention seems to focus on the effectiveness of the regulation of the market to provide investor protection. The phrase is not meant to strike at markets that are relatively illiquid and where the volume of business is small, otherwise bargains in such illiquid stocks might be driven up market because they could not take place within a recognised investment exchange. Can the Minister say what "proper market" is meant to achieve in this context?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dunk that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) anticipated my response when he posed the alternative interpresetations of the phrase "proper market" and conceded that they could not be entirely separated. The answer is that both the hon. Gentleman's alternatives are contemplated within the mean of the phrase.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned liquidity. The requirement that there must be a proper market does not mean that there must be frequent or day-to-day dealings. It means only that there must be a properly regulated two-way market in which the investment can be bought and sold at a fair price, sub-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
ject to proper safeguards, even if dealings take place only at intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He has gone some way to meeting my argument, although I am not confident that he has gone all the way towards meeting the point of those outside the Committee who are interested in the amendment. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the Minister's remarks and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 138, line 13, after " willing ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>" through its arrangements and rules, including those concerning admission, financial supervision and disciplinary procedures ".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is even more probing and speculative than the previous one and I can predict the Minister's likely response with even greater certainty.<br><br>
The point of the amendment lies in governing admission to the investment exchange. It seeks to restore to the stock exchange, and to any other body that runs a recognised investment exchange, the right to govern access to that market.<br><br>
From the Minister's earlier remarks I imagine that that is the antithesis of what he is seeking to achieve in opening up competition in this area. Does he place any weight on or give any credence to, the considerable worries of the stock exchange about the loss of a power that it has enjoyed in the past? Clearly the stock exchange will lose that power under the provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the amendment is necessary to achieve the objective of being able to refuse access to a recognised investment exchange to anyone who does not, or is unlikely to, uphold high standards. It has been pointed out in the debate that there is no equivalent for investment exchanges of the " fit and proper " test for membership of an SRO. That is because investment exchanges may take many forms, from the traditional exchanges such as the stock exchange, to the newer commodity and financial futures exchanges and the exchanges of the future yet to come, which may be entirely computer based and provide no physical market place.<br><br>
Arrangements for access to exchanges will also vary from exchange to exchange, as will their arrangements for ensuring the performance of transactions effected on the exchange. In some cases, only members of the exchange will be allowed to deal on it; in other cases, there will be a contract between the exchange and users. The schedule needs to cover all the possibilities and that is why it is written in general terms so that they are relevant to a wide variety of different arrangements while still providing specified safeguards for investors and promoting high standards.<br><br>
A "fit and proper" membership test may not be appropriate in all cases because there may be no members. Disciplinary procedures may not be relevant when conditions for use of an exchange are laid down in contracts with users. There should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
vetting of those who use the facilities of the exchange, rules about the conduct of business on the exchange, and the power to refuse access, or expel or exclude anyone who is not prepared to observe those rules. The requirements of schedule 3 will not be met unless paragraph 2(1) of the schedule provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"The rules and practices of the exchange must ensure that business conducted by means of its facilities is conducted in an orderly manner and so as to afford proper protection to investors."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3(1) also contains requirements in respect of that matter. As I have explained, those requirements are in general terms to cover all types of exchange, but they would certainly cover the matters that I have discussed.<br><br>
I do not, therefore, consider that the amendment is necessary for the purpose for which it has been proposed. On the other hand, it would limit the scope of paragraph 5. The paragraph does not specify the ways in which the exchange must show its ability and willingness to promote and maintain high standards. That is left at large. The amendment would restrict the requirement to doing so through "arrangements and rules". That would have a narrowing effect, which I am sure is not the intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tabled an amendment which covers some of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I have already raised the matter with the Minister, and I do not intend to press it, but the test of competence is important and should be adjoined to integrity and fair dealing. I am confident that the Minister will take account of the matter, and, therefore, do not wish to press the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am content with the Minister's comments and therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>On proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary about membership of an investment exchange- He said that the schedule does not refer to membership because there may be no membership. As I understand it, membership of an investment exchange will not confer authorisation as an investment business, but how can we prevent an investment exchange, with members, arbitrarily refusing to recognise a firm, which is an authorised investment business?<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary may have seen the recent report of the London International Financial Futures Exchange about the application of LHW Futures to join the exchange. It gave two reasons for refusing membership to LHW. The first was that,
<br><blockquote><p>"LHW are less than fully successful in assessing the suitability of their recommendations to the individual clients to whom they are made ".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
That is perfectly legimate because it involves the conduct of business rules; schedule 6 refers to a rule in similar terms.<br><br>
The second reason was that the exchange alleged that its reputation would suffer if LHW were allowed to join. As I understand it, the exchange will not be an SRO, although the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers will be. The exchange may become a recognised investment exchange, but will there be any measures to prevent such an exchange arbitrarily refusing membership to an organisation, which has already secured authorisation by another route?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already raised that point about LHW. In an article in <i>The Times,</i> Mr. Michael Prest explains the unfortunate circumstances that have arisen in that case. It may be appropriate to express our regret at the recent death of Sir Anthony Rawlinson, as a result of a climbing accident last week, because the article referred to him.<br><br>
It is essential that the rules are devised and conducted to ensure that we do not have cosy clubs. If a blackballing operation might be conducted— because an organisation does not like the cut of a chap's cloth, for example, as the article suggested —arrangements must be made to ensure, through new clause 12 and other powers in the Bill, available to SIB and others, that a reasonable test is applied to membership of exchanges so that the business is conducted on the proper principles of fairness and natural justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the contribution of my hon. Friend, but I should make it clear that I am not questioning the decision taken in that case. I think that me first reason given was legitimate, and anyway, LHW has recently been investigated by the fraud squad in response to complaints from investors- I am not questioning the decision, but I am questioning the second reason given—that LIFFE's reputation would suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question asked by my hon Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) lies in the powers that we shall examine later that will repose in the director general of fair trading who will have a wide remit to consider such matters. Any attempt to limit access to a registered investment exchange on arbitrary grounds would no doubt be something that the director general would investigate and act upon.<br><br>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr Cash) is not wholly satisfied with those arrangements, and may have his own views on how best to secure the same objectives. While I am on my feet, Sir Michael, may I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford about Sir Anthony Rawlinson whose tragic death at the end of last week we noted with such sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your indulgence, Sir Michael, may I probe the mind of my hon. and learned Friend about my starred amendment No. 228 which was not selected for debate? I was seeking in that

amendment to highlight the difference in the ways that exchanges seek the enforcement of bargains.<br><br>
For example, the International Commodities Clearing House, itself stands behind each bargain and enforces its performance. On the Stock Exchange, on the other hand, the practice is to ensure that the parties to each bargain fulfil their contract.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 of schedule 3 suggests that the Bill will provide that the way in which the International Commodities Clearing House, for example, stands in relation to each bargain will be required of other exchanges, That will mean considerable changes in the procedure of, for example, the Stock Exchange in the conduct of its business. Is that the intention of my hon. and learned Friend, or is he seeking to bring forward changes on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our view is that the wording covers both kinds of arrangements referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), but we shall look at it again if it is thought that the wording is defective.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 221, in page 25, line 28, before " The " insert " (1) ".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 222, in page 25, line 32, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The exemption granted by subsection (1) of this section shall cease to have effect one year after this section comes into force, unless prior thereto an order for its continuance shall have been made by the Secretary of State and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Sir Michael, for selecting the amendment. For fear that any aspersions should be cast on the excellent staff of the House or on the Committee Clerks, I take an element of personal responsibility for the fact that the amendment may have inadvertently appeared starred. I tabled it as late as possible on Friday and it might have been wiser of me and fairer on the staff who serve us if I had tabled it earlier, as I shall in future.<br><br>
This is, in a sense, one of the central portions of the Bill and covers the question whether Lloyd's should be incorporated into the Bill and, if so, in what form. The amendment seeks to carry into legislation the gist of my speech on Second Reading, when I said that my first reaction was to include Lloyd's and all that goes on in Lloyd's, but that I was prepared to consider the matter with an open mind and to listen to the Government's intentions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
I accept that placing Lloyd's directly within the ambit of the Bill might produce considerable problems. The amendment would provide a year's grace in which to consider the results of the Government's inquiry. After that year, Parliament could decide to bring Lloyd's within the ambit of the Bill. I have several reasons for that view. I shall first examine Lloyd's and a reason that concerns all hon. Members and which has received a good deal of publicity in the national press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Following the helpful words of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr Ashdown), I must make it clear that although this is a fairly narrow amendment, we must stick to it. Otherwise we shall merge into a general debate—not that the hon. Member for Yeovil has sought to do so— which will be more appropriate in a clause stand part debate. If we clearly define this important amendment in our remarks we can have a more fruitful general debate on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek only to explain why it may subsequently be necessary to draw Lloyd's within the Bill, and why I tabled an amendment that might bring Lloyd's within the Bill in due course. I can be brief and I do not wish to undercut other hon. Member's more dramatic statements. I can approach the amendment on a factual basis.<br><br>
I want the option to consider the matter in due course because it is important. Huge sums are involved. Lloyd's global accounts for 31 December 1984 covering all classes combined show that the investment capital profits of Lloyd's were £314 million in 1982 and that investment income was £128 million. I understand that those are the profits available to names of Lloyd's from syndicate funds that are held and invested by Lloyd's agency companies.<br><br>
The accounts listed under security, financial facts, show that the premium trust fund for Lloyd's was £6,724 million in 1984—£150 for every man, woman and child in Britain. The personal special reserve funds are £443 million, and are the property of names, invested on behalf of names and on the instruction of names.<br><br>
I and other people wish to discover whether the Lloyd's Act 1982 will be sufficient or whether, as a result of current investigations at Lloyd's the Government intend to take action to make the Act sufficient. The amendment is designed to ensure that if there is no provision to make the 1982 Act sufficient, we shall draw Lloyd's within the Bill.<br><br>
Let us take as an example the personal and special reserve funds. Currently they are not required to receive an audit except at the end of the year; there is no on-going oversight on the operation of those funds. Moreover, the special reserve fund is the most tightly monitored of all. All other funds, including the profits from managing agents which are held by members' agents while waiting to be handed over to names, are not subject to any direct, specific, outside audit. Given those facts and the special circumstances in Lloyd's where names

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
have unlimited liability—a liability that has come home to roost in a big way in the PCW and other scandals—it may not be appropriate to be satisfied with the 1982 Act.<br><br>
I shall explain why there is some question about that. The House will have to make a judgement in a year's time if my amendment is accepted. That is why we should be able to look at it at a specific time in the future. I believe that the 1982 Act may prove to be inadequate unless the Government take action to strengthen it in the year's grace that my amendment would give them. The incident surrounding the Hay Davison affair is an example of that. The council of Lloyd's under its present constitution is composed entirely of working names and so it must have a vested interest in the decisions taken. There is no lay element in it. Rollover insurances show that some working names on the council of Lloyd's have been involved in schemes that subsequently have proved to be rather dubious. So, in that sense, the 1982 Act is insufficient unless it is strengthened in the year's grace given by my amendment.<br><br>
There is also the question of the baby syndicates and what has happened there. Steps have been taken to overcome that problem but they have been undertaken very late. Moreover, Lloyd's may make further developments. Lloyd's is very complex and is developing new ideas, and new dodges and wheezes. Would the 1982 Act provide a sufficient mechanism to keep pace with the new instruments available to Lloyd's to take advantage of the market place? We must decide whether the 1982 Act, which is essentially a static Act, is sufficient to take them into account or whether we need to establish an independent body.<br><br>
One matter that must be considered after a year is whether the present system, in which no one has the power to insist that Lloyd's or other parties carry out investigations as a result of complaints, should be allowed to persist after that year. Many believe that that has acted as a block on timely investigations into problem areas. The only force that can now move the council of Lloyd's to take action on complaints is the force of public and market opinion, though we suspect that a resolute chairman and council in support could block even that.<br><br>
Those are current inadequacies in the 1982 Act. The PCW and other scandals may have taken place before the 1982 Act came into operation, although there is still anxiety that such activity continues, albeit in a covert and undiscovered manner. Nevertheless, one significant aspect that has come to light—we shall see whether the Government take account of it—is whether the investigating mechanisms of the 1982 Act are sufficient. The names who have suffered in the PCW scandal do not think that they are. I agree with them.<br><br>
Although the scandals may have occurred before the 1982 Act came into operation, the inadequacies of the investigation and prosecution mechanisms are the inadequacies that are enshrined in the Act.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know that the inadequacies of the investigating procedures flow from the 1982 Act? He tells us that all the difficulties to which he has referred arose before the Act was on the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that, although the difficulties occurred before 1982, such safeguards that are in the Act should be available, for example, to the PCW names. Lloyd's has been dilatory in carrying out proper investigations. Prosecutions have been brought only when legal action has been threatened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Gentleman disagrees. If he spoke to any of the PCW names who have been seriously affected, he would discover that there is considerable dissatisfaction with the resources that are available to Lloyd's to investigate and prosecute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is getting into a general discussion about whether or not Lloyd's should be included. We are approaching the clause stand part debate. For now we must restrain ourselves to the single issue of the year's grace, as the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) described it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the matters will be brought up in more detail in the clause stand part debate.<br><br>
There are various questions that we should consider in the light of the inquiry during the year's grace that the amendment would give. We should consider whether the Government should institute an enforcement agency independent of Lloyd's bureaucracy to manage and oversee Lloyd's activities. The Bill would provide such a mechanism through the SIB, but the Government may seek to provide it by amending the 1982 Act in the light of the inquiry in the first year.<br><br>
We should consider whether the Government should institute a system to make spot checks on agency and broker companies to ensure that they are abiding by their long-standing requirements and byelaws, whether the system of investigating allegations of malpractice and fraud from the auditors will be sufficient to cope with the problems, whether there is sufficient power to ensure that the byelaws are observed and are adequate to manage the market, and whether a supervising body independent of Lloyd's bureaucracy would clearly establish accountability.<br><br>
As there is widespread worry, the question is whether we should bring Lloyd's within the ambit of the Bill, although that is a matter for the clause stand part debate. Perhaps it should not be brought within the Bill. It may be the triumph of hope over experience, but we must give the Government the benefit of the doubt, as they have set up the Sir Patrick Neill inquiry.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
I am worried by some of the comments of the Secretary of State, which suggested that the inquiry may find that everything is all right, and that there is no need for changes. The amendment expresses the view that the aim of the Neill inquiry should be to decide not whether something needs to be done to the 1982 Act, but what needs to be done.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm whether he has received a letter from the Association of Lloyd's Members which states clearly that they do not think that any of that is necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: were it not out of order, I should love to refer to that. I shall do so on clause stand part, as some powerful points need to be made about the letter and about the speech of the chairman of Lloyd's, Peter Miller, which was shot through with inadequacy and in certain cases with arrogance too. I reiterate that our approach to the Neill inquiry is not whether something should be done to the 1982 Act, to enforce proper supervision of Lloyd's, but what needs to be done. The purpose of the amendment is to give the Government a chance to ensure that something is done.<br><br>
The Labour party will no doubt ask why I do not seek to encompass Lloyd's in the first instance in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that I shall attempt to make such a case. I understood that the purpose of his persistent but unsuccessful amendments to schedule 1 was to achieve the very objective from which he has now departed. Why has the hon. Gentleman, as the official spokesman of the Liberal party, backed off?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is perfectly clear. I said clearly on Second Reading that my first instinct was to bring Lloyd's within the Bill, but that I was prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and see what happened with the Neill inquiry.<br><br>
I move the amendments as probing amendments —as the hon. Gentleman has done on many occasions—to discover the Government's view on the matter and to extend the range of the debate as far as possible.<br><br>
It is sad that we have only this debate in which to concentrate on the Lloyd's issue, as I would have wished to have two or three bites of the cherry. The hon. Gentleman knows that well, as he and I discussed the matter and I explained in private what I thought clearly to him then.—[Hon. Members "Oh!"] I should tell Conservative Members that I occasionally have private conversations with some of them too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Recently I asked on the Floor of the House whether it was a convention of the House that hon. Members do not refer to private conversations either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. If it were not, we would be devastated.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be better if the Committee returned strictly to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has referred to private conversations, I should explain that in my private conversation with him I sought to explain why his amendments were wrongly drafted and so outside the ambit of the Bill—I was delighted you thought so, too, Sir Michael—and my strong view that the appropriate moment for debating this issue was on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would deprecate myself being drawn into any arguments on the matter. Let us stick to what is a narrow amendment. I sense that it is the Committee's wish to get on as quickly as possible to the main debate on clause 40.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of straying outside the narrow ambit of the proposal, and I have kept my comments tightly within it. However, for me this is the main issue. Although for tactical reasons one might wish to listen and participate in the later debate, I do not wish to draw Lloyd's lock, stock and barrel and willy-nilly within the Bill, for reasons I shall explain.<br><br>
I may be a single voice on the Committee, but for me this is the central issue. What we propose is what we would like to see happen, as I said on Second Reading. It should not come as a surprise to anybody that I wish to discuss it now.<br><br>
I have as much right to have my views heard as anybody else here. Conservative Members may wish to move on to the clause stand part debate, but I wish to discuss what is, for me, the key issue here.<br><br>
Why do I not take the view which I am sure the Labour Members will advance, and which they adumbrated in pungent terms on Second Reading?<br><br>
First, I believe that the SIB will not have the resources to cope with Lloyd's. Second, I believe that an organisation will be created that will be hybrid in its character. Third, I believe that there may be some questions of hybridity in the Bill.<br><br>
In reaching those conclusions, I was impressed by the remarks made by Sir Kenneth Berrill at the conference on "Regulating of the Financial Services Industry" in which he stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"To bring Lloyd's within the scope of the financial services legislation would introduce a number of extremely difficult technical and practical problems for both Lloyd's and for my Board. Put briefly it would mean my Board acquiring the expertise to monitor an insurance market which is quite different from the markets in securities and commodities. Both organisations,"</p></blockquote>
—by which I presume he means Lloyd's and the SIB—
<br><blockquote><p>"have pretty full agendas at present. Before embarking on such a course"</p></blockquote>
—that is bringing Lloyd's under the SIB—
<br><blockquote><p>"we should, I believe, await the outcome of the enquiry to be undertaken by Sir Patrick Neill at the request of the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
I do not think that it would be possible to encompass the reason for the amendment more clearly than that statement does.<br><br>
There is considerable doubt about whether we shall be able to bring the SIB and all its attendant SROs into operation within the time scale that the Government have offered. To bring in Lloyd's now would ensure that such a prophecy would come to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the force of the general point made by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) about the fact that many of the SROs do not exist at present, so there may be substantial difficulties and delays. But surely it is perverse to apply that argument to Lloyd's, which already exists, has a substantial record of self-regulation and would seem to be eminently suited to becoming an SRO within the present structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be perverse to apply it to Lloyd's, but I have already stated why I believe that those self-regulatory functions of Lloyd's inadequate in the present circumstances. I believe that there would have to be changes indeed, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) would no doubt make a case for changes within the regulations of Lloyd's before it could be brought within the SIB. No doubt he would also say that unless it made certain changes, it would not be recognised.<br><br>
However, my case is not just the inadequacy of Lloyd's as an SRO—or, indeed, the fact that it is established—but rather that I believe that the SIB will be much tested by seeking to regulate even such SROs as would come within its ambit under the Bill as it stands.<br><br>
My point is that at the moment—and it may be the triumph of hope over experience—I agree with Sir Kenneth Berrill that it may not be practical to include Lloyd's under the Bill. But let the Government be in no doubt that they will have to change the 1982 Act to ensure that the supervision of Lloyd's is adequate for the present day and age.<br><br>
My amendment would give the Government a year in which to consider those matters, give us the chance to hear what Sir Patrick Neill will say, and ultimately give the House of Commons the right and ability to draw Lloyd's into the Bill if all other measures have failed and circumstances remain as inadequate as the present ones are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) for giving the benefit of the doubt to the Government, albeit in a rather ambidextrous—" on the one hand, one the other hand "—manner.<br><br>
For information, the hon. Gentleman was actually referring in his earlier comments to the committee of Lloyd's when he used the words " the council". He will of course know that the council has a broader mix of membership, involving working and external members.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister rightly makes that point, it may be helpful to note that one of those members is Sir Kenneth Berrill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Sir Kenneth Benin's view will be debated in some detail on clause stand-part.<br><br>
I accept that the amendment meets, in part, one of the arguments for the exemption: that is that the position of Lloyd's should not be prejudged before Sir Patrick Neill's inquiry has reported.<br><br>
The amendment does not, however, meet the argument about whether the Bill is an appropriate vehicle for protecting the interests of members of Lloyd's. I said that the amendment meets the question of prejudging Lloyd's only in part, because of the way that it shifts the onus of proof.<br><br>
Lloyd's already has a statutory system for protecting both names and policy holders which the Lloyd's Act 1982 began to put in place. The new and still developing, system has not been shown to be defective; and it is wrong to assume that it is defective unless and until the inquiry says otherwise.<br><br>
I do not think that the effect the amendment, which would leave the future of the regulation of Lloyd's in doubt even if the inquiry concludes that the present system is satisfactory, would be just. It would expose the Lloyd's market, quite unnecessarily, to a further period of uncertainty, for no purpose.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman says that if the inquiry finds that something needs to be done, the answer should be to apply the Bill to Lloyd's. However, the Government have made clear already, in comments from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Brittan) and others, our grave reservations about whether the Bill is an appropriate instrument, because of the separate need to provide for the protection of policy holders.<br><br>
I suspect that that is what the hon. Gentleman has referred to in public remarks as a tricky set of criteria to juxtapose; and which will exercise us in the debate about to take place.<br><br>
I should like to make the Government's position clear on the amendment. The Prime Minister said in the House just before Christmas that the Government are watching events at Lloyd's carefully and will not hesitate to take any action, including legislation where necessary. I hope that hon. Members will bear that in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why will the Government not give the House of Commons a say on this matter in a year's time? The Government have a majority in the Houseof Commons. All I ask is that we should review the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fencesitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that I am fencesitting. Occasional snide remarks have been made about, "on the one hand and on the other hand ". But that is right; that is how I believe that the politics of this country should be run,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
and how the Committee too should be run. We must attempt to use our brains and our rational faculties to come to conclusions about what should be done. The Committee and the House are ill-served by those who leave their brains outside the Chamber before they come in, and adopt their attitudes from their parties' manifestos. I am proud—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman; he will have his opportunity. I am proud to make judgments on these complex matters, by seeking, as others may not, to weigh up the issues and to reach some kind of rational conclusion. That is the appropriate way to approach the whole debate. I am sorry that the atmosphere, that has prevailed in the Committee under your
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
chairmanship, Sir Michael, seems to have been dispensed with by both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
Why will the Minister not give the House the opportunity to review this major issue of public concern in a year's time? He knows perfectly well that with its present majority the Government could push through what they want in a year's time. Is the Minister so confident that what is in the Bill is right, and that Lloyd's will not come up against further problems in the next year, that he is not prepared at least to have the matter reviewed by the House rather than closing his mind to any possibility of review or reform in the year to come? Could not some decision—no doubt the one that the Government wish—be taken in a year's time?</span></p>
