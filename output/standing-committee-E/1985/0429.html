<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service (Amendment) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the National Health Service (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—<i>[Mr. Hayhoe.]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek<span class='memberconstituency'> (Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that during our proceedings everybody will be expeditious, make their points succinctly and not repeat arguments ad nauseam. As the Bill comprises three distinct parts, three specific issues need to be considered in some detail. The Opposition will bring forward many items for proper and detailed examination, so that arguments which may have escaped the Ministers and their advisers can be considered. I hope that there will be a spirit of cooperation between both sides and that, if they are persuaded by our arguments, Ministers will see fit to make changes either later in our proceedings or on Report.<br><br>
The Opposition's amendments may be defective, they may be out of order and not selected, but we believe them to be important. I hope that morning sittings will suffice and that we shall not have to sit for too long.<br><br>
I shall now briefly run through some of the points that worry us. First—this may take some time— there is the question of food legislation. It is not as though the Government propose only to remove Crown immunity; they are also seeking to introduce the applicability of food legislation to hospital premises. We are not sure whether it will affect only the kitchens or also the corridors through which food will be moved to the patients, and we shall need time to explore the proposal in detail to understand exactly what the Government have in mind. After food is delivered by lorry to the hospital forecourt or somewhere, is it covered by food legislation or by hygiene legislation? If not, why not? Are the employees covered by health and safety at work legislation?<br><br>
The food then goes through a whole cycle in the hospital. As I understand it, the Bill seeks to protect hospital patients from bad practices and from food that is not fit to eat—and, of course, we all know what happened at the Stanley Royal hospital a few months ago. The food comes into the kitchens, where it has to be prepared and it is then taken to the patients who have to eat it. After it is eaten there arises the problem of what happens to the food chain thereafter—sewerage, and so on.<br><br>
I am not sure how the Bill will affect that food chain. It may take one or two sittings to discover exactly what goes on, and the Opposition have tabled some amendments for that purpose. Some of the amendments go beyond the original title of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Bill, and I see from the selection list that some of mine have not been selected. I accept that, but other ways are open to the Opposition to explore that topic, perhaps by amending the title and introducing new clauses later. Those are worries about clause 1. I hope that the Government can give explanations. Moreover, if the Government realise that there are defects in the clause, I hope that—I hope that we shall have the time—the Government will propose amendments to it.<br><br>
We shall need to take at least a sitting or two to discuss clause 2 which relates to the appeals machinery for pharmacists. Clause 2 is lengthy. It takes up more than three pages of the unusual paper on which Bills are printed and contains several subsections. Unfortunately, much of clause 2 is enabling legislation which I understand will allow the Minister to issue regulations that will be more specific and will introduce the pharmacists' charter. We may be giving the Minister too many powers, not only in clause 2, but in some of the other clauses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am in some difficulty in distinguishing between what it is legitimate to debate on the general motion and what it would be legitimate to discuss in a clause stand part debate that might take place laier I hope that the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) will address his remarks to the motion. I accept that he is perfectly in order in giving a brief outline as to why he thinks that the Committee will take so long or will be able to be confined within the time represented by the sittings motion, but I hope that he will not transgress too far into clause stand part debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Philip. I hope to do as you request. I am sure that you will pull me up again if I stray too far.<br><br>
I wish briefly to set out the areas of concern and relate them to the number of sittings we may wish to have. I foresee that we shall need between one and three sittings on clause 1, unless the Government can give satisfactory explanations, when the matter might be dispensed with in an hour or so.<br><br>
As for clause 2. I wish only to set out why we may need two or three sittings in which to debate it. There are three reasons why that much time might be needed. First, the clause is too generally drafted and it may allow too many powers to be made by regulation at a later stage. It is important for the House to be clear that it is giving such powers to the Minister. Moreover, if that is not clear, the Opposition should press the Minister to tighten the clause, which would take time, of course.<br><br>
Two other aspects of clause 2 are of particular interest to the public and especially to pharmacists. One is whether the appeals machinery should be national or local. At present, the Government intend it to be local. We shall need to take time on that issue at some stage to determine the Government's exact thinking. The other aspect relates to how many kilometres there must be between pharmacies. Should it be 2 kms or another distance—for example, only 1 km. There needs to be ample time to debate the detailed arguments. A sitting or part of a sitting might be necessary on that issue.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Clause 3 is the last major clause in the Bill. Although it is the optician's clause, it will possibly be applied to other professions. We shall need information from the Government about the clause.<br><br>
The Government gave certain undertakings on Second Reading for which we were thankful, so we shall not detain the Committee on those matters. However, money should not be taken from opticians who were overpaid on a general basis. Some opticians entered the service late who were not overpaid, so it would be unfair to take money from them. We shall discuss that problem in a later sitting.<br><br>
We need to tighten up the clause and make it more explicit, especially with regard to "different information". It is not clear what that "different information" could be; it is not specific.<br><br>
There may be a case for not having retrospective legislation, although it could be argued that clause 3 refers to retrospective functions. We shall discuss whether we want that sort of legislation or whether to begin from a "start from now" principle.<br><br>
The Opposition believe that there are important matters to be discussed. There are 53 amendments and one new clause on the amendment paper, although they may not all be selected. We want to be expeditious and I think that it is right to sit between 10.30 and one o'clock. I hope that the Bill will proceed in a spirit of co-operation in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maxton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I do not wish to delay our proceedings but I believe that it would be beneficial if we adjourned the Committee to allow the Government to change their Front Bench. It is not right, in a Bill that covers separate Scottish and English legislation, that there is no one from the Scottish Office on the Front Bench. The Bill will amend the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 and the National Health Service Act 1977.<br><br>
I doubt whether the two Ministers present have knowledge of the separate Scottish makeup of the Health Service or the existing legislation that will be affected by the Bill. The Government should consider whether to adjourn the Committee so that there could be a motion on the Order Paper tomorrow replacing one of the Ministers with the health Minister from Scotland, who would be able to talk confidently—I do not mean that he would have too much confidence as I know the Minister involved. He would not be that good but he would be an improvement.<br><br>
In Committee proceedings, it is normal for the Government to ensure that copies of the primary legislation which is being amended are available to Committee members in the Committee Room. At present, neither the 1977 or the 1978 Acts are on the Table. It is sometimes difficult for us to obtain copies of such Acts from the Table Office because the Government often have the only copies that are left. They seem to have a great capacity for saving some public money by stopping the publication of Acts after a specific time and not bothering to have them republished. Therefore, Committee members are put in difficulty.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
It is normal for such documents to be available. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
request again that the Committee adjourns until Thursday morning so that they can be made available to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the honourable Gentleman was not proposing a motion to adjourn. Therefore, it is not a matter for me. The question of other legislation being available in the Committee Room for Committee members is also not a matter for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings of the National Health Service (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
APPLICATION OF FOOD LEGISLATION TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH SERVICE PREMISES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call amendment No. 7, I remind the Committee that copies of the financial resolution in respect of the Bill are available in the Room. Adequate notice must be given to amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript or starred amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson (Holborn and St. Pancras)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, line 14, leave out 'in' and insert 'to extend'.<br><br>
Clause <i>1(2) (b)</i> goes to the heart of the proposition announced by the Government when they said they were accepting the disappearance of Crown immunity from hospital kitchens. I believe that nearly everyone welcomed that decision, but under the Bill as drafted, there is a great danger that the good intentions of the Government would be immediately undermined. Subsection <i>(2)(b)</i> seeks to
<br><blockquote><p>"make such modifications of the food legislation, in its application to health authorities, as appear to the authority to be appropriate",</p></blockquote>
which made me ponder who the authority would be. As you, Sir Philip, were in the Chair, I even wondered whether a quango had been invented for such a role.<br><br>
However, the next page of the Bill shows that the appropriate authority would be no other than the Ministers. When Ministers introduce a Bill that imposes obligations on them and then take unto themselves the right to set aside those obligations when it appear to be appropriate, we must look more carefully at the proposals.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to ensure that the modifications that the Ministers might make would only apply in one direction. The amendment would introduce a sort of legislative ratchet in that they could extend the food regulations in respect of hospitals, but could not retract them. We think that that is wholly appropriate.<br><br>
I do not wish to enter a premature debate on amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10, but they intend to identify certain shortcomings in the existing food hygiene regulations which will still leave hospital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
kitchens subject to various problems. For instance, pigeons in the kitchens of Charing Cross hospital will not be subject to the legislation unless it is specifically extended to include them. While the present, inadequate food hygiene regulations need to be modified, they should be modified only by way of extension rather than by chopping out embarrassing bits that are difficult or expensive to implement.<br><br>
What will the Minister bear in mind when he decides whether something is or is not appropriate? The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum explains that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 has no implications for public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
We know that money needs to be spent on some hospital kitchens that are a stinking mess, and it is difficult to believe that such expenditure will have no implications for public expenditure.<br><br>
The only way that such costs would not have implications for public expenditure is if the Minister exercised his powers under subsection <i>(2)(b)</i> and made modifications because the money was not available. That is not in line with the general proposition that the Government claim to have accepted when they said that they were willing to lift Crown immunity from hospital kitchens.<br><br>
The Minister may say that all sorts of unforeseen difficulties may arise if the legislation is to apply to Health Service kitchens. But unspecified, unforeseen, and apparently unforeseeable difficulties should not be used as an excuse to give the Minister such sweeping powers that will allow him to set aside the main provision in this part of the Bill. What sort of unforeseen difficulties have his advisers suggested justify him taking those powers? If such difficulties are unforeseen and unforeseeable, they are usually dealt with when they arise. That is how such difficulties should be dealt with in this case.<br><br>
To what extent can clause 1 be applied? It is not clear to me, but that is probably a shortcoming on my part rather than on the part of the parliamentary draftsmen. Can the Minister say whether the lifting of Crown immunity in respect of food hygiene, unmodified by the Minister, applies only to food in hospital kitchens? Will it apply to food when it is brought in to be used in the kitchens? Will it apply to food after it is cooked and when it is taken to a ward or to a nurses' home? Will it apply when food is on the ward and in the nurses' home? Will it apply to food that is left over and uneaten in the ward, the nurses' home or in the surgeons' mess? Will the measure cover all those circumstances or will it apply only to hospital kitchens?<br><br>
If lifting Crown immunity will apply only to hospital kitchens, substantial applications in the process of new food techniques will not be covered—for example, cook and freeze methods where food may be kept in a freezer which is not in the hospital kitchen. Will the food hygiene legislation apply to that? Will the legislation apply to food that is prepared by one hospital kitchen for a group of hospitals and which is stored off the premises where it is cooked or where it will be eaten?<br><br>
It is absurd to say that we wish the rigours of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
food hygiene regulations to be applied to food while it is being cooked in a kitchen but that once it is on a trolley going to a ward, a staff residence, and so on these rigours will no longer apply. The general idea is for the food to be healthy and not to undermine the health of patients, staff or, presumably, the occasional visitor. Our objective is to ensure that the food is safe.<br><br>
We want an assurance from the Minister that the unmodified application of the food hygiene regulations in clause 1 will cover all those circumstances. If not, what was trumpeted forth in the House about the regulations will not be wholly true.<br><br>
The main point of amendment No. 7 is that subsection <i>2(b)</i> could be applied to undermine and dispense with the admirable decision taken by the Government to apply food hygiene regulations. Opposition Members are not satisfied to leave in the clause the wording,
<br><blockquote><p>"make such modifications of the food legislation … as appear to the authority to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
If the DHSS suddenly finds that the health budget is skint, it may find it inappropriate to apply the full rigours of food hygiene legislation.<br><br>
Is this a general power? Will those modifications apply generally to all National Health Service premises? The present unrestricted powers sought by the Minister will allow him to say, "'Well we notice that it will cost £680,000 to do up the kitchens of Stanley Royd. The Yorkshire health authority don't have the money and so we will modify the application of regulations to Stanley Royd hospital, Wakefield."<br><br>
A general power is fairly unacceptable, but to leave the Minister with the power to modify the application of the legislation to premises in a certain health district, in one country—Scotland—or those within a health region is more unsatisfactory than the general power. It will be recalled that some of our ancestors went to considerable lengths to minimise the dispensing powers of Governments.<br><br>
Our amendment seeks to modify the clause to prevent the Government having the power to find something "appropriate"—which usually means something inconvenient—to dispense with the basic proposition of the Bill. We look forward to the Minister's explanation of what he and his colleagues are up to in this respect and, providing we receive solid assurances, we may be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to support my honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and to underline everything he said. At the same time, I should like to know more from the Minister about the scope of subsection <i>(2)(b),</i> because I am profoundly suspicious of its intention.<br><br>
Like my honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, I shall listen carefully to the Minister's explanation, but at present I have forebodings for the obvious reason that it has taken a long time for the Crown immunity for hospital catering to come about. Frankly, clause 1 is long overdue. The fact that there has been much dragging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
of feet because of the potential cost of implementing this legislation makes one justified in saying that the Government will be looking for an opportunity to minimise their commitment. I hope that that suspicion is unfounded. We shall know when the Minister replies.<br><br>
I have some reservation about the form of the amendment. At first sight, I should have preferred to have kicked the whole thing into touch and scrubbed subsection <i>2(b)</i> altogether. I do not know the reason for it. I suspect that it is to evade the obligation and I should like to see it deleted. But I accept the explanation of my honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras for leaving out "in" and inserting "to extend", who said that the words would have a ratchet effect on the proposition—that they would turn things one way so that the regulations could be extended but not diluted.<br><br>
In other words, the amendment seeks to ensure that the whole thing can go forwards and not backwards. I hope that my honourable Friend has got it right. I hope that the amendment will act as a ratchet and that we have taken no risks with it. I also understand that the following three amendments hinge on the wording of Amendment No. 7. I hope so. I take my honourable Friend's advice on these matters, but I am suspicious about subsection (2)(b).<br><br>
The Bill had a successful Second Reading on 15 April when everyone agreed that it was necessary, welcome and overdue. Therefore, we start from a consensus about the Bill's intentions. A strong case for the clause was made by the Minister on Second Reading. Some of his remarks were unexceptionable.<br><br>
Hospital patients are more prone to the dangers of infection, so we would expect hospital kitchens to set a standard for kitchens everywhere. However, the reverse is true. Hospital kitchens not only lag behind private establishments but do not reach general hygiene standards.<br><br>
The Minister and the Secretary of State expressed anxiety about the critical reports on hospital kitchens. There is no need to cite the vivid and lurid detail that appeared in the press. Some of those articles were like something from a penny dreadful. Unfortunately, it was accurate reporting. Such occurrences in the National Health Service are not only matters for critical note but disgraceful.<br><br>
Much hinges on clause 1 so we must examine it carefully. It refers to Crown immunity being removed from hospital catering, and the Government have attacked the problem by making hospital kitchens liable to the provisions of the Food Act 1984 and associated regulations.<br><br>
In fairness, the Minister said that that was not the complete answer to the problem. While the clause alters the legal relationships, it is important to establish a system of inspection so that we can make an inroad into the problems.<br><br>
Subsection <i>(2)(b)</i> is especially disappointing. We have not heard from the Minister but I hope that we shall be given a complete reassurance. We must examine the wording and consider whether it will open the gate to abuse. Subsection <i>(2)(b)</i> states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"makes such modifications"—</p></blockquote>
that means dilution—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the food legislation, in its application to health authorities, as appear to the authority to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
We could wheel a coach and four through that wording.<br><br>
What modifications do the Government have in mind? Will the Minister tell us some of the options centred round the word "appropriate". What is appropriate and in what circumstances?<br><br>
I thank the Minister and his Department for providing us with notes on clauses. Someone has done much work, and they are very helpful. The notes on subsection <i>(2)(b)</i> suggest that the power is needed to enable modifications to be made in future if unforeseen difficulties arise in the application and interpretation of the food legislation. That is another gate through which a coach and four could go.<br><br>
Does not the subsection give the authorities responsible for administering the legislation power to evade the spirit and intentions of the whole clause? It reads that way to me. It seems that the Minister was strong on philosophy on Second Reading, but a bit short on practice when we consider the text of the clause. Outside observers believe that too. For example, the Consumers Association suggests that it may be a way of reintroducing Crown immunity by the back door.<br><br>
There is much at stake in clause 1, which refers to matters that are long overdue. There should be no ifs or buts. The Bill should be applied straight down the line, so I support my honourable Friend's amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly in support of the amendment. I note from the closing remarks of the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) that if the Minister is able to give us the reassurance that we seek, the matter will not be pressed.<br><br>
The removal of Crown immunity and the desirable effects of that should not be open to further dilution or dimunition by other powers that are being granted to health Ministers. As the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) made clear, that issue goes to the heart of the Bill. Both he and his honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that it relates to the central anxiety about the financial implications of the Bill.<br><br>
The modifications that Ministers are allowed to make to food legislation and to its application to health authorities, as "appears to be appropriate", will take place within this context:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 will have no implications for public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that such costs will have no effect on the expenditure of health authorities. If the Government assume that such costs will have no implications for public expenditure, that implies that more expenditure will be borne at local level. It seems that the Treasury is determined that it will not cost the Exchequer another penny.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
That will have a spiralling effect, as we have seen already in the Health Service under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Conservative Government. For example, the long overdue increase in pay for nurses is being achieved only at the expense of existing health authority budgets.<br><br>
Amendment No. 7 highlights the effects of the Bill and the powers that Ministers will take upon themselves. It casts into sharp relief the genuine anxiety felt by many about the implications for health authority budgets due to the lifting of Crown immunity.<br><br>
For example, the National Association of Health Authorities has made that point. Dr. Stephen Jenkins of the West Lambeth health authority said that it will cost £1.5 million to bring St. Thomas' kitchens in line with food regulations. That is a significant amount for only one hospital. If that amount is not only multiplied across the English and Welsh health authorities—I note the comments of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)—but is taken in the context of Scottish health boards, it will be considerable. It is not often that we say that we miss the Scottish Minister who is responsible for health matters, but we miss him on this occasion—perhaps not in the sense that that phrase is normally used.<br><br>
The Consumers Association says that subsection <i>2(b)</i> gives Ministers the power to diminish the impact of the legislation in any way that they see fit. It has already been said that it reintroduces Crown immunity by the back door.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can reassure me on two points. First, when we come to a later part of the Bill, we shall have a vigorous debate on whether these should be direct ministerial involvement at national level over an appeal system for those wishing to enter pharmacy contracting in the National Health Service. Ministers have set their faces against that by arguing that they do not wish to take upon themselves all the extra bureaucracy and inconvenience that that would involve. Clause 1 seems to turn that argument on its head because it will allow them to do something that they dismiss as being inappropriate with regard to another aspect of the Bill. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's justification for taking on far greater ministerial control in one part of the Bill, when the Government say that the last thing they want is for Ministers to take more decisions in connection with another part of the Bill. That seems fundamentally inconsistent.<br><br>
Secondly, subsection (1), on the
<br><blockquote><p>"Application of food legislation to health authorities and health service premises"</p></blockquote>
is followed by words which seem to render nugatory the entire impact of subsection (1). I hope that the Minister can reassure the Committee in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a constructive and positive debate on the amendment. I wish to underline what the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said about the widespread view on Second Reading of the desirability to make the advance as outlined in clause 1. I recognise the concern expressed by the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) about the general powers in subsection <i>(2)(b),</i> which could be used by Ministers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
to evade the spirit and intent of the clause as a whole and undermine and betray the consensus on Second Reading.<br><br>
The honourable Gentleman asked whether the Government would be able to reintroduce Crown immunity by the back door, as suggested by the Consumers Association. He also asked whether it would be possible to diminish the impact of the Bill by the use of those powers. It was proper to raise those questions. Indeed, I initially queried why the provision was necessary. I was advised by parliamentary counsel that the clause needs to be included as a prudent contingency provision to cover the possibility that the application of food legislation may not fit the way in which health authorities are constituted. Lawyers, from their vast experience of legislation, have seen that difficulties could arise over implementing a provision to remove Crown immunity from food legislation.<br><br>
I am advised that the amendment would not have a ratchet effect, as the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras suggests. I agree with the honourable Member for Ipswich that if it were felt that the provision was wholly inappropriate, it would be best to remove the clause from the Bill.<br><br>
I can give the assurances that the Committee seeks. The Government have no intention to use the provision to evade the spirit and intent of the Bill or to reintroduce Crown immunity by the back door. We could not use that power for a selective operation. It was suggested that we could discriminate and differentiate between the application of the provisions from one area to another. That does not apply. One could not do so. I am advised that the power to modify could be exercised only in relation to health authorities generally. It could not be used selectively.<br><br>
I have sought to give the strongest possible reassurance about the Government's intentions on the issue. It is clear that the power could be exercised only subject to the affirmative procedure of both Houses. The Government cannot exercise the power by the back door, as it were, not even by using the negative procedure. An affirmative resolution of both Houses would be required if the power were to be used. I can undertake now, if the Committee so wishes, to look at it again. I understand the worries that have been expressed and I want to do all that I can to make it absolutely clear that there is no resiling from what my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State announced following the Stanley Royd committee of inquiry's report and from what I said during the debates on the private Member's Bill introduced by my honourable Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). There is no intention to resile from the consensus that was established in the House on the matter. I am prepared to look again to see whether a way can be found of retaining the prudent contingency, so that it is clear that the power cannot be used in the way that has been suspected.<br><br>
As for whether the measure applies only to hospital kitchens and not to other parts of the hospital, I assure the Committee that the Bill applies to the premises—the hospital and the NHS premises
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0582">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
concerned. Therefore, the regulations would apply to health authorities and hospital premises to exactly the same extent as they would apply to everyone else. The regulations require those who handle food to protect that food from the risk of contamination, and they include requirements about personal cleanliness, the carriage and wrapping of food. Certainly, they are not limited to hospital kitchens. The regulations cover the handling of food at all stages.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras asked a fair question. I hope that my explanation will allow him to withdraw the amendment. I assure the Committee that I shall look again to see whether there is any way in which the wording of the provision can be altered to reinforce the undertakings that I have given in this short debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some trepidation about the clause because some employees in the Health Service in Scotland believe the legend that Crown immunity never has applied in any area of the Health Service in Scotland. In practice, there are no prosecutions in Scotland because they would be embarrassing for the Government. The Government forgot to include the Health Service bodies in Scotland when they introduced the initial legislation. That is how the legend runs. I hope that the Minister, with his profound knowledge of Scottish legislation, can assure me that that is no more than a legend.<br><br>
I am glad that the Minister said that he would look at the provision again. Having come across him in his previous incarnation as a Treasury Minister, I know that he is one of the more avuncular faces of Thatcherism. He is the kindly face of Thatcherism. He is liberal. He is pleasant. But we know that a reshuffle is coming. The right honourable Gentleman may not continue to be Minister for Health. A hard-line, nasty piece of work may be promoted from the Back Benches as Minister for Health. The new Minister might wish to cut every last penny that he can from the Health Service.<br><br>
Unless the clause is looked at again, it could be used by a less kindly Minister than the present Minister for Health for the purposes suggested by my honourable Friends. At least the Minister should have suggested, in view of the Acts covered in subsection 1(7)—the Food Act 1984, which covers England and Wales, and the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 and the Control of Food Premises (Scotland) Act 1977 and any regulations made under those last two Acts—as to where parliamentary counsel thinks there may be some loopholes by which health authorities will not be covered.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I have reservations about including anything that is not needed in legislation but is simply included as a catch-all provision in case Ministers have it wrong. With help from their advisers, Ministers should be able to give examples of what the catches might be. I accept that food legislation basically covers the preparation of food and the premises. I also accept that with modern technology—by using microwave
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
ovens, for example—food can be cooked quickly almost anywhere. One can argue that technology has changed and that the present food legislation does not cover that fact. If that is the argument, the Minister should cite examples.<br><br>
As a Scottish Member, I hope that the Minister will refer specifically to the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 and to the Control of Food Premises (Scotland) Act 1977. I suspect that the Minister's knowledge of the matter is profound and that he has read all the relevant legislation, as have his advisers.<br><br>
I am sure that the right honourable Gentleman can say exactly what parts of those two Acts there may be reservations about. Although the Opposition accept the Minister's assurance that he will look at the matter again, I hope that he will say a little more about which parts of existing food legislation in respect of England and Wales and of Scotland he believes might not be appropriate and, therefore, might have to be covered by regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might save time if I intervene now. I welcome the Minister's assurances, but I am ever mindful that the honourable Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) gave some assurances but later introduced regulations that did exactly the opposite. That is why I have a slightly jaundiced view of Ministerial assurances.<br><br>
I was mystified by the Minister's explanation. He said that the provision was a prudent contingency provision in case there were difficulties in applying food legislation that did not fit the way in which health authorities were constituted. I am not sure what that meant. At first sight, I had thought that provision might mean that some hospital kitchens and the way in which hospital food was organised was so different from the way in which food was handled in hotels or restaurants that technical problems might arise. But that has nothing to do with the way in which health authorities are constituted, which is a simple procedure. Health authorities are set up by statute. The authorities' members have certain duties and the staff have other duties.<br><br>
I fail to understand why modification should be made to food legislation because it might not fit in with the way in which health authorities are constituted. I should be grateful if the Minister would illustrate the problems which far-sighted parliamentary counsel may have seen just over the horizon. For example, is it feared that a personal duty might be involved and that the chairman of the health authority might be imprisoned because of persistent breaches of the legislation? I can think of one or two whom I would like imprisoned for consistently not providing a decent health service in my constituency. However, that is by the by.<br><br>
Does the danger exist for certain people to be subject to personal liability, prosecution, fine or imprisonment? When those people took on their jobs—such as general managers—on their new enhanced salaries, did they envisage their salaries disappearing into the court? Are health authorities constituted in such a way that they might pose those problems?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
It sounds to me as if those magic words "it might be administratively inconvenient" will be used about health authorities being covered by the food legislation. To some extent I am reassured by the Minister's reply, but the explanation about why the parliamentary counsel curled his peculiar and convoluted mind around the point and came up with this subsection, makes me more mystified than before.<br><br>
We are assured that it will require the affirmative procedure, which is welcome. But before we consider withdrawing the amendment we require an explanation of the weird and wonderful possibilities that might arise from the present way in which health authorities are constituted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims<span class='memberconstituency'> (Chislehurst)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable Friend has gone a very long way to meet the concern expressed by the Committee, not least in emphasising that should any regulations come forward to modify the proposals they would need the approval of the House. One can fully understand why the subsection was included to meet an unforeseen and, therefore, undefinable possibility. The Minister is wise to take into account the advice given to him by parliamentary counsel.<br><br>
However, I was surprised by the comment that any modification would affect all health authorities and could not simply affect one or two isolated authorities. In searching round for some of these possible unforeseen circumstances, one that occurs to me is that a large hospital is so built that there may be difficulties in fulfilling all of the law's requirements. Perhaps one particular establishment will merit, if only temporarily, exemption from this legislation and it might be convenient to give it geographical isolation and not a blanket exemption, which will cover all the others.<br><br>
If my right honourable Friend is looking at the matter again, perhaps he will consider whether it would be advantageous to include a measure to specify to which authority or institution the exemption will apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my honourable Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) for his general support and also for raising the question about individual premises in such a way.<br><br>
I am advised that the subsection gives no power to apply or disapply anything to particular authorities in special cases. In other words, it will only provide for changes that apply generally to all health authorities. Therefore, that question does not arise, but I shall certainly look at the matter again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will it apply to all health authorities in England and Wales—or in Scotland—but not necessarily to all health authorities in both cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My advice is that the power used under this section will have to apply generally when it is used. This power will be given by an affirmative resolution of the House. I believe I am right in saying that, but there may well be a separate provision for Scotland because the Acts are different. My basic point is that one cannot
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
differentiate between one hospital, or one little group of hospitals, in one part of the country and select it for special treatment.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that he could conceive of unforeseen circumstances that should be dealt with when they arise. By their very nature, if they are unforeseen we do not know what they will be. That is precisely the reason for including the subsection. I can give no examples, and it is merely prudent drafting by legal advisers and the parliamentary draftsmen that has made it possible to use precedents which are well established. Those precedents exist in the Food Act 1984, the Health Services Act 1980, the Data Protection Act 1984, the Medicines Act 1968 and no doubt in many other similar provisions. They are determined by the affirmative resolution procedure.<br><br>
I hope that having given very clear assurances, which indicate that the objective of this contingency provision will not in any way evade the spirit and intention that we established on Second Reading, but the reverse, and that it can be properly carried out, the Committee will believe that there is no need to press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not the Food Acts already have a built-in power to introduce regulations to amend them? Surely that is the appropriate point at which—having taken away Crown immunity for food legislation—any loophole for premises that cannot be covered under the Food Acts, for hospitals or any other body, should be covered under the Food Acts and not the regulations in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that that is so because subsection <i>(b)</i> says:
<br><blockquote><p>"make such modifications of the food legislation, in its application to health authorities".</p></blockquote>
In other words, that is a specific direction. We are dealing with a provision in the Bill before us, and the position might be different if we were discussing an amendment to the Food Act 1984, as the honourable Gentleman suggests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's undertaking, and in particular that he will look at the subsection again with a possibility of modification later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the honourable Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who tabled the amendment, cannot be here this morning.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to introduce a series of important issues such as securing proper hygiene standards, not just in the kitchens of hospitals but throughout their premises. That includes the car park from the outside gate, kitchens, preparation areas where food is assembled before delivery to patients, corridors where food is eaten and also its cycle after food has been eaten.<br><br>
The amendment will ensure that proper hygiene standards will be provided in lavatories, outside in the back yard, in the pig swill bins, when the refuse is collected and until it leaves the hospital. As my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said, people in hospitals are at most risk. So we must ensure that the highest standards of hygiene apply to those premises.<br><br>
Opposition Members are disappointed that the Government have put into the Bill merely the removal of Crown immunity with regard to food legislation in hospitals, and nothing else, especially hygiene legislation. I am advised that the provisions of the Public Health Act are outside the scope of the Bill, which was why one of our amendments could not be selected. However, this one is more general and we consider it to be more a probing amendment, on which the Committee could have a discussion. We could then perhaps discover the Government's intentions.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Why is it that the Government did not introduce legislation providing for proper hygiene standards throughout the premises? I shall refer to letters that I have received from the British Pest Control Association and <i>Which?</i> Although Committee members may have seen them already, it is important for their contents to be on the record. In that way, the Minister will have time to consider the matter and then give a proper response to our argument.<br><br>
The British Pest Control Association states:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is a very real danger that the NHS managements will be able to use the lifting of immunity to shift responsibility from themselves on to Environmental Health Departments, even though the latter will still not have the power needed to do their job properly."</p></blockquote>
That is the central issue. Environmental health officers will have some powers. No doubt the Minister will be the first to jump up if I am wrong, but I understand that they will be able to inspect food preparation, but not other things such as the state of the lavatories or whether the walls and corridors are clean. If they were able to undertake such inspections, however, there would not be enough of them to do so because they are understaffed, as are all local authorities at present.<br><br>
The provisions seem to be unclear on the role of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
environmental health officers. They might be able to pass the odd remark to the hospital management authorities, but they will not be able to insist that all the premises are kept in proper hygienic order.<br><br>
The association further states in its letter:
<br><blockquote><p>"In future EHO's will be able to require that cockroach infestations in kitchens are controlled but they will still not have effective powers where the infestations are elsewhere ie in the wards, day rooms, operating theatres, laboratories etc. In other words cockroaches in the kitchen will be illegal: cockroaches in patients beds, operating theatres and maternity wards will not."</p></blockquote>
That is a factor which we must consider. If cockroaches are in hospital kitchens, no one needs much imagination to know that they crawl from place to place, especially at night when the lights are out. They can easily reach all other parts of the hospital premises. It would be interesting to know whether there were a part of a hospital where cockroaches were not present. I should not be surprised if there were the occasional cockroach in operating theatres. Health authorities have to close down operating theatres occasionally because bugs get into them. I wonder what types of bugs are found and whether cockroaches are found occasionally not only in operating theatres but in the maternity wards and patients' beds that the association mentions.<br><br>
The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is because the Food Act 1984 and the food regulations are primarily concerned with food preparation areas. They do not allow EHO's the proper power to insist on adequate standards in those parts where food is not prepared or served."</p></blockquote>
That is the crunch of the issue. At exactly what point in the law can environmental health officers demand that something be done and, if it is not done, issue a law enforcement notice or start prosecution proceedings? Where is the line beyond which EHOs do not have that power and can only comment on unsightly or vermin-infested substances in, say, a corridor? I do not suggest that one sees such hospital corridors, but certainly one may see such refuse collection areas at the back of hospitals, which may be well away from the main food preparation areas.<br><br>
It is important that the Minister either gives an assurance that EHO's will or do have such a power—the British Pest Control Association does not believe that they do—or, if not, undertakes to introduce a suitable amendment on Report to set the position right. I am sure that the Committee would agree that this is no matter for dispute.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 may do the trick— but the Minister shakes his head. We do not have his expert parliamentary advice and facilities. Indeed, in many ways, it is a waste of time for Opposition Members to scratch their heads in an effort to frame amendments that are not technically defective. The Civil Service is the servant of the Government and it is up to the Minister, if he sees value in our proposal, to take it on board and to come back with an appropriate amendment.<br><br>
The British Pest Control Association makes further points which the Committee should hear. They are all centrally concerned with proper hygienic standards throughout the premises of a hospital, not merely where food is prepared. The association says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ordinarily the limited nature of the food legislation does not matter because EHO's have other powers they can use eg. section 35 of the 1961 Public Health Act."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
I am not sure whether section 35 still operates. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether it has been repealed. But it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority, upon consideration of a report from any of their officers, or other information in their possession, are satisfied that any premises—
<ol><li>are in such a filthy or unwholesome condition as to be prejudicial to health, or</li>
<li>are verminous,</li></ol>
the local authority shall give notice to the owner or occupier of the premises requiring him to take such steps as may be specified in the notice to remedy the condition of the premises by cleansing and disinfecting them, and the notice may require among other things the removal of wallpaper or other covering of the walls, or, in the case of verminous premises, the taking of such steps as may be necessary for destroying or removing vermin."</p></blockquote>
The association comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unfortunately this section is not covered by the new Bill and will not therefore apply to hospitals."</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, I hope that the Committee will agree that something should be done about it. Vermin prefer the kitchens and ducts of old hospitals, which have ducts and sewers leading directly down from the floor of the kitchens into the hospital system. I am glad to say that new hospital building avoids such a system, and the kitchens do not have holes in the floor. That is to be applauded. Perhaps all hospitals should be redesigned and re-equipped to lessen the vermin problems, but the fact remains that in our old hospitals and, indeed, some of the new ones, there are vermin, which like the kitchens. They can crawl about through the various systems to any other part of the hospital. It is possible and it happens, yet according to the BPCA the EHOs will not have the power to make sure that the other parts of the hospital are up to standard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the honourable Gentleman is aware of my difficulty on this. Clause 1 confines itself to food, and I ask him to confine his remarks to the food aspect of the kitchens rather than other parts of the hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek your advice, Sir Philip. The amendment has been selected and it proposes securing
<br><blockquote><p>"proper hygiene standards throughout all the premises."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, since food travels into almost every part of a hospital, hygiene standards throughout the premises must have a bearing on what happens to the food. It was in that spirit that I was speaking. However, I shall try to concentrate my remarks on food. On the other hand, because food travels through corridors and is eaten by patients in the wards and the refuse goes into the sewerage system either directly or via patients' lavatories, if hygiene standards are not maintained there, patients may fall ill and be more at risk than they would otherwise be. Perhaps there is a fine line, and I shall try to keep to the right side of it.<br><br>
The British Pest Control Association goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Standards in 'food rooms', ie any room (being, or being part of, any food premises), in which any person engages in the handling of food for the purposes of a food business, need to be very high."—</p></blockquote>
I think that we all agree on that—
<br><blockquote><p>"Regulation 25 of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1970 States:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'The walls, floors, doors, windows, ceiling, woodwork and all other parts of the structure of every food room shall be kept clean and shall be kept in such good order, repair and condition as to—

<ol><li>enable them to be effectively cleaned; and</li>
<li>prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, any risk of infestation by rats, mice or insects.' "</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Again, I hope that that applies in the Bill. If it is part of what the Government call the food regulation, I shall be very pleased.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene to ask your advice, Sir Philip, regarding the scope of amendment No. 9, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"to secure proper hygiene standards throughout all the premises".</p></blockquote>
The amendments have been selected and they contain the words "the premises", so presumably we are discussing the framework of the premises of, let us say, a hospital complex. I appreciate the scope of the Bill, and I ask your advice because I want to keep my own remarks within the bounds of order when I speak again. Am I to understand that clause 1 relates to kitchens or any areas where food is served or prepared, and would that extend to, for example, a kitchen in a nurses' hostel where food is prepared?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman drew attention to the generosity of the selection of amendments as some are very marginal. However, that was on the assumption that "premises" referred to places where food was prepared. The honourable Gentleman's last point is a matter for debate, and not for the Chair.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am thinking on my feet, but clause 1(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the food legislation—…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p><i>(b)</i> premises used by a health authority shall not be regarded as property of or property held on behalf of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to challenge your ruling about the selection, Sir Philip, but I understand that all the premises used by the National Health Service
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be regarded as property of or property held on behalf of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
If food is prepared, eaten, transferred or stored in any part of the property, there must be proper hygiene.<br><br>
I thank my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich for his remarks as they help to clarify the issue. It is important to note that we are worried not only about kitchens as food may be carried from one part of the premises to another.<br><br>
The British Pest Control Association cites regulation 25 of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1970, which refers to food rooms being kept clean and states that the risk of infestation by rats, mice and insects should be prevented. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"However for some peculiar reason day rooms in hospitals and homes for the aged and handicapped are excluded. So too are wards and ward kitchens. This means that even when hospitals do not have Crown immunity under the food legislation, they will have special exclusions which will make enforcement far more difficult."</p></blockquote>
That comment is not made capriciously or without thought. That eminent association considered such matters carefully. It shows anxiety that the Bill may not do what we seek. Kitchens in hospitals should be safe and the food through the whole chain should be as good and wholesome as possible, so that extra infections will be minimised and patients will have the best chance of recovery.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
It appears that there may be a serious flaw in the Bill and that EHOs will be unable to exercise proper control. The association continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pest control is of course as important a part of hygiene as is cleanliness or temperature control and cockroach stories have been the major feature of press reports we have seen during the past 12 months."</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee with stories in the press about cockroaches. I have a pile of cuttings in my room—we would not believe the stories if they had not been substantiated and printed in the newspapers. It is a serious matter, which the Bill should seek to put right.<br><br>
The association continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The food legislation rightly recognises this and refers to the presence of rats, mice and insects as being unacceptable. Yet many pests found in food stores are not insects at all but mites, eg flour mite. In addition pest problems are also caused by birds and feral cats, neither of which are included in the definitions."</p></blockquote>
Again, there appears to be a hole in the legislation. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments. I cite an editorial in <i>Which?</i> in February 1986, which refers to sparrows flying round the restaurant in Charing Cross hospital. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Over the last couple of years, there have been some major scandals involving hospital food. These include: Nineteen people died at Stanley Royd Hospital, Wakefield, following an outbreak of salmonella poisoning there. Another 400 or so were affected. Cockroaches were found in food at the Royal Free Hospital, London."</p></blockquote>
The food legislation covers that. But the editorial continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"At Charing Cross Hospital, London, an environmental health officer found that sparrows had been flying round the restaurant, a cupboard in the bakery was infested by black ants, mouse droppings littered a disused oven, and a thrush had excreted into trays of jellies."</p></blockquote>
The food legislation does not name specifically, so presumably does not cover, other animals and creatures, such as mites, birds and feral cats.<br><br>
I have no objection to birds and cats. In their place, they are much loved by people. We are not trying to proscribe them or control their numbers, but they must be in their place, which is not in hospital kitchens or where food is being prepared, transported or stored. That can lead to the risk of greater infection and patients having less chance of being well and healthy at the end of their stay in hospital.<br><br>
I shall summarise briefly. The amendment is important although it may be defective, and we accept responsibility for that. There are serious omissions in the Bill and current legislation, so I hope that we have persuaded the Minister that they should be tightened up to make it absolutely clear that environmental health officers not only possess the power but can exercise it. Often, powers are available but because of difficulties, such as understaffing, it is impossible for them to be executed properly, so they are underused. We must consider both sides of the argument.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will either accept our amendment or table his own on Report to ensure not only that food legislation applies to hospital premises but that the premises operate in the best hygienic environment. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak in support of amendment No. 9, which would add the words
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"to secure proper hygiene standards throughout all the premises".</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether there is a definition of the word "premises" in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister gave a generous answer to our first amendment and promised to consider our arguments. You, Sir Philip, said that you were generous in your interpretation of the amendments when selecting them. Everyone is feeling generous. I am slightly suspicious of such an abundance of generosity. It is quite different from arguing with the Treasury. I will obey the punter's first instinct: when one's luck is in, bet heavily. Therefore I shall ask the Minister more questions about the application of the principle behind clause 1.<br><br>
The Minister, in his approach to the Bill, has been observing the first principle of political reform and attack. He is legislating where the shoe pinches. Most complaints about Crown immunity relate to hospital kitchens, the serving of food, its temperature and so on. That is where the problem lies and on which the Minister is legislating. That is a sound principle and is the basis of much of our legislation. He has highlighted his priority of dealing with some of those problems that have caused public discontent and has made some headway by introducing the clause.<br><br>
So far, so good! However, my honourable Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) rightly reminded us that it is not as simple as that. The Minister is legislating on a principle that lies behind the hygienic serving of food on premises. The question that immediately springs to my mind is whether the proper serving of food within the regulations is confined to kitchens. Is it a kitchen principle? Does the legislation go further and cover a kitchen in a nurses' hostel?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Cook <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend intend to develop that argument further? Will he ask about hospital wards in prisons?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not push my luck that far, even though I am tempted to do so. Perhaps my honourable Friend may wish to take some risks on his own behalf. If so, I wish him the best of luck. I will be interested to see how he gets on.<br><br>
If the word "premises" in that context is used within the framework of buildings, I am through the gap because it could include hostel accommodation where the same sort of problems about hygiene might arise, as they do on hospital premises.<br><br>
Nurses' accommodation has been the subject of a Rayner inquiry which investigated the principles on which such accommodation operated and whether it was needed. If such accommodation is privatised, an appeal about the hygiene of those kitchens can be made in common law.<br><br>
Will Crown immunity stretch to such premises? If not, will the Minister strongly consider stretching the principle to where food is served in nurses' hostels? The same principle applies, except that it will be applied specifically to the people who perform the services in hospitals, namely, the nurses.<br><br>
If the Minister on reflection believes that the Bill is not clear in that respect, will he clarify and amend it to include hostel accommodation, perhaps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
thinking sympathetically about what I have said? In that respect, I may be saving the Minister a great deal of legal quibbling later. Perhaps he could get the best advice from his parliamentary draftsmen as they usually stay very much on the side of caution. I appeal to the Minister, as the repository of wisdom in these matters, and perhaps he could advise the Committee whether there is any substance in my argument.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should first deal with the more substantial element of the amendments referred to by the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). While staying within the rules of order, I think that the honourable Gentleman was making the speech that he would have been much more delighted to make had amendments Nos. 2 and 5 been selected. Those amendments sought to apply section 35 of the Public Health Act 1961 more widely. Indeed, amendments Nos. 8 and 10 are dependent upon amendments Nos. 2 and 5.<br><br>
As amendments Nos. 2 and 5 were not selected. Amendments Nos. 8 and 10 are very narrow, and I am advised that references to section 35 of the Public Health Act 1961 are not appropriate to achieve what I believe the honourable Gentleman and his honourable Friends had in mind.<br><br>
The appropriate reference is section 83 of the Public Health Act 1936. However, as neither of the main amendments were chosen, it is an academic point. The Bill deals only with food legislation and with the lifting of Crown immunity from the premises of health authorities. As I explained earlier, that goes much wider than kitchens. Amendment No. 10 and the relevant section of amendment No. 8 seek to take that further, but they would not have any effect on the Bill except to introduce some rather superfluous wording.<br><br>
I remind the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), who spoke to amendment No. 9, that we are dealing not only with kitchens, but with premises that are used by health authorities. Under the Bill, we are lifting Crown immunity in respect of food regulations. The amendment seeks to add a little bit to subsection (2) <i>(b),</i> to which I referred. I gave clear assurances to the Committee that I shall consider the matter further to try and ensure—if extra assurance is needed—that the subsection cannot be used to resile from the intention shared by all Committee members. I shall take into account what has been said about the addition, although I do not think that it would apply, considering the context of subsection (2) <i>(b).</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the other amendments have not been selected and it could be argued that without them, this amendment does not stand on its own. Nevertheless, there is a problem in hospitals of hygiene and birds, feral cats and so on. We hope that we shall be able to table new clauses later that would bring the parts of the public health legislation pertaining to food within the provisions of the Bill. In anticipation of that, will the Minister tell us whether he considers that our arguments are valid in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
terms of making hospitals healthier and more wholesome places?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Filthy and verminous conditions in hospitals are unacceptable. I hope that there is no difference of opinion among Committee members about that. Equally, let us not denigrate the majority of people working in the Health Service who do everything that they can to maintain high standards of hygiene. We accept that there are instances of when high standards are departed from and mistakes arise. But no message should go out from the Committee that we are complacent about the problem.<br><br>
In preparing the new guidance following the report of the Stanley Royd committee of inquiry, we shall be considering whether any extra guidance needs to be given to health authorities about hygiene. But I reiterate that the Bill deals with the lifting of Crown immunity from food legislation. The wider questions about applying the provisions of the Public Health Acts to the Bill are beyond its scope. I am sure that I would be running into difficulties with you, Sir Philip, if I sought to accept the argument seductively posed by the honourable Member for Wrexham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems rather strange since most of the groups representing those involved in public health believe that the food legislation for hospitals needs to be amended to cover rats, mice, insects, mites, birds and feral cats. The legislation will be unsatisfactory unless it does. I am always the first to accept that there may be things which are desperately wrong with my amendments. They may be inaccurate, out of order, nothing to do with the Bill under discussion or should have been drafted as new clauses. I suppose that other aspects of them may be unsatisfactory, too. But we believe that our proposals are material. Such unhygienic circumstances are known to have prevailed, for instance, in the kitchens in the basement of St. Thomas' hospital. I can see the hospital through the window of this Room.<br><br>
We are advised by those who wish to improve matters at St. Thomas' hospital and elsewhere that it would strengthen the hand of those who want to improve the kitchens and altogether strengthen the hygiene standards of the hospitals if the reference to:
<br><blockquote><p>"rats, mice, insects, mites, birds and feral cats"</p></blockquote>
were incorporated in the legislation.<br><br>
The Minister believes that certain of our proposals about lifting all Crown immunity from NHS premises is outside the scope of the Bill as drafted. We accept that that is the Minister's view although we do not accept it as a fact. Since the Government rightly changed their mind and agreed to lift Crown immunity, we understand that they intend to lift Crown immunity from kitchens and to improve food hygiene. Therefore, we seek an undertaking from the Minister that by an amendment or new clause in Committee or on Report, he will make the change that we propose, or one on the same lines, that will so extend the food legislation as to cover those categories of vermin and thus improve food hygiene in hospitals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0588">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
We believe that that is wholly within the purpose of the Bill as drafted—as described and as trumpeted out in DHSS press statements and even as mentioned on television—and wholly within the purview of what the Government have talked about. Will the Minister say that he will undertake to do that by whatever means seem appropriate? We believe that it would be a prudent contingency provision—something dear to the Minister's heart— if a change in the Bill were made on those lines. Will he agree to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall look at the matter again. But what has now been said by the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) is not in the amendment, which deals with the Public Health Acts. His new proposal has different scope. I must respond to the amendments that are tabled. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not get fussed about that fact. If, however, the honourable Gentleman is arguing that there might be something wrong with the food regulations and legislation in terms of lifting Crown immunity for hospital premises, I shall look at it again, without commitment of course. I shall consider the points made by the honourable Gentleman.<br><br>
My immediate reaction is to say that I hope that if a need for change along the lines suggested by the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras were found, probably it would be appropriate for such change to apply generally, not to be confined to the premises owned by health authorities. If some deficiency in the food regulations is now being identified, it should apply generally, not be limited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it clear that I hold no brief even for amendments that I drafted. Perhaps I hold a greater brief for those drafted by the honourable Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd). Even as drafted, both amendments refer to vermin:
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of … or the food legislation".</p></blockquote>
Both our amendment and the amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Aldridge-Brownhills refer specifically to food legislation as well as to changes in the Public Health Act 1961. Therefore, we believe that the Minister's advisors should have briefed the Minister as to whether the change would be appropriate. We are advised by environmental health officers and those working within the NHS that they would welcome the change without having to wait for an overall change in food legislation.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
We see nothing wrong in having stronger food legislation for hospitals than for other premises, because hospital occupants are peculiarly vulnerable. That is why amendment No. 7 proposes extending food legislation for hospitals, and we think that appropriate. Hospital circumstances are different and tend not to apply to most of the premises for which the general food legislation was intended.<br><br>
Not many cafes and restaurants have the Victorian layout perculiar to St Thomas' hospital basement, which must have 150 doors. It looks as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
though it is intended to be a place for feral cats to live—like a feral cattery. The same applies to many of our old hospitals where the buildings are separate from each other, which are far more likely to attract birds, rats, mice and such like than would a large hotel. They have separate buildings, separate premises and scrubby old basements—nearly every old hospital that I have ever been in seems to have an immensely scrubby old basement, even famous and prestigious old hospitals. Those who have put so much effort into getting Crown immunity lifted in the first place have identified this as an omission, and we think that it ought to be put right.<br><br>
I do not want to get ratty with the Minister—it is not in my nature—but I hope that he will accept, or have his officials consider, the possibility of changing the law on food legislation as it applies to hospitals to define vermin as including
<br><blockquote><p>"rats, mice, insects, mites, birds and feral cats".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, if his esteemed official or the Parliamentary Counsel—the haven of prudent contingency provision—should come up with any other animal that should be defined as vermin, we would be happy later—in Committee, on Report or even in House of Lords amendments—to accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some brief comments to make on clause stand part. It provides an opportunity further to consider one or two general issues arising from the substance of the clause. These were prompted by the Minister's Second Reading speech, which was full of information, when he came out strongly on certain matters. Perhaps I can ask him a series of questions.<br><br>
Several matters still cause me concern. First, the Minister rightly said that the ability, through the changed legal relationship brought about by the clause, to bring prosecutions when food regulations have been violated will take us some but not all of the way; it is merely a contribution to the solution. Indeed, in his statement to the House, the Secretary of State said that the clause and related matters would provide "stronger safeguards … to underpin management effort". <br><blockquote><p>—<i>{Official Report,</i> 6 February 1986; Vol. 91, <i>c.211.]</i></p></blockquote>
In other words, the clause will strengthen the whole structure at the joints—at least, it is hoped that it will.<br><br>
Does the Minister think that the management effort so far in response to the problems has been good or bad, adequate or inadequate? Is it patchy? Does it vary? What plans does the Minister have to ensure that we have the best practice throughout the country?<br><br>
The Minister has said that the important factor is the relationship that develops between management and environmental health officers. I take that point on board. A working relationship—day in, day out—in which matters are improved slowly over long periods, is of critical importance. But do bad results in the lurid form that we have seen meant that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
relations between management and the inspectorate have broken down? If so, where have they broken down and how should they be strengthened?<br><br>
In Charing Cross hospital, infestations of mice, rice coated with bacteria and colonies of ants and cockroaches were reported. That is vivid enough, but the disturbing aspect is the fact that the environmental health officers had been reporting those conditions as far back as 1978. What was happening in the meantime? What sort of relationship had developed and where on earth was it leading?<br><br>
Given the fact that the conditions were common knowledge and that they were being reported all the time, what sort of relationship allowed the problem to continue in such an acute fashion? What, in the Minister's analysis, went wrong with the relationship and why did it lead in a direction which, in constructive terms, was nowhere? No one appeared to be getting anywhere until the problem reached crisis proportions.<br><br>
In the light of the information available to the Minister, will he say whether the management in many areas is good enough? What does he think about it? Moreover, my honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) gave a vivid description of the Victorian conditions in many kitchens. Is it possible for management to make arrangements in line with the strictness of some of the regulations, given the physical conditions in which they operate?<br><br>
We have not had a debate on resources because, quite rightly, the subject is outside the scope of the Bill but, with all the regulations in the world, if the physical background makes it impossible to apply them they are not worth very much because they do not reach the first fence.<br><br>
The report on Stanley Royd hospital advised that there was not enough evidence to bring a case. That rather shook me. What sort of evidence does one need to bring a case after 19 people died and many others were affected? What is the value of regulations if one needs a burden of proof of that magnitude? It fills me with foreboding. Will the Minister tell us what the obstacle was in that case?<br><br>
I have not asked those questions in a spirit of carping criticism, because I welcome the clause. It is a significant step forward, and although the Minister has attacked the problem where the shoe pinches—a respectable political approach—I hope that it is his hope and determination to extend the principle to other National Health Service premises. In the light of his past experience, how does the Minister see what he is attempting to do here?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the same spirit as the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), I welcome the clause but—as in our first debate—we need greater reassurance from the Minister. Despite anything that he may say this morning, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating—although I am not sure how appropriate that phrase is. Given the practical effects that this will have when it is implemented, I should like to ask the Minister about the implications and about further decisions, which, I suspect, would require no legislation or affirmative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
orders but would simply require willingness on the part of Ministers of Health.<br><br>
The first question relates to the general argument running through the Government's case—that the measure will not have significant financial implications. Will the Minister undertake that when the Bill becomes law, and health authorities—and health boards in Scotland—look at the financial implications for their areas, he will call for an analysis from them of the effects at local level? At this stage—because obviously we too do not yet know what the implications will be—we simply want him to say that he will look at them with an open mind.<br><br>
I have already quoted a figure of £1.5 million, which is the amount thought to be necessary to bring the kitchens at St Thomas' across the river in line with food regulations. The Minister has said that next year, additional resources of £650 million will be allocated to the health authorities to be spent as they think best. One can argue—as we have done— about the extent to which that represents an increase in real terms.<br><br>
In the context of the clause there are related issues of funding that cannot be overlooked. For example, the British Pest Control Association says that hospital management ignorance of pest control techniques is significant. It recommends that a certain amount of the £650 million that the Minister is making available should be earmarked for hygiene. I should be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to that.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State said on Second Reading that a general repeal of Crown immunity was not necessary because the Crown notice system worked well enough. He said that although 300 notices had been issued since 1970, not once was if found necessary to take action.<br><br>
I concur with the remarks made about Stanley Royd hospital because even that horrific case would not have provided sufficient grounds for further legal action. That seems extraordinary. Given the Under-Secretary's summing up speech on Second Reading, to what extent is the Minister and his Department satisfied that the Bill will redress that considerable anomaly, which surely must be unacceptable.<br><br>
The existing Crown notice system results in delays because there is no automatic offence for failing to meet deadlines. The Health and Safety Executive inspectors, who will have a major role to play in connection with this legislation, will be operating with a reduction of 20 per cent, in their numbers. They will have to spend time returning to Crown premises to persuade employees to comply with the notices. Deadlines can be renegotiated in connection with premises that do not come under the Crown immunity provisions, but as the Department has said, such instances are comparatively rare.<br><br>
The honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) says that the case at Stanley Royd hospital would not have led to a prosecution. That is also reflected north of the border. Last year, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
procurator fiscal tried to prosecute a health board for a serious offence under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. The case was initiated to clarify the confused definition of Crown premises. However, the case was withdrawn after legal advice. It seems that north of the border also has similar problems that may not be fully redressed by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the legal advisers said that it would be embarrassing to people south of the border if the case were proceeded with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Scots being generous, if not gregarious, would never wish to embarrass those on the poorer side of the border.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State made his original statement on 6 February of his intention to introduce the Bill, he said that making hospital catering subject to the Food Act would be coupled with strengthened guidance to the Health Service on measures to ensure high hygiene standards. What is being done about that? We can pass almost anything we like in the House, but if it is not fed down through the system and is not acted upon by the Scottish Home and Health Department and by those who carry through such measures from the Elephant and Castle, the Bill will be meaningless. What has been done to follow through the intention announced by the Secretary of State in the House on 6 February?<br><br>
I return again to the comments from the British Pest Control Association. It says that it is
<br><blockquote><p>"unacceptable to have only 1 in 7 canteen officials who have attended the DHSS course in pest control awareness, and that Environmental Health Officers should be encouraged to send people on these courses without pressure of financial constraint."</p></blockquote>
They currently operate under such restraints.<br><br>
In welcoming the clause, I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that there are a number of other related matters which will be necessary to give it full effect. Therefore, as the legislation comes forward to fruition we hope that the Government will follow that course.<br><br>
Further, I hope that the Minister will give a specific open-minded commitment to listen to what the health authorities and the health boards in Scotland have to say when they total up what the legislation will mean to them. It may mean specific earmarking of, or additional, funding and if the explanatory and financial memorandum is incorrect I hope that the Government will be generous enough to act accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two most remarkable statements concerning the clause are not in the Bill but in the explanatory and financial memorandum. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 has no implications for public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill has no manpower implications."</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand how the Government can make such statements.<br><br>
If all premises used by a health authority are now to be covered by food legislation, such as hospitals, health clinics, health centres—I know some of my English colleagues may say that health clinics and centres are not covered, but in Scotland they are owned by the health authority—office premises—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend raises an important point. I hope the Minister will take into consideration health centres in England and Wales, where the position is slightly different. It will help the Committee if the Minister will reply to our questions on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is aware that in Scotland there is a unitary Health Service. Therefore, the health boards cover the family practitioner services as well as hospitals and other services. That is not the case in England and Wales and the legislation does not make that clear.<br><br>
If those bodies, including nurses homes and other premises relating to the health authorities, come under the Food Acts—I believe that the honourable Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) was wrong—it will mean that the environmental health officers for each local authority in which these premises are located would be empowered to visit and inspect those premises. Presumably, they will be empowered to do that and not simply to do so if they wish. When the Bill is enacted the environmental health officers should inspect such premises.<br><br>
When those officers visit a hospital that was built in the late 19th century—we have several such hospitals in Glasgow—such as St. Thomas' over the river, they may inspect the kitchens and say, "Ah, sorry but that cooker is too close to that fridge; your walls need liming; you must have a wall to divide this part of the kitchen from that part because the food preparation is different and there must be a division." I am sure that many minor regulations under the Food Act 1984 are not always obeyed by everyone although one would hope that they would be obeyed in hospitals.<br><br>
People are told that they must do this and that before the environmental health officers will say that their kitchens comply with the Food Act 1984. Moreover, the Act gives the officers the power to say that unless something is done in the next three weeks or three or 12 months—whatever the period they care to choose—the kitchen must be closed. The officers are entitled to do that for a hotel. They can say, "Sorry, but cockroaches were running around the kitchen floor. That has happened because you are not separating your flour store from the food preparation area, so mice are being attracted into that area. Therefore, we are closing you down." That happens. Usually, it happens to a transport cafe rather than to such places as the Dorchester hotel, although cockroaches are more likely to be running around the floor in the Dorchester's kitchens than in a transport cafe. But all such establishments can be closed down. So, presumably, in future, a hospital can be told to close down its kitchens.<br><br>
Health authorities cannot ignore that fact. They cannot have their kitchens closed when so many patients in their wards require food. Moreover, the nurses, doctors and other hospital staff require food. It is not viable for the health authorities to ignore the fact. They must put matters right, which has financial implications. Who will provide the money?<br><br>
In my constituency, the Greater Glasgow health

board has a deficit of £3 million on its budget last year. But the Government have made no allowance for the £3 million overspend when considering the board's proposed budget for this year. Even if the board makes the required savings in terms of this year's budget, it probably will overspend by £6 million. By next year, the figure could be £9 million.<br><br>
Where will the board find the money to put right kitchens that might be found to be unsatisfactory by the environmental officers of the local authority? Will the board simply add to its debt? If the board puts one kitchen right, will it have to close down a health centre elsewhere because it has insufficient money to run it? Or will the board be given the money by the Government under the Bill?<br><br>
The Bill has financial implications. It is nonsense for the Government to suggest that such legislation has no financial implications. There must be. Indeed, a burden will be placed on health authorities, some of which, simply because of—I shall be moderate and use the word "constraints" rather than "cuts"—financial constraints, cannot afford to meet the obligations put upon them by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourble Gentleman further agree that another curious point is often overlooked by the Government? If the legislation has no financial implications, the Government suggest that there is no problem to correct. But if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
there were no problem, the legislation would not be needed in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maxton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The Government imply that everything in the garden is rosy. They imply that each kitchen and all health authority premises are alright now. As the honourable Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said, if everything in the garden were rosy, there should be no need to introduce legislation. Moreover, the Government are not wont to introduce legislation that they consider unnecessary. There is a financial implication.<br><br>
The Government also claim that there is no manpower implication.</span></p>
