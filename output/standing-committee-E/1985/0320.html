	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 322, in clause 133, page 101, line 23, leave out

	<p>No. 350, in clause 140, page 105, line 2, leave out "an advertisement" and insert "a prospectus".</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For all those reasons, I hope that my hon. Friends will feel able to withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Oonagh McDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After that very succinct ending to the Mnister's speech, I should like to ask him one or two questions, especially in respect of his comments about the Eurobond market. In our previous sitting, he said:
	<br><q><p>"far from restricting the Eurobond market we are removing a restraint from it, and domestic companies will be able to tap it freely." 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 18 March 1986; c.856.]</p></q>
He went on to say that the legislation was not intended to cover the Eurobond markets. I should like him to justify that a little further. The Eurobond market has developed very rapidly and is very free from restraint.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
Does the Minister think that it is adequate to leave it like that? What sort of existing restrictions does he think are significant? I should like him to develop that part of his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The characteristic of the Eurobond markets, as they are presently conducted, is that, essentially, they concern dealings between what are often called professional investors. I use the word "professional" with some diffidence because the term is not susceptible to easy definition. These are not markets in which the untutored domestic investor normally plays a significant part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, and especially bearing in mind the fact that much of the business done on the Eurobond markets has no natural connection with London, and presently takes place here simply because the facilities on offer are more competitive and efficient than elsewhere, we think it appropriate to make specific provision for them, as I suggested in our previous sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister expressed diffidence about the definition of "professional" in respect of this issue. The distinction between "professional" and "nonprofessional" investors is important, and it is worrying because, as he suggested, it is ill-defined. Does it concern him that he cannot give a more precise definition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the reasons why I said at our previous sitting that we are prepared to look at the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statement of my hon. and learned Friend the Minister at the end of our previous sitting was rather detailed and complex, although I am grateful to his officials for making available the notes. I am intrigued by the fact that one paragraph does not appear to have been delivered. Perhaps I should read it to the Committee, as it is a good paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will appreciate that my hon. and learned Friend is updating the provisions of a law which is now nearly 150 years old, and to provide for it to be kept internally consistent. I understand that he is hoping to integrate it into the new framework of securities law. Some of the concepts are novel, at least for this country, but they have been tried in other jurisdictions and found to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the availability of the notes, we have not been able to take on board all the implications, so I shall confine myself to welcoming what my hon. and learned Friend says about the intended effect of part V. I am sure that his remarks will be interesting and reassuring to those involved in the capital markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially pleased to hear my hon. and learned Friend's undertaking to introduce amendments and I welcome his assurances on consultation, especially on the statutory instruments that will be made under part V. I hope that drafts of the statutory instruments will be available soon, especially in view of the doubts about whether the Secretary of State's rule-making powers provide sufficient flexibility, but in the light of my hon. and learned Friend's assurance at the end of our previous sitting I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<i>Clause 132 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 133 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 134</div> <!-- clause -->
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>FORM AND CONTENT OF PROSPECTUS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 102, line 17, after "with", insert
	<br><q><p>"any rules or requirements of any recognised investment exchange or with".</p></q>
The amendment would allow compliance with the requirements of any recognised investment exchange to be regarded as compliance with the Secretary of State's rules. For example, the amendment would enable compliance with the requirements of the stock exchange on prospectuses for unlisted securities market companies to be regarded as sufficient if the Secretary of State so wished. The provision could be extended to cover any recognised investment exchange for example, a market on which Eurobonds were traded—thus providing greater flexibility in the more sophisticated markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much to commend the idea behind the amendment. It is not, in fact, a novelty that the listing requirements of a recognised exchange should have equal validitiy with statutory prospectus requirements. Until the listing legislation came into force on 1 January 1985, the stock exchange had the power under section 39 of the Companies Act 1948 to grant certificates of exemption from the statutory prospectus requirements. Nobody questions the fact that the stock exchange's requirements, whether for the main market or the USM, are considerably higher than those laid down in the Companies Act 1985, which have changed little in half a century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an important distinction between the listing requirements of an exchange and prospectus law. Admission to a market involves more than the publication of a document. It is the first step into a system of continuous disclosure, while the publication of a prospectus and the offering of securities outside a market is an isolated event, albeit an important one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be best to undertake further consultations before deciding how best to give effect to idea underlying the amendment. My hon. Friend's approach has the great merit of simplicity, but prudence suggests a closer look before concluding that it is sufficient. I ask him not to press the amendment to a Division, on the assurance that I shall reflect and consult further and, if appropriate, table an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for his assurance and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause says:
	<br><q><p>"A prospectus shall contain such information and comply with such other requirements as may be prescribed by rules made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this section."</p></q>
The problem is that we are discussing a skeleton Bill. The flesh is not there for us to pick over properly. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
rules have not yet been published so we cannot examine and discuss them in detail. First, will the Minister assure us that the rules will be available for thorough examination before Report so that we can see whether they are adequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wish to voice some anxieties. The over-the-counter market is, as the Minister knows, a high-risk market which is especially vulnerable to scandal and there have been scandals in that market already. It is a market in which little trading takes place after the first lot of shares has been sold and there have been some spectacular losses. Nevertheless, the Government want to encourage the market, because it allows companies to go public at the beginning of their operations and, it is hoped, build themselves up. Therefore, it is important that it should be properly regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a few questions to alert his attention to some points, although he may not be able to answer until later. Does he agree that the disclosure requirements for listed securities should differ from those for unlisted securities? How should information to investors about unlisted securities be updated after prospectus has been issued?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent Department of Trade and Industry document seems to allow for the possibility of mini-prospectuses. Will they be allowed in the Bill? Will the requirements be tougher than those of the Companies Act 1985? Those questions must be asked about the prospectus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not sure yet who will oversee the over-the-counter market. NASDIM has been recognised and it expects to oversee it, but the British Institute of Dealers in Securities is pushing hard for that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Library research note nicely quotes the "Panorama" programme of 4 November 1985 in which Mr. Wilmot, the chairman of Harvard Securities, one of the leading companies in BIDS, was questioned. When he was asked whether his company could manipulate prices, he replied:
	<br><q><p>"I'm astounded by the question. We don't manipulate. We never have manipulated and we don't fix prices.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>INTERVIEWER: 'Who investigates then any case of malpractice in your judgment at Harvard?'</p></q>
	<br><q><p>WILMOT: 'I do.'</p></q>
	<br><q><p>INTERVIEWER: 'So effectively you're potential poacher and gamekeeper?'</p></q>
	<br><q><p>WILMOT: 'That's true enough, yes.' "</p></q>
That illustrates that it is a difficult market, which needs stringent regulation if it is to serve the function that I think the Government want it to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with the possibility of regulation, rather than the full details, and we should like to see more of the details before we finish with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to find an appropriate clause under which to raise general issues of that sort. I know that they are a trifle wide of the clause, but it seemed an appropriate one under which to air them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) has said. We are discussing the really critical area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Eurobond market is, on the whole, capable of looking after itself, but Harvard Securities, and Mr. Wilmot are the sort of organisation and person that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
the Bill is all about. If Mr. Wilmot is not in the business of manipulating prices as he said on "Panorama", I do not know why he bothers to go into the office each day. That is what his company is all about. The British Institute of Dealers in Securities is a front organisation for his company. There is no question of BIDS being recognised, as it has only four members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proper, recognised investment exchange is needed for dealings in the over-the-counter market. It may be appropriate for NASDIM to organise it or it may be for someone else to do, but the Securities and Investments Board should devote a large proportion of its resources to ensuring that the area is properly regulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the requirements of prospectuses and not with the general question of the regulation of the over-the-counter or any other market. The regulation of transactions in those markets will be supervised by a self-regulating organisation within the general framework of regulation provided by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the rule-making power relating to the form and content of prospectuses. The rules cover such matters as the type used, legibility, and the length of time information is to be displayed in an advertisement. They will replace those presently in schedule 3 to the Companies Act 1985, which set out the required contents of prospectuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) asked three questions. There will be different rules for listed and unlisted securities. However, for the public companies that the hon. Lady referred to, the differences are likely to be small and the requirements contained in the rules more rigorous and demanding than those in the Companies Act. Mini-prospectuses will be allowed, but they may be published only by authorised businesses and if the full prospectus is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot assure the hon. Lady that the rules will be available before Report stage, although we shall consult widely before making rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's final point related to updating. Continuous disclosure is important in this area, and there will be requirements for continuous disclosure under the rules provided for in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his last point. I regret that the rules will not be available in time. We should not deal just with the general framework of regulation when the details will be extremely important as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to widen the issues under the clause because I see no other suitable way of dealing with the anxieties shared by both sides of the Committee on the operations of the OTC market. It is a significant market for small investors. Such companies, offering a small number of shares at low prices, tend to run away with working-class people's redundancy money. If the Government want to encourage the small investor, for heaven's sake let us protect people who do not know their way round the business world. Will the Minister let us know—perhaps on Report—what he intends to do about that market and which SRO will be ultimately responsible for it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
Finally, the differences between listed and unlisted securities relate to a minimum public ownership—in the USA it is as low as 10 per cent—and the trading record period need be only three years. Will there be any move towards either increasing the minimum public ownership, or lengthening the trading record period? I am aware that that point goes rather wide of clause 134, but we have to debate the matter at some time, and now seems as good a time as any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the discussion will not last too long, because it is indeed going wide of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no direct opportunity for discussing such matters under this part of the Bill because they are not regulated here. The conduct of transactions relating to the over-the-corner market would be governed by the whole of the investor protection framework which the Bill seeks to provide. Similarly, the listed market and transactions in other securities would be subject to the conduct of business rules and would be open only to authorised investment businesses. That would apply also to transactions in this market. Those general provisions are at the heart of the legislation's investor protection framework. That is why there is no specific provision in clause 134, which deals with prospectuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are absolutely committed to adequate investor protection in this market, particularly for the sort of investor to whom the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) has referred. The Bill's range of provisions aim to secure that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot tell the hon. Lady which SRO will be ultimately responsible for regulating the market. That would not be a matter for me, or for the Secretary of State. It would be up to the designated agency, if powers were transferred, to recognise the appropriate SRO. Nor can I tell the hon. Lady about any proposed changes to some of the criteria to determine companies' eligibility for the unlisted securities market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause contains the general duty of disclosure in prospectuses for unlisted securities and reflects closely the provisions of clause 121. Clause 135 is similarly based on the listing particulars directive, although the directive has no application to unlisted securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is similar to those which my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) and I tabled to clause 121. It requires all material facts to be disclosed, if they are not of a general nature, and apart from information which is likely to be generally available to subscribers or their professional advisers. That includes any information otherwise available to the markets—if any—on which the securities are, or will be, traded. Such disclosure is also subject to limitations in respect of information which is held by someone who is not free to disclose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also extends clause 135 to require disclosure information relating to relevant third parties, such as guarantors and companies into which the securities offered are convertible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend was most helpful when we considered similar amendments to clause 121 and I hope that he will now be equally helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points which arise here, both on the clause and the amendments, are very much the same as those which arose on clause 121. I have difficulty with the removal of any reference to the clause 134 rules, as I did to the removal of the analogous reference to listing rules in clause 121. I have no difficulty with the other elements in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential object, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) pointed out in his perspective intervention last Thursday, is to enjoin the same standard of disclosure in both listing particulars and other prospectuses. I am willing to pursue consultations with a view to accommodating the reasonable anxieties underlying the amendments and, if appropriate, introducing amendments or a new clause at a later stage.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for moving the amendments so succinctly. I have some difficulty with amendment No. 342, but on the other amendments I am happy to give my hon. Friend the assurances for which he asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 342 has been tabled purely to ensure consistency with other provisions in the Bill where the expression "subscribed for" appears in conjunction with "acquired".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That most perceptive point compels me to deal at somewhat greater length with the anxieties underlying these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer back to clause 124 where the philosophy underlying clause 137 first appeared. The virtual identity of the existing clauses and of the amendments that have been proposed to each of them, demonstrates that my hon. Friends in whose names the amendments stand subscribe to the fundamental aim of putting liability for derelictions in listing particulars and prospectuses on the same footing, and forming a coherent whole to replace the fragmentation and anomalies of the existing law. The argument, I hope and believe, is about means rather than ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are only two specific matters that I wish to raise on the amendments. On amendment No. 342, I do not believe that the importation from section 67(1) of the Companies Act fits the wording of clause 137(2). In the Companies Act provision, the context gives
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
"subscribed" the meaning of "acquired", but in a provision that already includes "acquired", the insertion of "subscribed" before it suggests that a person could have a claim for compensation before he had actually sustained any loss. I do not believe that that can have been the intention of my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could put it in after "acquired" in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt that would give rise to different consequences, but I do not think that they would be any more desirable than the consequences of putting the word in the place in which it is presently to be found in the amendment tabled to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second, and more serious, matter to which I should refer is that amendment No. 340 removes the reference to information that is required to be included in a prospectus by rules under clause 134. It thereby debars compensation for omissions, unless they amount to non-compliance with the general duty of clause 135.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I doubt whether my hon. Friends, who have drawn extensively on the Companies Act, intended to oust liability for the equivalent of a contravention of section 56(1). If they did, I must beg to differ from that objective, but if they did not, there is much in the amendments to which I have no objection in principle. I am willing to try to accommodate the underlying concerns, and, if appropriate, to bring forward a new clause on Report. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield will be willing to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, and on the basis of what he said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>TAKEOVER OFFERS:
<br><br><!-- lb --> PROVISIONS SUBSTITUTED FOR SECTIONS 428, 429 AND 430 OF COMPANIES ACT 1985</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 160, line 40, leave out "person making the offer' and insert "offeror".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendments No. 368 to 398.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with highly technical matters relating to the treatment of dissentient minority shareholders in the aftermath of a takeover bid. Therefore, the provisions are about clearing up after a takeover bid has been decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present rules under sections 428 and 430 of the Companies Act enable an offeror company that has secured acceptances from the holders of at least 90 per cent of the target company's shares—excluding shares held by it or its subsidiary—to buy out the dissentients;
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
they also enable the dissentients to require the offeror company to buy them out once it holds 90 per cent of the shares, including those held by it and its subsidiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle underlying the provisions is that the rights of dissentients should be adequately safeguarded; that they should be able to resist compulsory acquisition on the terms offered if they have reasonable cause for doing so; and that they should otherwise be treated no less fairly than those shareholders who accepted the offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions in the schedule improve the position of dissentients by toughening up the definition of the 90 per cent threshold triggering the offeror's right to buy them out so as to exclude shares held by persons acting in concert, and his associates in general, and not just subsidiary companies. It goes on to alter the timetable governing the process of compulsory acquisition so that dissentients are informed of their rights earlier and allowed to exercise them without undue delay; and enourages dissentients with an arguable case to take it to the courts, by protecting them against orders for costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and above those provisions, the schedule represents a real attempt to bring the law into line with current practice and to remedy the deficiencies and inadequacies of current provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a detailed and complex matter, and it is important that the provisions should be clear as possible. For that reason there are a large number of amendments, but most are technical or clarify points of detail. All reflect the views of the many people consulted on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still in touch with the Law Society and other organisations which may wish to suggest further amendments in due course. It has been suggested that new section 429(8) goes too far in treating shares which an offeror acquires, or contracts to acquire after the offer has been made, as falling outside the scope of the offer. It was suggested that we should instead include them, while safeguarding the position of dissentients by guaranteeing them the benefit of the highest price paid for the shares, if that price is higher than the terms of the offer. We are inclined to adopt that approach, which would give statutory effect to one of the provisions of the takeover code and we shall bring forward a suitable amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept this large group of amendments and will agree that this is the appropriate opportunity to clarify the position on takeover offers which a number of professional groups outside the House feel to be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say at the outset that the Opposition generally welcome the provisions of schedule 10, and agree with the Minister's desire for the rules to be drafted as accurately as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a little unusual for the Committee to be asked to debate quite such a large number of amendments at the same time, but we accept that almost all are purely technical or are correcting drafting errors. However, would the Minister comment on what seems to me to be the slightly opaque wording of amendment No. 398? The amendment is perhaps intended to cover much of the ground at present covered by section 428(3) which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>871</span>
is replaced by a different provision in an earlier amendment, but I do not understand exactly what balance is to be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original provision seemed to make it clear that securities which were convertible, or options which could be exercised, were to be regarded as the equivalent of shares, and therefore as coming within the category of shares for which a bid had to be made under section 428(1). The amended provision seems to leave the matter a little less clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) an undertaking that, in the light of the number of amendments in the group, I am happy for my officials to make available to him well in advance of the Report stage the import of the consultations that have taken place. I think that the position is clearer now than it was a few weeks ago. In the interests of open government I tell the hon. Gentleman that he can have the data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about amendment No. 398. The amendment adds a new section 430F which replaces what was section 428(2). New section 428(1) repeats its original provisions and extends the operation of compulsory acquisition provisions to securities, other than shares, that are convertible into shares or give a right to subscribe to shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 428(2) is new, but is simply a clarification provision. Obviously it was not successful in its aim, but it seeks to ensure that offers for such securities are treated as a class of their own. As a result, the 90 per cent threshold would have to be satisfied in respect of that class of securities, separately from other shares that are also subject to the takeover bid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those remarks reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are genuinely attempting to clarify matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt about the genuineness of the attempt. The question is whether it is successful. The Minister has resolved the doubt in my mind at least. However, there is a peculiar tension between subsections (1) and (2) of section 428 which seem to be working in opposite directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that by tabling the amendment the Minister has acceded to the arguments of such bodies as the Law Society which said that the original provisions of section 428(1) and (2) produced an outcome that was perhaps not intended. The amendment, therefore, seems to make it clear that section 428(1) when read in conjunction with what was section 428(2) no longer requires convertible stock, options and so on to be counted as part of the shares for which the bid was made. If the Minister could confirm that point, I at least would be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct in his assumption. He is also correct in spotting that this proposal was suggested by the Law Society—most specifically—and by others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will also feel that it is better that the amendments are tabled now while the Committee can consider them—albeit in large numbers—at leisure, rather than wait until late at night on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to endorse the comment of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). We now have the opportunity of looking at the amended provisions before Report and of thinking of ways in which they could be further improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a more general question for the Minister on the schedule as a whole, following representations from the Law Society and others, but it may be better to leave that until the stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Tenth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to continue the discussion that the Minister and I were having a moment ago. I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's general remarks on the representations of the Law Society and others, and what I took as his general undertaking that the attitude of the Government, as represented by the schedule as amended, is not yet concrete and that further considerations may be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the slightly difficult position of having received this morning a series of representations and comments from the Law Society on these provisions. I have done my best to understand what the society is driving at, and some of the amendments that we have just accepted appear to have recognised the Law Society's arguments. However, the Law Society makes other points which appear to me at first blush to have some merit of which the Minister has not yet taken account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be unfair to the Minister. This is a long schedule and one could go through it in a nit picking way selecting points of detail to embarrass the Minister, but there are several interesting aspects. For example, the Law Society suggested that new section 429(3) would benefit from the addition of the words
	<br><q><p>"by virtue of acceptance of the offer"</p></q>
to make it clear that the shares acquired by or contracted for by the offeror were not obtained in ordinary market dealings and that they were obtained by virtue of his offer. I assume that that is what the provision is intended to mean. Will the Minister comment on the desirability of so amending the provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that argument is too detailed to be answered now, perhaps the Minister will undertake to examine the question and let me know later. The Law Society and others may wish to make similar points which have not yet been taken into account. If the Minister intends to consider them we can safely leave the matter in his hands. Otherwise we may have to examine it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Dagen-ham (Mr. Gould) that we are motivated to get it exactly right, in line with the comments made on this complex subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has the advantage of me in that, as far as I can ascertain, my officials have not yet had

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
a chance to work out a response to the representations which he received this morning. No doubt we also received them this morning. We are in touch with the Law Society and other organisations with the objective of getting the measure entirely right in good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when I have digested what the hon. Member for Dagenham has already digested we can come back to him in good time with any further comments on the latest representations. I am sorry that I cannot give him a detailed answer this morning, but I undertake to do so in good time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's difficulty fully. I cannot pretend to grasp completely the import of all the Law Society's arguments. If I wished to be unfair I could go through them seriatim and challenge the Minister to give me an off-the-cuff reply to each, but I do not propose to do so. No doubt the Minister or his officials will receive a copy of the document in due course. It will obviously arrive too late for amendments to be introduced in Committee, but if the Minister will write to me later or give me some idea of his attitude to the representations he may save us time on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what is obviously a very fluid situation I should tell the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that I now understand that the Law Society has received a response to the suggestions of which it advised him this morning and that it is satisfied with the Government's proposals. As far as I can see, the Law Society is already happy on the clutch of issues of which the hon. Member for Dagenham was made aware this morning. However, as I said earlier, in the interests of total clarity we are happy to give the hon. Member an account of those exchanges and of their result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would let me have notes as well. I entirely endorse the general trend and I am delighted that the Government's response on those important matters has been accepted by the Law Society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hearing the news from the Conservative Benches, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will be ultra-cautious in accepting any assurance on that basis. There has clearly been another dirty deal between the Law Society and the Government. Perhaps Lord Hailsham is hovering in the Corridor in his usual capacity as the provisional wing of the Law Society, issuing instructions and messages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to take to heart the caution ary words of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). I assure my hon. Friend that I was a little less happy with the Minister's last remarks than with those he made earlier because I thought that I heard the echo of the clanging of a door. There was a note of finality that was not present earlier. The Minister gave the Committee the impression that the negotiations between the Government and the Law Society—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister gave the impression that those negotiations had been satisfactorily concluded, but that Committee members were not yet able to know the outcome. That is a little less satisfactory than I had hoped. For example, it prompts me to ask in respect of the precise point that I raised about new section 429(3), why the Government have decided not to include in the provision the limitation for which the Law Society originally argued. Are those words unnecessary or misdirected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) sets out the time limits governing the right to expropriate. The first requirement is that the 90 per cent threshold must be reached within four months of the offer being made. That is unchanged. The purpose of the requirement is to ensure that offers cannot remain open indefinitely and leave dissentient shareholders in a state of uncertainty about whether they might be bought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second requirement is that an offeror must give notice that he intends to take over the shares of the minority within two months of the 90 per cent threshold being reached. The two months period for giving notice is unchanged but, under the present provisions of section 428(2), the notice may not be issued before the end of the four-month period, regardless of the point in time at which 90 per cent acceptances are achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unsatisfactory as it imposes an unnecessary delay in cases where the 90 per cent requirement is satisfied before the end of the four months. When the 90 per cent has been achieved, it is in everyone's best interests that the process of compulsory acquisition should proceed as quickly as possible. There is no point in requiring all the parties concerned to sit on their hands until the four months expire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments take into account the Law Society's memorandum, after discussion with the society. It agreed that some drafting points were not necessary, but we are still discussing those issues with it and, if it wishes to take any of those points further, we are willing to think again. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my further commitment that the Law Society will have been well and truly consulted both inside and outside the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the aim of the provision, and I accept that. Like the Law Society, I was anxious about the process by which the shares were acquired, but I am happy with the Minister's comments about the possibility of further consultations. The Law Society may find that it has sufficient time between now and Report to ensure that those points are adequately aired, and, if necessary, we can always come back on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
to clarify the point dealing with insider dealing in relation to the new position when we have established dual capacity after the big bang.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, we have single capacity where brokers and jobbers operate separately. Nevertheless, brokers' analysts hold lunches and visits to firms for selected clients. No doubt—otherwise such events would have no purpose—price-sensitive information that is not generally available passes between the parties of such tight groups. In a perfect situation, that would not happen. However, newspapers often report that a firm's shares have gone up after a broker's lunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory that important information is available only to a small group of investors. If there is abuse—abuse may be too strong a word, but there are worrying activities—matters could get considerably worse after the big bang. We would have to depend on the impermeability of the Chinese walls between operators within firms to ensure that such information did not move across from brokers to market makers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what steps might be taken by the SIB to deal with this matter? There are two ways of dealing with the problem. The first is that analysts' contacts with firms should not take place except during the period shortly after the annual accounts are published when the information is generally known. The second is the practice, similar to that in the United States, where such meetings take place in the presence of lawyers, and if price-sensitive information changes hands it is immediately published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister recognise that problem and will he say what rules the SIB should institute to ensure that such matters will not seriously damage the small investor and that the information will be available to all in the market place rather than to the more powerful few?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was encouraged by what the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) said to think he might support an amendment to clause 147 which would give the SIB a role in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 144(2) offers a definition of a market maker. Clause 155 has similar terms. Paragraph 17(l)(a) of schedule 1 also defines a market maker, but uses different language. It refers to people who transact "generally and continuously". Is there a reason for the difference in language between that paragraph and the odd phrase "at all normal times" in clauses 144 and 155?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried about what the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) said. Some brokers take the initiative of talking to companies about their activities and report that information to their clients. They are doing their job better for their clients than other brokers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that those brokers and companies must immediately publish everything that passed between them? Such information would be available to anyone else talking to companies. Those brokers do so to benefit their clients. If such information must be generally published, they will not bother to take such initiatives and some people will be less well-informed than they otherwise might be. There is a danger in requiring full disclosure of everything in the way that has been suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>878</span>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expressed concern about the present position, but I should not wish to see it altered. Of course brokers provide the service described by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). I am worried—I do not deny it—that such information as is available tends to be available to the larger investor rather than the smaller one, and that the larger investors are the ones who are invited to the lunches, the visits and so on. That suggests an inequitable position that must worry the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am trying to make does not relate to the broker and his client, but rather to the post-27 October big bang, where there may be a leakage of information between the broker or the broker's analyst and the market maker. That elevates the problem to a higher level, and one that is more open to abuse. The only defence that we have against it is the impermeability of the Chinese walls within a firm. I am sure that the Minister will recognise that although those Chinese walls may be impermeable to start with, there may be a leakage in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to recognise the scale of the problem, and I hope that he will tell us what he would wish to see instituted as rules of the SIB— obviously it is not a matter to be brought within the legislation—to ensure that such things do not happen. I am pressing him for that, rather than for a change in the current position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) about Chinese walls and I share his anxieties. I have always believed them to be a highly inadequate mechanism and I too will be interested to hear what my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary says about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little worried when the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) referred to the American experience. It would be unfortunate if we were to reach the stage where brokers and research analysts could not meet companies without having lawyers present. That would be an unhelpful development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall the case of a company in the United States called Equity Funding, which was the subject of a massive fraud that was initially uncovered by a diligent broker's analyst. The fraud would probably have continued for considerably longer had it not been for the analyst, who was clearly motivated by the desire to be able to give his clients better information than anybody else could. As I recall, the analyst got into some trouble for doing exactly that, because the circumstances were so dramatic and the subsequent collapse of the company so rapid that he was in some difficulty with the insider dealing provisions in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be very careful about going too far down that route, but I entirely endorse the points that have been made by both the hon. Member for Yeovil and my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) about the problem of dual capacity and the test to which the very dubious Chinese walls will be put. However, I should say to the hon. Member for Yeovil that even if there were provision for lawyers to be present and for complete disclosure to take place
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>879</span>
when a broker's analyst was meeting with a company, the very fact that such a meeting—which may reveal good or bad news about that company that would then become generally available—was scheduled for two or three weeks time may become known to the market makers within the same organisation and may put them in possession of information that would be useful as they prepared their book ahead of that meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the big bang is coming at the end of a massive bull market—or, perhaps not at the end, but after a sustained bull market—and there is no doubt that the concept of Chinese walls will be put to a much tougher test when we get into a bear market, when companies are in financial difficulties, and the temptations to blur some of the distinctions will become very great indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause seeks simply to make paving provisions for changes that are yet to be made in the stock exchange rules to deal with the change in the regime that will follow big bang. The intention is not to water down the law, but simply to redefine those to whom the existing exemption applies. I might add that analysts would not be exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government share the anxiety expressed by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and my hon Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). They have identified an important matter, which will have to be the subject of careful consideration. However, I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil will understand if I decline his invitation to suggest the precise way in which the designated agency or the self-regulating organisations may address the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil pointed out that there are several possible approaches to the problem. The designated agency and SROs would wish to look carefully at those that have been adopted in the United States and elsewhere, and also, I hope to come up with some ideas of their own from their experience of how our markets work. They will thus arrive at the most effective way of dealing with what is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for drawing the Committee's attention to the distinction between the definitions in schedule 1 and clause 144. The former is for the purpose of authorisation and the latter is for the purpose of exempting some authorised persons, namely designated market makers, from the insider dealing offence. I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's point and explains the difference between the definitions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 147 empowers the Secretary of State to appoint inspectors to investigate suspected insider dealing offences and to give them powers to examine suspects and witnesses on oath and to require the production of papers and documents. My amendment seeks to extend that power of the Secretary of State to the Securities and Investments Board, which is now the statutorily recognised body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insider dealing was made a criminal offence in the Companies Act 1980, which was consolidated in the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985. Since 1980, about 80 cases of possible insider dealing have been reported to the Department of Trade and Industry, but only eight people have been prosecuted, of whom only four have been convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason for the small number of prosecutions and convictions has been the difficulty of obtaining sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the suspect dealt in the securities while he possessed information that he knew to be both unpublished and price sensitive. Because of that difficulty the White Paper included an announcement of the intention to strengthen the investigator's hands by giving them powers similar to those of inspectors appointed under section 432 of the Companies Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are sound and compelling agruments for not only supporting the powers provided in clause 147, but extending them to the Securities and Investments Board. The powers given are wide, but they need to be. Insider dealing materially damages the interest of investors. It is rife, and it is most certainly insidious. It was for those reasons that it became a criminal offence in 1980 and those of us who were involved with the Companies Act that dealt with the matter recognised then that there was a limit to the extent to which we could stamp out the practice simply by legislation. But experience has shown, not only because of the small number of prosecutions and convictions, but because of the substantial and volatile movements of some shares prior to bids or announcements of results, that there has almost certainly been substantial insider dealing that the legislation has not caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise that there is a limit to how far we can go by simply passing a law and making a criminal offence of an activity that is exceedingly difficult to uncover or to prove, the deterrent provided by a watchdog that has a day-to-day responsibility for supervision in the market place anyway will enhance the powers that the Secretary of State already enjoys. At present, the stock exchange often reports suspicious circumstances to the Department of Trade and Industry, for example, where there have been volatile
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>881</span>
movements in share prices. The Secretary of State can appoint competent people—often officials of the stock exchange—to undertake an inquiry to ascertain whether insider dealing has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But insider dealing may often take place where there have not been suspicious movements in the share price before the announcement of a bid or a dramatic change in the results of a company. For example, an individual can make a killing in a share without there being any demonstrable movements in the share price before the announcement. An individual can buy or sell a substantial number of shares in a company of the size of Imperial—I have not chosen that example with any significance, although it is subject to a takeover bid at present—without that having any demonstrable impact on the share price on that day. Thereafter, when a bid is made for the company or a dramatic announcement of results is announced to which that person was privy beforehand, there is no evidence available to the stock exchange or to the market generally that insider dealing has taken place, yet the individual could have dealt inside and could have made considerable amounts of money.

So there is, and always will be even if my amendment is accepted, a limit on the extent to which cases of insider dealing are apparent, but in trying to prevent such instances arising, I maintain that having a watchdog body and a process of supervision responsible on a day-to-day basis for looking into those markets and staying close to the individuals and firms and investment managers responsible for handling such large sums of money, will provide a far better chance of deterring such activities and identifying them when they arise. The individuals concerned with that supervision and, subsequently for investigation, will not be in Victoria street as the Department of Trade and Industry is, but will be based in the City with a day-to-day responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Securities and Investments Board should have that concurrent power because not only is it closer to the market on a day-to-day basis than is the Department of Trade and Industry, but, following the amendment made to clause 96, it is a statutory body. Even if it were not, that responsibility should still be placed on the SIB. However, I would understand his reasons if my hon. and learned Friend the Minister were reluctant to include such a power, as he has stated that he intends to return the designated agency to the status of a private regulatory body. Even so, most people think that the SIB will be able to supervise these matters and, as it has the statutory authority and the expertise to do so, it is entirely reasonable that it should have these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason for the extension. Under the provisions of the regulatory framework, the Securities and Investments Board will be responsible for authorising persons to conduct investment business, quite separately from those who gain authorisation under an SRO. In those instances, SIB will be far more capable of supervising the day-to-day activities and practices within companies directly authorised by SIB because the stock exchange, for example, will be much less able or willing to investigate those cases where the persons concerned are not authorised under that SRO. Because SIB has that separate and direct power of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
authorisation for persons and businesses, it should also have, concurrently with the Secretary of State, the authority to investigate suspected cases of insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the powers which the Secretary of State has taken upon himself in the Bill, but it should be accorded to SIB. It is a deficiency if it is excluded. When we come to the powers of prosecution, I shall argue that SIB should have a right not only to investigate, but to prosecute. But, in the meantime, we shall look at those matters individually, and, even without that power of prosecution, SIB is able and competent, and should be empowered to undertake such investigations. The fact that the Department of Trade and Industry may appoint officials within the stock exchange to undertake the mechanics of an investigation shows that it is not unreasonable for SIB to authorise those officials to undertake an investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my main argument is that, by accepting the amendment, we shall send yet another sign to the City and to investors at large that we mean business about serious malpractices, and intend to see the law passed in 1980 administered more effectively in the City. For those reasons, there is everything to commend the amendment. If my hon. and learned Friend thinks that there are arguments against it, I fear that he will give succour and comfort to those who, undoubtedly, have made killings in recent years, as they will be able to continue to do so, especially during such a high and rising stock market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse strongly every word of the speech of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). Like him, I hope that his hon. and learned Friend the Minister will accept the amendment, but it may help the Committee if I make it clear that, if the Minister did not do that and the hon. Gentleman pressed the matter, Opposition Members would support him in a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to speak at length, as the case has been made powerfully, but the hon. Member for Chichester was right to say that this is one aspect of the City's operations which must be put right. It is the one aspect in respect of which anxiety has been mounting for a long time and, rightly, legislative intervention has been found necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members welcome the provisions of clause 147 and I accept that they should provide a substantial step forward in the authorities' ability to deal with insider trading. But there is no doubt that the measures taken so far have been simply inadequate, and there is ample evidence—I wish that it were not the case—that even the aspects of insider trading of which we know have become more common. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point when he said that there may be considerable insider dealing for which there is no discernible evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two or three weeks ago, I was alarmed, as no doubt other Committee members were, at reports that, especially in the climate engendered by the tremendous number of takeover bids at present, insider dealing had reached new levels and was relying, to some extent, on new techniques through the use of offshore companies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>883</span>
and nominee shareholdings, for example. That is why I am especially keen on some of the provisions in clause 147. I hope that the Minister will tell us how effective he thinks that the new powers will be dealing with that substantial and worrying new development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of insider dealing and the ineffectiveness of the means of bringing it under control suggest not only that there is a deficiency in the powers of investigation—that is certainly true—but that we may not be asking the right people to do the job. I believe that that is the question to which the hon. Member for Chichester was referring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable merit in setting up a Securities and Investments Board to regulate the City and so there must be merit in giving it such power. I intend no slight on the abilities of officials in the Department, but the SIB is asked to undertake those responsibilities precisely because it is closer to the ground and understands more acutely what is going on in the market place. Here, as with so many areas covered by the Bill, it is right that the SIB should have at least concurrent jurisdiction and power. The amendments of the hon. Member for Chichester are entirely on the right lines and should be supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may object that, given his intention of reconstituting the SIB as a private company, which we regret and will do our best to frustrate, it would be inappropriate to give the SIB a power with which, as the hon. Member for Chichester said, the power to prosecute goes hand-in-hand. That argument would strengthen my case for leaving the SIB as a body identified in statute and with a statutory identity, but no doubt we shall debate the issue at our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may also be objected that if the SIB were given powers under clause 147, it might find itself dealing with, and exercising jurisdiction over, persons who were not authorised for the purposes of the Bill, which would be an innovation extending beyond what had hitherto been regarded as the general ambit of the SIB's powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is tempted to advance that argument, I hope that he will think carefully about whether it is as strong as it appears. Professor Gower made it clear in his report that he thought that it would be a mistake to limit the SIB to the process of authorisation and to the area covered by authorisation, and that there was a role for the SIB on matters such as insider dealing, the issues covered by part V, takeover bids and so on. Perhaps we shall discuss those topics when we debate new clauses at our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not close his mind to what many of us regard as a proper and useful extension of the SIB's powers on the almost doctrinal ground that the SIB must be limited to areas where people are authorised for the purposes of the Bill. The general case for setting up a Securities and Investments Board surely extends here, and we should not be deterred because there may be the odd professional adviser who is not an authorised person and who will not fall within the net cast by SIB under this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the provision is to work as well as it should, there is a strong case, which was put admirably by the hon. Member for Chichester, for giving those powers to the body best placed to exercise them effectively, which I believe is the SIB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is undoubtedly widespread public concern about the prevalence of insider dealing. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) has drawn attention to the fact that, although the stock exchange has referred 80 cases to the Department of Trade and Industry since the enactment of the Companies Act 1980, there have been few prosecutions and even fewer convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reason, I support the proposals in the three paragraphs in chapter 14 of the White Paper on insider dealing which are designed to increase the scope of the law or to increase the powers of the Department of Trade and Industry to investigate possible breaches to the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need to support the amendment is illustrated by an example drawn from the extension of the law. At present, the law does not extend to the traded options market and extends only to the underlying securities. To take the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, it is not necessary for someone who wants to indulge in insider dealing to invest in the underlying stock. The most effective route from every aspect may be simply to buy the necessary options in the stock. The profit that accrues will be much more highly geared than that produced by investment in the underlying stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that the SIB may investigate the affairs of an authorised investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could therefore investigate a member of the stock exchange which was an investment business authorised by that route. If the SIB came across the possibility of insider dealing it would have to cease its investigation and ask the Department of Trade and Industry to take over, because the SIB would not have the power to continue its investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People outside will not understand. They will expect the SIB, which is to have the dual role of investor protection and market development, to have a comprehensive range of powers. The only reason why the Bill did not give the SIB those powers was its private company status. Now that the Bill recognises the board, it is appropriate that we should give the board those powers. It needs a comprehensive range of powers to command the respect of investors and to have the necessary authority to carry out its work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an erudite article in today's 	<i>Financial Times</i> the author says:
	<br><q><p>"Most members of the public who follow these matters assumed that the framework of investor protection would provide adequate powers of investigation, enforcement and prosecution. But the Bill falls short on what is needed because the Government was not prepared to give such powers to a private sector regulator. Now that the SIB is a recognised statutory body the way is clear for it to be given these powers which the Minister has seen fit to confer on himself in the Bill."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on their sagacity and courage in proposing the amendments. They have shown genuine concern for the integrity of British financial institutions and of the City in general. That is what motivates their determination to take a dissenting line. They have the real interests of the City at heart in proposing the amendment.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>885</span>
The fate of the amendment clearly depends on how much support they receive from Conservative Members. The ominous signs are there. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is still with us so we must take the cash in hand and waive the rest. I am afraid that that bodes ill for the amendment, but I hope that it succeeds. Opposition Members should support it because it is an important step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a only one serious problem with the fact that the stock exchange is an SRO, but it is likely to become worse. It needs dealing with because, as the hon. Member for Chichester said, there is a general feeling that the measures taken so far are unsatisfactory. It is thought that people are getting away with insider trading and with making money on a considerable scale, that nothing is being done and that the authorities are impotent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong argument for taking further, tougher measures to deal with what is becoming a scandal and an affront to the small investor whom the Government and, indeed, the Opposition wish to encourage. If we are to have the people's capitalism which has been proclaimed as an objective by the Government and which is obviously important in spreading wider financial involvement and the ownership of shares, it becomes even more important to stamp out insider trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the know are getting away with enormous profits, by a species of fraud, and doing it at the expense of the small investor. That produces, inevitably, a feeling of alienation towards the financial institutions which allow that to happen and in which he feels a general air of putrescence that communicates itself to him. The small investor is therefore put off investing. He knows that he will not get away with such activities, but sees that other people do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is likely to become more important as competition gets tougher after the big bang. The portents are becoming even more ominous. Recent figures showing the rises in share prices before the announcement of takeover bids were extremely depressing. In nearly every case the major rise came before the bid was actually announced—a clear indication that insider trading was taking place on a considerable scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those figures apply now, the problem will be even worse when competition is tougher and more intense, and there is more pressure to cut corners when some institutions will fall between the different SROs on the margins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just had a message saying, "The hon. Member for Stafford is nodding his head in agreement. My heart's a flutter." I am not quite sure what that means, but I pass it on for the information of the Committee. It is a little insider trading in action, perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can see how serious insider trading will become when the market becomes more competitive, the market becomes international and institutions may fall between differernt SROs. It is important that SIB should have the powers, both as a matter of right and symbolically, as they would strengthen it, give it a clear importance, and register a determination to deal with the problem.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done, and the relevant institution to have the powers and the teeth is the SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members will not want praise from the Opposition, but they are going to get it none the less. Those are arguments in favour of the attempts by the hon. Members for Chichester and Beaconsfield to transform the nature of SIB and allow it the powers. These amendments form a package and stand or fall together and constitute a further argument for the earlier amendment made to the nature of the SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those grounds, Opposition Members support the amendment, because the "people" part of "people's capitalism" stand to be defrauded unless firm action is taken and seen to be taken here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the idea behind the amendment, in the sense that it is most important that we are seen to be taking effective action about fraud in the City and insider dealing. There is however a world of difference between doing those things in a manner that is consistent with the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985, section 8(2) of which says,
	<br><q><p>"Proceedings for an offence … shall not be instituted in England and Wales except by the Secretary of State or by, or with the consent of, the Director of Public Prosecutions."</p></q>
That provision stipulates the basis on which proceed ings have to be taken, and the arrangements proposed to invoke the putative statutory body, SIB, as one which may prosecute—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Investigate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —investigate, and also take a matter to the point at which there would be a prosecution. There are serious difficulties in the route proposed by my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and Chichester (Mr. Nelson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 147, if amended, would read:
	<br><q><p>"If it appears to the Secretary of State or the Securities Investments Board that there are circumstances"</p></q>
and so on. If the amendment were passed, both parties would be empowered to make a judgment on whether investigations into insider dealings should operate. That would be a difficult, if not impossible, position. It would be unwise to assume that the SIB has been given statutory status because the Bill is not yet enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is worried that the Secretary of State and the SIB may have identical powers, why did he not object to the provisions in clause 96(5) which provides exactly that in relation to the powers of investigation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When that matter was considered I was not here. My hon. Friend should not ask hypothetical questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB is not yet a statutory body. It may be unfruitful to take the amendment to a vote, but I understand its objective. We have to show that the City is not just operating in a symbolic fashion, but that prosecutions will take place. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend is determined that when investigations into insider dealings are required action will be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>887</span>
amendments. These matters deserve serious consideration. I deeply share their worry about the offence of insider dealing, as does the Committee and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours (Workington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Empty words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should consider the powers provided in clause 147. Those wide-ranging powers show the Government's earnest concern. I have described them as draconian. They take away the fundamental principle of criminal law: the right of someone not to incriminate himself. Those investigating these matters would have the power to ask questions of those suspected of such an offence, who would be obliged to answer on pain of being punished for contempt of court. The answers given in those circumstances may be used against them in criminal proceedings. Those are far-reaching, draconian powers. When they were considered, there was apprehension that they were so draconian that they would meet with substantial opposition because, in taking away the right to avoid self-incrimination, they were excessive, even having regard to the nature of the mischief with which they are intended to deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. and learned Friend say whether there has in fact been sustained opposition, because I am not aware of any?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) that such opposition has not so far surfaced. We were very worried about the matter and—despite any apprehension—the Bill provides powers that are far-reaching, draconian, and the greatest possible demonstration of the Government's anxiety. I hope that those outside who listen to this debate will appreciate—as all those here appreciate—that there are powers and that the argument in this Committee is not whether there should be powers or whether they go far enough, but who should exercise those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the Miniser is saying, but if I may rephrase his last sentence, it seems to me that what we—and the Minister's hon. Friends— are worried about is not so much who should exercise the powers, but how, at what point, and in what circumstances, they should be brought into play. It is all very well having the powers in the clause; we want to make sure that those with their ears to the ground, who are close to the situation and who know what is going on, have the opportunity to bring them into play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the proposition at the heart of the question that is posed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), my reason for that brings me to the example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, with which I was going to deal later. My hon. Friend said that those who are close to the market would not themselves be able to pursue a suspicion, or evidence, of insider dealing there and then. They would have to refer it to the Secretary of State so that the powers that are entrusted to him under clause 147 could be exercised. But in almost all cases, that would effectively be the position—though with a change in the dramatis personae—if the amendment were carried. The people with their ears close to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
ground are the SROs, and, even if the amendment were carried, they would have to put any evidence of insider dealing that they came across to someone else and would not themselves be able to pursue it there and then. The difference would be that instead of putting the matter to the Secretary of State, they would go the Securities and Investments Board. That is why I do not accept the proposition underlying the question of the hon. Member for Dagenham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely what the Minister has just said— which is accurate—supports the case made by his hon. Friends and supported by Labour Members. The whole point of having the Securities and Investments Board is that it will be more available to the SROs than the Department of Trade and Industry would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the case is made, as it surely is—the Minister has made it himself many times over—for having a Securities and Investments Board for the general regulatory purposes of the Bill, that case is equally powerful in relation to the powers to be exercised under clause 147.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I simply do not understand the basis on which the hon. Member for Dagenham says that the Securities and Investments Board will be closer to the ground than the Secretary of State. The Securities and Investments Board has different functions, and those functions are clearly envisaged when, and if, the powers of the Secretary of State are transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to reject the amendments not for any doctrinal reason, but because if these unprecedented, draconian powers are to be given, it is essential that they be exercised by a body that is accountable. That body is the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament, and it is right that the exercise of such far-reaching powers should be accountable to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That relates to the central point—the status of SIB. The Minister is arguing that he will reverse the earlier changes that were made to the Bill when it goes before the House. If those changes were to remain in force, would his attitude to the amendment be different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's question as it brings me to my next point. My argument rests in principle on the Bill in its original form. But the position would be aggravated, rather than eased, if the change made to clause 96 were to remain in force. And it would have been aggravated further by the proposed change to clause 97. Such changes would reduce still further the accountability of the designated agency. The difference in accountability between SIB and the Secretary of State would be increased and exaggerated, while the disadvantage would be reinforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I urge my hon. Friends—and, indeed, Opposition Members who are prepared to listen to arguments on accountability—to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The Minister is making a point about the provisions of accountability. Surely such powers can be delegated, and the amendments specify either the Secretary of State or SIB. So why does the Minister believe that by passing the powers over to SIB in the way proposed, the Secretary of State would lose all accountability? Can those powers not be rescinded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would enable the designated agency to exercise those powers independently. In that case the designated agency would not be accountable to Parliament and neither would the Secretary of State who would say, "These are decisions for which I am not responsible, which have been taken by this independent body over which I have limited control."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to deal with several other points. It is important to deal with the matter in the context of the power to prosecute. Although that does not arise directly from clause 147, many hon. Members have recognised its implications. The power to investigate and the power to prosecute should go together and, of course, in the Bill as drafted, they are both in the hands of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disadvantage that would result from giving the designated agency the power to prosecute—a power that several hon. Members would like it to have—is a matter to which I adverted in an earlier debate. I made a point that found favour with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). Any decisions on prosecutions are really matters requiring a particular kind of experience and expertise. That experience, which exists in the Department of Trade and Industry—a prosecuting authority—is not present in the designated agency, nor is it necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham pointed out that if the amendment were carried, the designated agency would be given powers over unauthorised businesses. Committee members should ask themselves where that would stop. There are many matters, such as the whole of company law, which could be regarded as relevant to investor protection. So it could be said equally that the designated agency should be given the power to investigate those matters, as well, because they are relevant to investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should respond to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham about the extent to which the powers in clause 147 would affect insider dealing, as it relates to offshore transactions. The problem there is not that dealing through an offshore intermediary is outside the present definition of the offence. The use of the offshore intermediary does not affect the circumstances that give rise to an offence under the 1985 Act. If the user can be identified, he is in the same position as someone who dealt through an onshore bank or broker. The problem is to identify the user, and I hope that the powers in clause 147 will help to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) asked whether those powers would be used. I assure the Committee that such draconian powers would not be in the Bill in their present form if there was no serious intention to use them as fully as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend explain whether the powers in the clause will be effective where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>890</span>
someone has dealt through an offshore account and there appears to be evidence that it was an insider deal, but it proves impossible to trace the beneficial ownership of the account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The powers in clause 147 may be exercised in respect of a person within the jurisdiction, as a party to that transaction, in so far as there is any suspicion attaching to him. That person may be asked questions which he is obliged to answer on pain of contempt, so the powers may be used in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot pretend to my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) that the powers guarantee that the problem will be eliminated. Clearly that is not possible, but they will improve the prospects of bringing such offenders to book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that merely adding SIB to the range of powers would not make a jot of difference to the point made about beneficial ownership overseas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that, but, in fairness to hon. Members who made that point, I do not think that they were relying on the amendment in that context. I think it was a rather different point, which I have sought to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the Minister himself who said that some time had been spent in the Department in discussing the extent of the powers, and whether they might be accepted. That shows people outside the House the importance that the Minister attaches to the role of the officers who might have to be appointed to investigate insider dealing, but I do not understand his answer that it reduces accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Minister secures accountability by use of the nuclear deterrent arrangements in the Bill. He keeps telling us that that is the absolute form of accountability resting in his hands. I do not see why that should not apply if SIB were allocated the responsibilities as we suggest in the amendment. I draw the conclusion that the Minister has an ideological hang up about a private SIB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may shake his head, but even Conservative Members in the House—I am not talking about committee members as I do not now what their positions are—do not understand why he has not accepted the need to be more flexible. As has been said, the 	<i>Financial Times</i> has published a series of articles drawing attention to the conundrum facing us. Indeed, journalists in other parts of the media have drawn attention to the problem that the Minister refuses to accept the case for a statutory authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, the amendments imprison the changes made to the Bill two weeks ago. Otherwise, if this and similar amendments were accepted the system would have to be dismantled as the Government recognise that they could not leave such powers in the hands of a private agency. The Minister should go back and reconsider his argument. Last week we asked for a suspension of the sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that is unfair of the Minister and of the hon. Member for Stafford

(Mr. Cash) to point out the inadequacies of successive amendments in the light of the change effected in Committee? Surely all members of the Committee know that those of us who supported the original amendment saw it as simply the first instalment of a much more comprehensive series of amendments. Only in relation to the more comprehensive change would it be fair to refer to inconsistencies and inadequacies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the stance of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is that he argues every case on the basis that the Bill's original provisions still stand. He cannot accept that there has been an amendment. The status of the amendment is greater than that of the original proposition, yet the hon. Member for Stafford and the Minister repeatedly assert the position based on the original proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a few words about the arrangements for staffing. My understanding is that if a complaint is made, the Minister will appoint one or two of his officials—the Bill refers to
	<br><q><p>"one or more competent inspectors"—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>to investigate a particular area of activity.</p></q>
In practice SIB as the designated agency would have to submit a report to the Department of Trade and Industry. Unless the information came by another route, SIB would have to set out its reasons for believing that inspectors should be appointed to carry out the inquiries. Perhaps the Minister will intervene if I am wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to intervene if the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) invites me to do so. The system could work as the hon. Gentleman described, but, as I sought to point out, the SRO would be more likely than SIB to detect the need for further investigation. The SRO would face the precise task that the hon. Gentleman identified, irrespective of whether it passed the information to SIB or to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are different options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) accept that many authorised businesses will not come under an SRO? They will have a direct line of accountability with the SIB. In those circumstances it is no answer to suggest that responsibility will be subsumed by the SRO. It will not, and the SRO will have no locus standi in investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those businesses with a direct relationship will rely on SIB to make a report if complaints are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system assumes that the Department will always have officials available for investigations and that if officials are not available they must be drawn off other work in the Department. If that is not the case I am sure that the Minister will correct me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So there will be a permanent group of people or a secretariat within the Department responsible for carrying out such inquiries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to turn the debate into what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is accustomed to referring to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
as a tutorial, I am happy to respond. The Secretary of State could appoint anyone as an inspector for the purposes of these investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the Minister could appoint someone from outside his Department to carry out the inquiries. The Department of Trade and Industry would have to hold a meeting to establish whether it had sufficient evidence in a report or from conversations to justify an appointment being made and inquiry being carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot for the life to me see why the Minister does not accept that it is much easier to leave that responsibility with SIB. It cuts out the whole question of conversation and consultation, the need to supply documents and for DTI officials to spend time in meetings deciding whether they should appoint people to carry out further investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minister shakes his head, but surely that will be the case. It would be much easier if SIB were responsible for carrying out these investigations whenever it thought fit, and I should like SIB to develop an atmosphere of consciousness of the need for permanent monitoring and guarding against these activities. Within SIB, conversations would take place regularly about these matters and it would be recognised that the very people involved— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Civil servants may find that amusing but we are living in the real world. In the real world that is how things happen. We are talking about organisations and the way that people chat and discuss what they are going to do tomorrow morning, and whether they should go in and inquire about a particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is much better that it should be in that form than that some silly report should have to be submitted to the Secretary of the State in the hope that he may be willing to designate a particular officer, or appoint someone from outside, to carry out an investigation or inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have been exaggerating my case for the purposes of my argument, but that procedure will lead to confusion, whereas the SIB procedure would be far easier, more sensible and more productive. When SIB people were seen in SROs or in the stock exchange they would be recognised as those with power to carry out investigations, instead of some grey official or other obscure appointee that the Secretary of State, obscure in Whitehall, chooses to carry out inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the question of beneficial ownership, which I appreciate is not directly affected by the amendments, but has been raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the main obstacle to effective investigation of insider trading is the inability to establish where the trading originated. I am sure that the stock exchange would confirm that a large number of the examples that it has detailed have run into that and.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have a leak from a Select Committee of the House, one of the 10 people who have the report gives it to a journalist, and unless the journalist is willing to say which member of the Committee passed the report
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
to him, the investigation runs into the sand. It is the same with insider trading; there may be 10 people who are privy to a takeover where one Swiss bank deals; all 10 may have had accounts with that bank—or the Panamanian company or the Liechtenstein trust or whatever it might have been. Unless the bank, or the trust, is willing to say who the beneficial owner was behind the tansactions, the investigation will fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Minister has acknowledged that the clause will not, in the last analysis, be effective. It cannot be. Will he therefore consider making rules, or getting the SIB to make rules, to ensure that where there has been an investigation that has run up against the problem, the authorised person who carried out the transaction will be prevented from carrying out any further transactions for customers who refuse to disclose the beneficial ownership behind the deals that have been investigated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) seems to think that the Minister and Conservative Member are labouring under some illusion that what we are proposing is ideological. I refute that. That whole spirit of our proceedings has been one in which both sides of the Committee have worked together constructively to produce the best possible Bill for the protection of the consumer and the development of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, an honourable intellectual difference of opinion on the subject between members of the Committee as well as between Conservative Members. Despite the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), I cannot agree with him. I consider that the flexibility encompassed in the original approach put forward by my hon. and learned Friend the Minister, particularly in the light of what is likely to happen in the City this autumn, is not only desirable but essential if we are to make progress. Although I have the same objectives as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, I disagree with him about the route by which we should achieve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend attach any significance to the fact that Sir John Nott, the chairman of Lazard Brothers and a former Cabinet Minister, and my right honourable and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon), who spoke in the debate on the City last week and is chairman of Britannia Arrow Securities, a large financial services company, believe that SIB should be a statutory body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that there is significant City opinion in favour of that view, but I am also aware that Sir Kenneth Berrill takes the opposite view and so I think that it is clear that the differences of opinion in the Committee also exist outside the Committee. Indeed, it would be surprising if that were not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is a substantial body of opinion in support of each side of the argument, but I would not like the record of our proceedings to show that the statement of Sir Kenneth Berrill's views went unchallenged. Anyone who has read Sir Kenneth's speech and is familiar with his view of the issue as a whole realises that the headlines that his speech attracted were misleading. I understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
that he remains of the view that he sees very little between one side of the argument and the other. His principal concern is that he should be given the freedom to get on with the job and given the necessary resources. If we could convince him that he had that freedom, I am sure that he would be glad to have statutory status to underpin his role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) says. Perhaps the headline overstated the case. Nevertheless, the balance of Sir Kenneth's opinion was that he preferred what was originally in the Bill before the amendment was accepted. No one can get away from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to say that we are not dealing with some narrow, ideological motivation but with a genuine, intellectual difference of opinion about the best method to proceed. I hope that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and other Opposition Members will give us credit for that genuine intellectual difference of opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. ButterfiU) by beginning with Sir Kenneth Berrill's speech. I have read that speech carefully and my interpretation of it coincides with that of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). My understanding is that Sir Kenneth said that he did not so much mind the distance that we have gone as a result of the amendments of the hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), but that we should not go much further down the line of statutory composition, rather than statutory recognition, which is what we have. The arguments between statutory composition and statutory recognition are now becoming rather fine. We may be arguing about something that is similar to the medieval argument about how many angels can stand on the point of a needle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we are coming together in defining what powers the SIB should have. There seems to be common agreement between both sides that the SIB requires statutory recognition and certain powers, of which the power to investigate and prosecute is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of Sir Kenneth Berrill's speech was that statutory constitution of the SIB would limit its freedom. We are calling for greater freedom for the SIB, which counters that argument. The freedom to investigate and to prosecute, is clearly what Sir Kenneth Berrill wanted, it is what Opposition Members want, and it is what the hon. Members for Chichester and for Beaconsfield are seeking in this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like there to be any misunderstanding. Conservative Members are not unanimous on that, and I am certainly not in favour of handing over the power of prosecution. I am convinced that we need to reserve that to the Secretary of State because he, as my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary said, is the only person who would be accountable in this place and that principle of accountability is extremely important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) does not agree that SIB should have the power to investigate, it is hardly surprising that he does not agree that it should have the power to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>895</span>
prosecute. My view is that if it is given one power, we would be well-advised to give it the other power as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of accountability was central to the Minister's argument. Like the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), I do not understand his argument. The amendment put forward by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) gives the power to the SIB or the Minister—and of course he can either delegate all of it or retain some of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 96 allows the delegation of all or any functions, and as I see it—I stand to be corrected—the fact that he hands over the power to investigate to the SIB does not in any way inhibit his power to investigate also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) is nodding, so he takes that point. Each of his amendments includes the notion of "and/or", so the Secretary of State retains the power to investigate if he so wishes, and he is accountable for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister shaking his head, and no doubt he will intervene, or make his point when he makes a speech. But if an investigation had not been carried out where it should have been, the Minister would be accountable to the House of Commons for not taking the action that the SIB had failed to take.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the Secretary of State be accountable for the misuse of the powers of investigation by the Securities and Investments Board, particularly as the amendment does not give the Secretary of State any discretion to revoke those powers? I should say "take away", rather that "revoke", because they would not be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that, because there are two types of accountability. One is the Secretary of State's accountability in respect of investigations that are not being carried on but ought to be; he has that power and can retain it. The other is in respect of the abuse of the investigative powers and, one would hope, in due course the prosecution powers too. Again I stand to be corrected by the Minister, but does he not have the power to revoke those? Clause 97 gives him the power to revoke all or any of those powers, just as he has delegated them in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with clause 97. The amendment to this clause would give those powers to the Securities and Investments Board. It is not a transfer; therefore there is no question of revocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister is saying, but each amendment refers to "or" the Securities and Investments Board. In other words, the Secretary of State has the capacity to delegate the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary is right, but it is a very technical point. The question that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) should put to him is whether he would accept our amendments if the Secretary of State had the power to call in the power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>896</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may want to address that point in his speech. I stand corrected: the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) tells me that that power is handed over willy nilly. My view is that it ought to be revocable. The Minister needs to address himself to the principle underlying the question of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. If that power were revocable under clause 97, would he then accept that principle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB should have the power to investigate and prosecute. If it is to be effective against the abuses that may occur after the big bang, it needs flexibility, speed of operation, and the capacity to operate on its own account. Sir Kenneth Berrill has said that he would wish to see that freedom of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an absolute desirability to get skilled people into the SIB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to bring in a note of urgency. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has gone, so we could have a quick vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the SIB is to attract the appropriate people, it is important that it has that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand the Minister's views on accountability and on the SIB's freedom of manoeuvre to tackle the problem more effectively than the Department of Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point on which we are all agreed is that a significant problem relating to insider dealings arises from the use of offshore vehicles. Has my hon. and learned Friend consulted the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary about the extradition powers that the Government intend to negotiate? Are the Government doing everything possible to empower investigators—whether employed by the designated agency or the Secretary of State—and prosecutors to bring back to this country suspected culprits of insider dealings or key witnesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Extradition is presently under consideration by the Government following the issue of last year's Green Paper. These matters will be taken into account. In the context of offshore insider trading, we attach importance to the exchange of information between regulators and to international regulatory cooperation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot respond positively to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) on information in relation to beneficial ownership of shareholdings, because nominee shareholdings can be used for legitimate reasons. The power for which he asked would go too wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If nominee shareholdings were used for legitimate purposes, the request would not be made. That power should be used only when such shareholdings are part of illegitimate dealings. If an insider trader were to read the proceedings of this morning's Committee, he would smile to himself, as he hid behind his Swiss bank account, at the heat generated in the past hour about the investigatory powers. I do not wish to denigrate the eloquent speeches in support of the amendments. However, the amendments will not make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>897</span>
a significant difference to the central problem of insider trading, which is a massive blot on the City and other financial centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the clause is an advance and I have some sympathy with the amendments. However, we shall still find, in the next five years, that the majority of investigations into insider trading run up against the fact that no one knows who was doing the deal. Until effective powers are taken to uncover beneficial ownership this problem will not go away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). I do not doubt that the Minister intends to deal with the problem, but I fear that our debate may be regarded as giving the green light to many people who had contemplated the use of nominee shareholdings and offshore companies, and who will say, "We now see the limitations of the powers in the Financial Services Bill and are confident that we cannot be compelled to reveal our beneficial ownership if we choose that route to get into insider dealing." If the Minister is serious, he must take that point on board and come back with a more effective provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that my arguments have not prevailed on my hon. and learned Friend the Minister, but I should like to make a few brief comments before putting the matter to a vote, as I think we should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially struck by the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). It is very worrying that the use of offshore vehicles may enable some insidious activities to go unnoticed, and whatever we include in the Bill may not make that possibility less likely. The amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) can only help us to move in that direction, but they cannot make it less likely that such situations will be uncovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend said, a person may have sanctions taken against him for refusal to disclose details, but how can we instigate that process unless investigators have reasonable suspicions to launch an inquiry? That possibility must be enhanced if SIB also has that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make three comments in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, under clause 96(5), the Secretary of State enjoys a range of investigative concurrent powers. Despite my hon. Friend's comments about his absence on the previous occasion, I shall look with interest to see whether he tables and moves amendments on Report to remove those concurrent powers; he is entitled to do so because those specific matters have not been covered in Committee. I suspect that the Government would resist such amendments and, indeed, I would resist them. Therefore, the problem of anachronism—of introducing that concurrent power—does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am seeking not a symbolic, but a deeply practical enhancement of investor protection. It is, of course, part of the panoply of showing that we mean business about investor protection, but we are talking about a real power to instigate investigations in the hands of SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>898</span>
Finally, many of the arguments about accountability are defective; specious is perhaps too strong a word. There is a range of public bodies with investigative powers of a fairly draconian nature—for example, the Housing Corporation, which has draconian powers of control and investigation into housing associations and fraudulent activities in them. The remit of the Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales includes uncovering fraud in local government, and it has powers of investigation. As a statutory body, SIB should also enjoy those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend challenged me on a point. The functions in clause 96(5) are exercisable concurrently; that is not my point. My hon. Friend's amendment proposes that they would be an alternative, which would create much confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the sole sticking point on the acceptability of my amendment, I should be happy to concede it, but I suspect that it does not go to the root of my hon. Friend's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed with the response. The investing public will expect us to put the matter to a vote so that we can see those who are anxious to ensure that the new regulatory framework will give SIB those powers. It is a modest, but practical and reasonable extension of those that it already enjoys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly—for no more than five minutes—to express my extreme disappointment with the Minister's reply. He has caused me to fluctuate between extreme disappointment and mild disappointment. The brilliant tuition of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who has been running the tutorial, has not been as effective as I hoped it would be in persuading a somewhat recalcitrant pupil to accept the wisdom of our arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply appeared to ignore the main point; he is still thinking in the context of the SIB as he would like it to be. The SIB has been effectively killed by the Committee. The nostalgia that is so evocative of the Conservative party but is so wrong in this context means that the Minister cannot help living in the past. When I asked whether he would accept the extension of the SIB's powers if he accepted the SIB as it will be, his reply was incomprehensible. It dodged the main issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that ground we should support the amendment when we vote on it next Tuesday because the Minister has not put forward a convincing argument. He has said that it is a horrendous problem and a blot on the escutcheon—I supply that word free of charge—of the stock exchange and of the whole capitalist system. He backs a group of people who are using their insider knowledge to make themselves a quick buck against the ethos of building and production, which is so important to encourage, and says, "Yes, we know things are bad, but let's carry on in the same old way, giving the power to the same old people, and running things much as they are." That is unsatisfactory and fails to recognise the now central—and changed—role of the SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are anxious to join the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). [Interruption.] I do not know

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>899</span>
whether that interruption is an attempt at persuasion, but it is certainly interrupting the logical sequence of my brief speech. Pressure should not be brought publicly in that fashion. However, as it is being brought, I can only continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister fails to recognise the changed role of the SIB which is central and must have powers. Let us put the responsibility for dealing with this serious problem that we all admit precludes the development of the people's capitalism that we are here to encourage and is an affront to small shareholders right where it belongs—with the SIB. Shareholders have little influence on the companies in which they invest anyway and when they see people making a killing at their expense that is a further affront. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I thought that I heard the name of Geoffrey Dickens mentioned. I thought that I would name Geoffrey Dickens in this context.
