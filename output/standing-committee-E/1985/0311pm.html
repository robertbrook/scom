	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is the appropriate point at which to comment on the Minister's reply, which I assume he has finished, to my interesting and important amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister warmed up as he went along. I hope that in future he will warm up before he gets up to speak and that he will get up with a more generous spirit. The precondition for having power, or even the essential attribute of power, is magnanimity of spirit—an acceptance of intelligent arguments well put and a realisation that they may be correct. That should be a precondition for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's getting on as a Minister, although, in view of the Government of which he is a member, I should withdraw that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister confirm that he said that he was minded to have a significant proportion of lay members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>742</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to confirm that I said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, what does the Minister mean by "significant"? Does he mean substantial?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may ask, but I choose not to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a great shame, because, in the midst of the emerging spirit of good will, the Minister has put his foot in it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Minister's statement that he was inclined to have a significant proportion of lay members had to be wheedled, wittered, worrited and winkled out of him. He did not offer it in a spirit of magnanimity in response to the arguments that were put so tellingly from his own side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it helps the hon. Member to sit down, I assure him that I do not intend to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to the courage and integrity of Government Members, but the hon. Gentleman's remark has brought me to them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting division is emerging in the Committee. It seems that the measure will become the Chichester charter, or Nelson's law, although I hope that it will not end in a touching picture like the one in the Royal gallery in the House of Lords, in which Nelson is shown lying on the deck, dying, and the crowd clusters forward to hear his last words, which are reputed to be "Kiss me, Hardy". I hope that after all this they will not be "Kiss me, Howard". I have to recognise political realities. I want it set down in black and white that the amendments are important, as they would specify what the proportion of lay members should be and that the chairman should be an independent member of the operation; but, however important the amendments are, they will be accepted only with support from Government Members. Some support has been forthcoming—even though Conservative Members are not minded to vote for the amendment, they have expressed their wish that there should be a proportion of lay members on the regulatory body to represent the public interest. The Minister must be pushed in the sensible direction towards which he moved in the closing sentence of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the light of political realities on the Conservative side and the Minister's statement that he is inclined to have a significant proportion of lay members, it would be sensible to withdraw the amendment and not to proceed to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shoreditch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Would you, Sir John, help the Committee with a problem that has arisen out of our proceedings last Thursday and this morning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>743</span>
The Committee has said that the designated agency should be SIB—the Securities and Investments Board—and some of us want to put down amendments that would simply delete "designated agency" where it appears in the Bill and insert the words "Securities and Investment Board. We have consulted the Clerk, who told us that the amendment that we have already carried has had that effect, and everywhere that we see "designated agency" we should now see "SIB". I find that difficult to believe. Ministers and Conservative Members have constantly referred to a "designated agency"—not SIB—in their speeches. Would you, Sir John, rule on whether we can put down an amendment to delete "designated agency" and put in "Securities and Investment Board" so that we can make the Minister and Conservative Members talk about what is actually in the Bill and not what they may wish to see in it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is open to any hon. Member to put down any amendment. Whether the Chair, in its wisdom, decides to select amendments is a matter of trial and error. I could not possibly rule on a hypothetical verbal amendment. I hear what the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) says, and the Clerk—who has been in attendance throughout most of the Committee's proceedings—is also aware of the point. My brother Chairman will no doubt select, or not, as he sees fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same point of order. It may be helpful if I explain to the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) that, following the consequential amendment that was passed after the main amendment last Thursday, any reference in the Bill to a "designated agency" actually means "the Securities and Investments Board". Therefore, no problem arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I am not asking for a statement about whether we can put down hypothetical amendments; I am asking what is actually in the Bill. If it went through without the Minister putting down any changes on Report, would we see the words "designated agency" or the words "Securities and Investments Board" when it was published? That may seem to be an arcane point, but it is not. It is critical to the concept of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the duty of the Chair to interpret the Bill—that is for highly paid lawyers to do. I have already ruled that it is open to any hon. Member to put down amendments. Whether they are selected remains to be seen. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), who has given the Committee his advice, makes it clear to me—as he must have done to other hon. Members—that no amendment is needed to incorporate the interpretation of the words that are causing anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am not asking you to rule on an interpretation of the Bill, Sir John. I am asking—and perhaps you need time for consultation and consideration before you answer—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>744</span>
what words will go in the Bill when it reaches the stage at which it is printed to go to the House of Lords. That is not a point of interpretation. Something has to be printed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly simply. The Bill will be printed as passed in Committee, and on Report. It will receive Royal Assent as it is printed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Sir John. It will not have escaped your attention that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) made the bizarre suggestion that I should draw upon the historic victory of my namesake and kiss my hon. and learned Friend. That is a serious point because, since this morning's sitting, we have received the 	<i>Official Report</i> of last Thursday's sitting. I wish to draw to your attention to an error in column 526, when I was referring to my hon. and learned Friend, but the report refers to
	<br><q><p>"my hon Friend and Lady Friend the Under-Secretary".—	<i>[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee E,</i> 6 March 1986; c.526.]</p></q>
May I make it clear, Sir John, that my hon. and learned Friend and I are just good friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This sitting is becoming far too enjoyable, and we should proceed to amendment No. 192, but let me assure the hon. Gentleman and the Minister that matters will be put right in the ultimate, bound edition of 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 141, line 14, at end insert
	<br><q><p>'provided that the agency is satisfied that the functions are performed in a manner equivalent to that performed by the agency itself under sub-paragraph (1) above'.</p></q>
This amendment deals with the problem of equivalence of enforcement of rules. Although there is a requirement for equivalence of rules between SROs, there is anxiety, especially among some putative SROs, that there will not be equivalence of enforcement. That is feared principally by the Stock Exchange, which, over the years, has developed an admirable system of enforcement of its rules and thinks that new SROs may not have such sophisticated procedures for enforcement. You, Sir John, will appreciate that, if the SROs are to be on all fours with one another, it is important that they enforce their rules in a similar and equivalent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment seeks, therefore, to impose the duty that there should be equivalence of enforcement, and, as such, it is purely a technical amendment, on which I am interested to hear the views of my hon and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given much thought to my hon. Friend's point. The requirements for enforcement by SROs are in schedule 2, paragraph 4(1) of which provides that an SRO
	<br><q><p>"must have adequate arrangements and resources for the effective monitoring and enforcement of compliance with its rules".</p></q>
That provision provides an adequate safeguard for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>745</span>
effective enforcement. However, it does not meet the specific and additional point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), that more than effective enforcement should be required but that a degree of equivalence should be imported into enforcement of its rules by an SRO. Presumably, in common with the equivalence of the rules, it would need to be equivalence with the enforcement secured by the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to give my hon. Friend's point the serious consideration that it merits, with a view to the possibility of an amendment to schedule 2 to introduce a requirement of equivalence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of my hon. and learned Friend's comprehensive and helpful reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 141, line 27, after 'dealing', insert 'and competence'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This goes back to a point that I have made repeatedly throughout our proceedings that it is essential to ensure that those running the SROs and those who are striving through the SIB or the designated agency will maintain a level of competence as well as
	<br><q><p>"high standards of integrity and fair dealing".</p></q>
Schedule 5 mirrors provisions along those lines in other parts of the Bill, and I hope that the note that I had on the question of "fit and proper" persons applies to the requirements to be imposed on the agency so that a high level of competence would also be included in the maintenance of standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Minister to make his observations on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle underlying the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) is the precisely the same as that behind other amendments that he has tabled. I sought to allay my hon. Friend's fears on the implications of the term "fit and proper", as it appeared earlier in the Bill, by circulating a note that provided a definition of that term. The thinking behind my note and my response to my hon. Friend's earlier amendment applies to amendment No. 156.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of my hon. and learned Friend's observation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 141, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(2) The agency shall have a duty to act fairly as between those persons regulated by it.'.</p></q>
The amendment is on a point that I hope will not detain the Committee for long, although it may be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>746</span>
significant. The Minister may be able to assure me that the matter is adequately dealt with elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is animated by the belief that the SIB will have a difficult task. There is the problem of its uncertain status, as a result of the amendment passed at our previous sitting, and the question of the extent of its powers. But, more particularly, it will have to deal with, regulate and supervise a disparate group of regulators. On the one hand it will have a body such as the Stock Exchange, which has a long record of experience and expertise, and on the other hand it will have to deal with several self-regulating organisations that have yet to be put in place and whose competence is in question. Furthermore, there will be many individual people or institutions seeking direct authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task of the SIB in trying to deal satisfactorily with all those groups will be difficult enough, but it may be eased if they are assured that the SIB is obliged to deal fairly between them: In the absence of a provision such as the amendment suggests there may be a danger that SROs or individuals may fear that they are being penalised by the SIB. They may fear that too much weight is being given to the Stock Exchange or, conversely, because of the pre-eminent position of the Stock Exchange, that too much effort is being made to accommodate the interests of other SROs. But in either case it would gravely weaken the authority of the Securities and Investments Board, and thereby gravely prejudice its chances of success, if there were thought to be any chance of anything other than impartial treatment between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An amendment that would impose directly in specific terms on the SIB a duty to act fairly may well allay potential fears that otherwise might stand in the way of effective regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree that the designated agency should act fairly between the persons that it regulates. But I do not think that the amendment is necessary to achieve that. The agency will be exercising statutory powers and will have to do so subject to the usual restraints, including the restraint that it must not act unreasonably. If an action by an agency were to be actuated by other than relevant considerations, that would not be a reasonable use of the powers, and it could be challenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I were to spell out the various safeguards against unfair use of the agency's powers. First, there is the availability of judicial review against an unreasonable action on the agency's part. Secondly, any decision of the agency of importance to individuals or particular businesses would be referable to the tribunal. The tribunal would not consider whether the agency was reasonable in taking or proposing to take the decision: it would consider the case afresh and come to its own conclusion on the correct decision. Any unfairness on the part of the agency could be overturned in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there are the competition provisions. If the agency took action which treated one class of persons unfairly, without adequate justification on investor protection grounds, that could constitute an anticompetitive practice, and the Secretary of State could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>747</span>
resume transferred functions or direct the agency to take steps to change its rules or practices. Finally, the agency's immunity from liability for damages extends only to things done or omitted in good faith. Any unfairness on the part of the agency which constituted bad faith would still be actionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied that the Minister wishes to achieve the same objective as I seek in moving the amendment. I am not always satisfied that ex post facto remedies through the courts or the tribunal are exactly what we want. There may still be a persuasive case for including in the rules—which can be read in advance—the sort of duty that is embodied in the amendment. However, I am not supposed to press the matter to a vote, and in the light of the Minister's comments I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> that this schedule be the fifth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The title of schedule 5 is "Qualifications of Designated Agency". The schedule is now inadequate because of the two amendments which have been made to clause 96. The schedule should be replaced by one that recognises the change that has been made. I have therefore tabled a new schedule. Although we cannot debate it today, I am entitled to refer to it because I am arguing that we should leave out schedule 5 to the Bill and replace it with one along the lines of my proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no claims for the perfection of the new schedule, and it will be open to amendment by Committee members. However, I believe that it is more comprehensive and more appropriate to the Bill. My proposed schedule incorporates many of the provisions contained in schedules 5 and 7 and deals with several other important matters as well.

Let me deal first with the question of staff. At our last sitting, when my hon. Friend the Minister argued against the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), he relied heavily on the argument that if the SIB was to become a statutory body there would be difficulty in recruiting staff of the right calibre and at the appropriate salaries. I pointed out that there were satisfactory precedents, such as the Audit Commission for local authorities set up by the present Government under the Local Government Finance Act 1982. I have since looked at that Act and have used a number of suitably amended provisions from schedule 3 to the Act, one of which deals with staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 of my new schedule deals with the question of staff. In particular, subparagraph 3 makes it clear that
	<br><q><p>"The Board's officers and servants … shall be appointed at such remuneration and on such other terms and conditions as the Board may determine."</p></q>
I agree with my hon. and learned Friend that that is a very important matter. Yesterday I called Mr. John Banham, the controller of audit at the Audit Commission, who was appointed by the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>748</span>
State for the Environment, to confirm that I had got this right. I am not sure that the Governor of the Bank of England was involved in that appointment, because I believe that with most bodies created by statute the appointments are left to the Secretary of State. This is an innovation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that the new schedule refers to
	<br><q><p>"members appointed by the Secretary of State and the Governor of the Bank of England acting jointly".</p></q>
I noticed that at least one hon. Member who voted with my hon. Friend on an earlier amendment has subscribed his name to this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made the point that my schedule is not perfect in every respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In point of fact, the issue is out of order. We should be discussing schedule 5, with peripheral remarks about the suggested new schedule, instead of plunging into too great detail about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, for I was diverted by my hon. Friend. It would be out of order to discuss my new schedule in detail, but it will be open to Committee Members to table amendments to it. My new schedule recognises the real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of amendments tabled at our previous sitting, clause 96 contains a reference to the Securities and Investments Board, which is the only body to which the Secretary of State can delegate his powers under the Bill. He can decide that the Department of Trade and Industry will regulate authorised investment businesses directly, or he can delegate those powers to the SIB, the choice put forward by Professor Gower in his report. That is reasonable. Having made that change, we must consider the ramifications and implications in more detail. We should leave out schedule 5, so that we can introduce my new schedule into the Bill, amended as the Committee sees fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to endorse what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said about the inadequacy and inappropriateness of schedule 5. I am interested in his new schedule. Although I agree that it is not perfect and we may table some amendments to it, we expect to support its general objectives. We would be happy to support the hon. Gentleman if he proposes to vote against schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the powers, composition, functions and so on of the SIB—we must now refer not to the designated agency but to the SIB—the Government could learn from a leading article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> about 10 days or a fortnight ago. The Minister will no doubt have read it and will remember it. It said that, because the Bill had a private body at its heart, much of the attention and effort of the Committee and of others interested in the Bill had been devoted towards beefing up the designated agency and trying to bring it more closely to being a statutory commission. It went on to say that it might have been better if the Government had started with the obvious and logical starting point—that a statutory system should be run by a statutory body. They could then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>749</span>
have concentrated on ensuring that the statutory commission had the right balance of powers, and a substantial element of self-regulation and so on, and we could have spent our time more constructively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened at our previous sitting gives the government another chance to follow that excellent advice. I am sure that the Committee is now more than willing to help the Government in introducing that change of direction and emphasis in the Bill. I should like to help or encourage the Minister in that direction by reminding him that we were constrained to vote against Second Reading on a reasoned amendment, largely because of the absence of a statutory commission to administer the structure provided in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still many provisions in the Bill that we regard as being deficient. For example, as the Minister knows, I argue that Lloyd's should have been brought within its scope. We lost that argument, and I suspect that it is unlikely that we shall win it at any stage during the Bill's passage. I regret that. We shall continue to argue the case but I accept that we probably shall not win it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, if we persuaded the Government, with the help of the Committee, to work constructively for an effective statutory body with the proper definitions, identity and range of powers, although I can give no assurance as we do not know the final form of the Bill, it would at least enter the realm of possibility that we might say on Third Reading that the Bill was more or less in the shape that we wished. I emphasise that I am not giving that undertaking, but it would become a real possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people may dismiss that suggestion as a matter of technical inter-party dealings, but I suspect that it would have a wider significance. It would mean that, for all those in the City who are trying to determine how their affairs are to be regulated—not for the next year or two but for the next half decade or decade—a much greater element of certainty and stability would thereby have been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if the Bill goes forward, having been contested by the official Opposition and other Opposition parties throughout all its stages, so that it is a partisan piece of legislation, the Opposition would be compelled to say that, on our return to Government, we would have to legislate again to remedy the obvious deficiencies of the Bill as we saw them. We would be compelled to say that we had argued for 10 years or more for a statutory commission, and that is what we should have to put in place as soon as we had the legislative opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister could work with us to put in place a proper statutory body instead of the unfortunate compromise with which his predecessors lumbered him, the real possibility opens up—I put it no stronger—that the Bill could be passed with substantial all-party support. I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), but he may be prepared to associate himself with this general approach. The Bill would then go forward to be tested
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>750</span>
in practical terms as to whether it was an effective instrument, but there would be no necessity to commit ourselves to legislate differently at the first opportunity. We could say, as one would say of any other piece of legislation, "Let us see how it works in practice." If it turned out to have deficiencies in practice, clearly any Government, of whatever persuasion, would have to deal with them. We are not saying that in no circumstances would we legislate again on these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to respond immediately, but it may help him to consider the best and most constructive approach and response to what the Committee is clearly saying if he bears in mind that possibility. If that helps him, it will help the Committee and all those who wish to see an effective regulation in the City.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am inclined to vote against the inclusion of schedule 5. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), I feel regretfully, in the absence of an open-mindedness on the part of my hon. and learned Friend the Minister at least to leaving open the matter of statutory recognition for the SIB, that it is important to build on the amendment that the Committee, in its wisdom, has passed and to entrench the position so that, on Report, the House will have a clear, fully reasoned and instituted piece of legislation to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend made the honest and sincere statement that I expected from him, and he is convinced of the reasons that led him to express that view. But I regret as a matter of tactics that—given the clear expressions of support which my hon. Friends have given me since the passage of the amendment last week, and the commitment which a number of them have given me to speak in favour of and vote for the retention of the measure—it would have been wise at least to have left open that possibility rather than seek to close the door on it. In that event, my hon. and learned Friend must appreciate that we, too, holding a sincere but slightly different point of view, wish to ensure that a proper framework—which, as I understand it, is included in the new schedule with which we shall deal later—is built upon the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling an amendment or a schedule to a Bill, politics is the art of the possible, and in drafting that new schedule I had to decide whether this morning's amendment regarding the chairman would be passed. I concluded that, despite my support for it, it probably would not be passed and that a schedule containing largely the phrases included in schedule 5 about the appointment of the chairman was more likely to commend itself to both sides of the Committee and, therefore, should be included. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, it is open to any hon. Member, including myself, to table an amendment to that new schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This piece of legislation has been like a game of pass the parcel, with the parcel being handed on from successive Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State, and I fear that whoever eventually opens it may receive a shock instead of a surprise. Those hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>751</span>
Members who have tried to follow matters from the beginning have a commitment. I include all Conservative Members in that, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. That commitment is nothing new. Everything for which I have argued is contained in my Second Reading speech. The Government, the Patronage Secretary and everyone else knew my views on the matter, which I have expressed many times, and I am maintaining integrity with those statements in expressing my views this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my current intention to vote against the schedule, for reasons of tidiness but also to concentrate the attention of the Committee and the Government on the need for a replacement to schedule 5, along the lines of the more detailed and specific one to which we shall come later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The schedule sets out what an agency must do to qualify. I want to say a few words to assist my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who made what the City will see as an illuminating series of comments about the Labour party's position in respect of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak for all my hon. Friends, but I speak in the knowledge that my comments are supported, in the main part, by many hon. Friends who are not serving on this Committee. When I first came to the Committee, I made it clear that I was seeking objective debates and conclusions. In his contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham drew atteniton to the position of Labour Members. I do not want the next Labour Government—if there is to be one, and I do not say that in a contentious way—to have to legislate in this sphere. We must resolve the problems in Committee. Not only my hon. Friends but many Conservative Members and even some people in the City believe that the designated agency should have a statutory basis. Knowing that the Labour party may be satisfied with the Bill, the City institutions should at least compromise on that front. They fear Labour Governments—not for the reasons that they should fear us—and they may believe that a Labour Government will introduce legislation that further interferes with their rights. If that threat were removed by having a statutorily based agency, they should vigorously support such a principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should also take that point into account. When a Labour Government introduce legislation they are aware that it can be amended by future Governments. I understood that the aim of Committees was to establish a consensus to avoid further legislation covering the same areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to proceed on the basis that every time a Government were elected they should automatically repeal former legislation, there would be legislative congestion and the Government would be in total confusion. We cannot operate on that basis. Obviously, the Finance Bill is different because it involves the distribution of the cake. However, we should try to establish a consensus. I believe that we have the basis of a consensus which will remove the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>752</span>
need for an incoming Government of another political persuasion to legislate in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a Labour Government or a Government of another political persuasion were elected, they would not introduce a Bill exclusively for this area. A Pandora's box of additional issues would be opened. Those issues would be debated outside the House, in trade unions, in the City and in committees, and they would invariably be included in new legislation. That could be avoided.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) may wish to go further, but we all have to compromise sometimes. This is a major compromise which even my hon. Friend would wish to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can see my point of view, because many problems in the future could be avoided. I hope that people and institutions in the City recognise that there is a will to make the Bill a once-for-all measure. If the Government insist on reversing the change made last week, on their own heads be it, because we do not know what will happen in different circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who referred to Pandora's box. I am worried about the state of play on schedule 5, because it is like an Augean stable. It will not help to list all the ways in which the amendment passed last week on clause 96 does not achieve its objectives or fit in with the Bill's structure. The amendment does not make sense when related to other matters. For example, clause 97 (3) refers to schedule 5. The hon. Members who tabled the amendment, or, rather, agreed to it—which is a different matter, and I am sure that hon. Members will appreciate the irony—have not done the comprehensive job that was needed to achieve their objectives. They have left us with what can only be described as a dog's dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying "We do not accept last week's amendment although it was passed by the Committee." In that case, it is the Minister's responsibility to develop the Bill to conform to the requirements of the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman does not accept that, he is arguing for two separate Committees—his little Committee which can go ahead with the Minister and return the Bill to its original form, and the rest, the majority, of the Committee which can continue to reshape the Bill in the way that we wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to speak for everyone in the room, but I am not sure that he is right. The problem is that clause 96 is dependent upon the Secretary of State's discretion. In addition, the new provision that has been included—I concede that—must be dependent on clause 96(1)(6), which states that
	<br><q><p>"the requirements of Schedule 5 to this Act are satisfied in the case of that body".</p></q>
That is conjunctive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give other examples, but I shall not do so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>753</span>
because the situation is transparently obvious. However, Opposition Members and some of my hon. Friends are arguing that we must redraft the Bill to take account of one amendment which we have passed but which does not even have an interpretation provision—although I concede that the words "a designated agency" have been changed to "the designated agency".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repudiate the points made by Opposition Members. There is a case for a serious rethink before Report on whether it should be "the SIB" or "a designated agency". The Minister has said that he intends to introduce an amendment on Report. However, we could spend a lot of time arguing about the bits and pieces associated with the amendment passed last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can help the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) because we share a common objective, which is not to spend too much time redrafting as we go. I should be happy if the Minister took up the hon. Gentleman's suggestion and reexamined the matter. The one way to ensure that it will be re-examined is to say that schedule 5 is no longer appropriate—as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree—and should not be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a schedule "stand part" debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is right in saying that we cannot now discuss what the new schedule involves. It would be better to wait until we reach the new clause, because only then will the relevance of what my hon. Friend has to say be put to the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Unless schedule 5 is left out of the Bill it will not be possible to debate my new schedule. I should be grateful if you could confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I had in mind when I made the suggestion. We are moving into difficult territory, so in the interests of the Committee we should come to a conclusion. I recommend that we allow schedule 5 to go forward and then consider whether we deal with other matters as they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak on schedule 5, but I was amazed by the speech of the hon. Member for Stafford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flabbergasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was flabbergasted, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) suggests. He is a better wordsmith than I, and he feeds me with words as I go along. However, the speech was incredible. The hon. Member for Stafford said in a condemnatory way that the Committee had put the Government into a difficult position. But he was not in Committee when we voted on the critical amendment last week. When I stumbled out into the Corridor, I bumped into the hon. Member for Stafford. Had he been present in Committee he could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>754</span>
have saved the Government, or, as we would put it, while we were working hard he could have been here helping us out. He must tell us how he would have voted had he been in Committee. I know that that is a hypothetical question, but as he has accused the Committee of putting the Government into a jam, he must tell us whether he would have supported the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. It is important that we give the hon. Member for Stafford the opportunity to do what he did last week—to go away so that he will not have to show any courage or independence or make his mind up—, and to come back next week to condemn us for the decision taken in his absence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take the Committee off the subject. I suspect that, in his heart of hearts, the hon. Member for Stafford is a radical and a rebel and had he been here he would have voted with us and against the Government. He has been nobbled, but was it for political advantage—, pecuniary advantage, or has he been threatened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say with confidence that it has nothing to do with any of those three things, nor is the matter a dark and sinister one such as the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch specialises in. I sometimes feel that he might be better known as the hon. Member for Sludgemore. However, in suggesting that I disclose what I would have done had I been in Committee, the hon. Gentleman is asking a hypothetical question that I will not answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's sensibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The message given to me—and it is quite reasonable—is that the hon. Member for Stafford was not well on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I believe that stumbling about the building blindfolded from one room to another is a sure sign tha the hon. Member for Stafford was not well when we took the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only reason for rising is simply to say that this is an occasion when we should put the national interest before partisan ideology. In that event I hope that we shall carry the hon. Gentleman with us; that all will be forgiven; that it will be sweetness and light; and "Kiss Me…" whoever it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be relatively brief because the arguments that have a bearing on the fate of the schedule have been canvassed at length in the Committee over last week and this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate by hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on his ingenuity in drafting his new schedule, to which I intend to refer only in the most peripheral fashion. Subject to that comment, I understand that the new schedule would have the effect of ensuring that the statutory commission would reproduce as far as possible the characteristics of the private sector agency, which was at the heart of the original concept of the Bill. It is possible to do anything
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>755</span>
and everything by statute, and with great ingenuity my hon. Friend has achieved that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your leave, Sir John, I shall confine myself to one or two peripheral comments on the new schedule, which may help the thinking of the Committee and of my hon. Friend as he ponders the matter after the debate. Paragraph 4 of the new schedule deals with the tenure of office of members. In four specified circumstances subparagraph (3) empowers the Secretary of State to remove a member from office of the agency that he proposes to set up. I should like the Committee to reflect on that for a moment as it points to problems that could arise if we make the change that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield wishes to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the change to clause 96 is that the Secretary of State is constrained in the way in which he can transfer his powers: he can transfer them only to the Securities and Investments Board. But paragraph 4(3) of the new schedule would withdraw the general power to terminate the appointment of members who serve on the agency, which is part of the existing schedule 5, and substitute the much narrower set of circumstances in which the termination of the appointment of members can take place. So that additional element of accountability disappears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall shortly reach clause 97, which my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) seeks to amend to remove the power that the Secretary of State would have to revoke powers that he has transferred to the designated agency. The net effect of those three suggested changes would be that the Secretary of State could transfer his powers only to the Securities and Investments Board; that having transferred them he could not recall them; and that when they were in the hands of the board he could not terminate the appointment of members of the board, save in the specified circumstances set out in paragraph 4 of the new schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is only an example, but I commend it to the Committee and to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield when he considers the implications of the changes that he has urged upon the Committee. It is an example of the way in which the changes would, as I suggested this morning, substantially reduce the accountability of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I sense that the Minister is arguing his case by making an attack on a new schedule instead of dealing with schedule 5. The Minister is on the defensive because he has to plead the case for retaining the schedule. His argument relates to a debate that may take place later if schedule 5 is removed. Will you, Mr. Shaw, keep the Minister in order? I intend no disrespect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was listening as attentively as possible for a stranger to the Committee. I was under the impression that the Minister's remarks were perfectly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>756</span>
longer with this argument, but I commend it to the Committee as an example of the way in which the accountability of the agency which would be substituted for the agency in the Bill, would be substantially reduced and would weaken the whole system of investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has selected some powers of the Audit Commission, which he has used as a model for his new schedule, and has omitted other conditions on the commission. For example, the Secretary of State has power to substitute his own scale of fees for the fees proposed by the commission. He can veto external borrowing of the commission even within the statutory limit and give the commission general directions about the discharge of its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that way the Audit Commission is made accountable under the statute from which it derives its authority. My hon. Friend has removed the way in which the commission is made accountable but has not substituted any way of making his proposed board or agency accountable. That omission lies at the heart of the difficulties which, I suggest, are a consequence of the amendment made last week and which would be caused by omitting schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to retain schedule 5 in its present form, to retain for the Secretary of State and the Governor of the Bank of England the power to remove members of the board of the designated agency and to retain the other powers in schedule 5. Those powers will provide the best safeguard for the system of investor protection that the Bill seeks to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made much of apparent differences between the basis of accountability if schedule 5 and clause 96 in its original form remained in the Bill, and the basis of accountability that might apply under the new schedule tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it remains open to the Committee to debate those matters at much greater length and there is still the possibility that amendments may be tabled to the new schedule. However, I am not persuaded that there may be such differences or that I am especially concerned about them. One reason for changing the basis of the SIB from a private company to a statutory body is to change the nature of the accountability that may have to be written into the Bill. I am not worried by the Minister's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed—I put it no higher—that the Minister did not respond to my general remarks, which were effectively endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), about the approach of the Opposition to the general question if we could obtain from the Minister's assurance that we would work together here. I record my disappointment on that score because I suspect that we have condemned the Committee, the House and perhaps the City to an unnecessary period of uncertainty as a consequence of the Minister's refusal to consider that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remove schedule 5 because if we do not we shall not have the opportunity to consider the new schedule. Surely all hon. Members, even those who would not support our aims and those of some of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>757</span>
their hon. Friends in every respect, would not wish debate on this important matter to be stifled in this way.

Given that no one would argue that schedule 5 is appropriate any longer, that in one way or another it has to go—bearing in mind the changes the Committee has made—we lose very little by removing it. We would be opening up a proper debate on the new schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Given that schedule 5 is no longer appropriate", but he does not give any reasons for saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to give those reasons. Schedule 5 sets out the conditions on which a body would have to qualify if it sought to become a designated agency. Its aim is to provide answers for some contenders who may ask what they will have to do to qualify as the designated agency, but that question can no longer be asked. There is only one body which can become the designated agency—the Securities and Investments Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we fail to remove schedule 5, we lumber the Bill with an inappropriate provision and prevent a proper debate on the important matter covered by the new schedule. I hope that hon. Members will think carefully before they allow the schedule to remain, thereby precluding any further debate on this important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Minister made a clever speech, but all it illustrated was the power of the Civil Service machine. I tabled my new schedule at three o'clock yesterday afternoon. By seven o'clock it was in the Minster's office in manuscript form. No doubt an army of civil servants stayed up all night picking holes in it. I made it clear that I did not regard my new schedule as anything like perfect, and my hon. and learned Friend spent most of his speech taking it apart. I am happy for amendments to be tabled, and I hope that he will table amendments to my new schedule when we reach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one final plea to my hon. and learned Friend. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and I feel strongly about this matter. We have an opportunity here to make progress. I shall give four reasons for supporting our proposals in ascending order of priority. First, there is a strong feeling in the City of London that a statutory commission is inevitable in due course. If it is, we should bite the bullet and include it in the Bill now, rather than having to legislate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, look what happened to the Lloyd's Act 1982. At the time it was criticised for going too far. Surely no one believes now that it goes too far, and everyone believes that it now needs strengthening. Surely that will be the result of the Neill inquiry. Surely there should be more external members of the council. It will be the same with the Bill. We see the big bang coming in October, and the arrival of people who have no experience of the ways and traditions of the City of London, such as Nomura Securities, Merrill Lynch and so on. I am not criticising them, but saying that they are newcomers to the City of London. For that reason we must have the strongest possible regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>758</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third reason is that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester and I have spoken to several of our hon. Friends, most of those who take an interest in these matters, and almost all of them support the change that we made last week. They have said so on previous occasions. There is a lot of support for our amendment, although we know that the majority will go through the Lobby and push the proposal out, if that is what my hon. and learned Friend wants. However, those who understand these matters support our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the most attractive proposition of all, surely, was that of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)—the prospect of all-party support for the Bill and of no Division on Third Reading. Surely, that is a prize worth taking now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly add my words to those of the hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), for one reason. The Minister now has the opportunity—that is what all this discussion boils down to—to accept a proposal that clearly has considerable cross-party support, not least on his own Back Benches. In his own terms, that is giving away very little indeed—only recognition that the term "SIB" should appear. It gives away nothing of substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I left the Committee at the end of our previous sitting, there was bewilderment among certain highly-placed members of the public who occasionally listen to our proceedings. They could not understand what the fuss was about. The Minister had the opportunity to give way to the least extent possible. If he did not do that, they said, there would be attempts, at least, to change the legislation later to make it much more onerous, in a direction which I perhaps could not approve, though I understand that certain members of the Labour party would wish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has the opportunity now to concede a point that not only has he been pressed to concede, but which it is to his advantage to concede. If he does that, it will create the minimum disruption to the Bill in the long term. I cannot see why he has drawn a line on which to fight a battle over a matter that is of minor symbolic importance now, but which might have significant long-term consequences in the more distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has made a strong case for the new schedule from his own point of view, but the emphasis that has been placed on whether or not the SIB should be a statutory body seems to me somewhat misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned Lloyd's. Lloyd's itself is a statutory body, incorporated by private Act of Parliament. My hon. Friend's point that Lloyd's had difficulties could apply just as well to any other body that was incorporated by Act of Parliament. It could also be made about the fact that, if a statutory instrument were made by the Minister under the powers conferred by the Bill, all the statutory functions would be attracted to the body which had been given the transferred functions so that it would to all intents and purposes be-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>759</span>
come a statutory body anyway, to which judicial review and so on would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although I listened with great interest and care to what both my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield have said, and the plea that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has made, I feel that we have before us something of an Augean stable and that, in the circumstances, it would be better to stand fast by schedule 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly reply to one of the points made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)? He will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that he said that schedule 5 as it stands had now no place and was no longer appropriate or necessary in the light of the changes made to clause 96. However, even in its amended form, clause 96 requires the SIB to meet the requirements set out in schedule 5 before the Secretary of State can transfer his powers to that board. There is therefore still a clear need for schedule 5 and for the requirements that it contains. Indeed, it is a prerequisite of clause 96 as amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. I am happy to agree with him, because something has to do the job of schedule 5. All I am arguing is that schedule 5 was drafted on one basis, which has now substantially changed. I think that the Minister would concede that if clause 96 had been drafted at the outset as it has now been amended, schedule 5 would have taken a different form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will concede that we should have the opportunity of deciding or debating what that different form should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO DESIGNATED AGENCY'S RULES AND REGULATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 257, in page 142, line 11, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'4A. The conduct of business rules must make proper provision for requiring an authorised person to impose restrictions on dealings in investments carried out by or on behalf of employees of the authorised person, in which those employees have a beneficial interest.'.</p></q>
The purpose of the amendment is to stress the vital importance of establishing adequate control over the activity of employees of authorised persons. Employees with responsibility for managing and dealing in large sums on behalf of investment clients have immense scope for abuse. The biggest blot on the Stock Exchange's own regulatory record in recent years is the Halliday Simpson case. That case illustrates the kind of abuse that worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most common abuse is based on the late booking of bargains. After it has been established whether an order has been transacted at the price that will generate a quick profit, it will be decided to whose account that profit will be allocated. That practice makes the Lloyd's operation of baby syndicates look moral and complicated to arrange. It is a straightforward transfer of profits from one account to another and it is impossible to say whether it is widespread. Someone asked, "How many men cheat on their wives?", and I have heard in some circles that it is widespread. Let us hope that that is not the case for this practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the rules can prevent this practice, whether it is widespread or not, they would be a valuable and important part of the system of investor protection in the Bill. I am not convinced that the draft rules from the SIB are adequate, especially those on the appropriation of bargains and the late booking of contracts. I would like them to be as strict as possible and include an obligation on authorised persons to make available for inspection by their clients any dealings carried out by their staff—that is staff with management or dealings responsible for large sums of clients' money—for any account in which such staff had a beneficial interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comfort me on that and help the committee to send a clear and strong message to the SIB of our worry and of our wish to have a strong system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the amendment and in the speech by the hon Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). His remarks bore directly on a worry of mine, with which he may be familiar—I have raised it on several occasions on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a series of abuses and irregularities—to put it no higher—during the flotation of the British Telecom shares. This is on record, as Ministers con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>761</span>
ceded in their answers to my questions that staff—or, as it was described to me, members of the team—at Kleinwort Benson, which advised the Government on the flotation, dealt in the shares. I do not want to make unsubstantiated allegations, but some of that dealing probably breached the rules that applied to ordinary members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Government, understandably, do not wish to concede too much on that front, they have recognised that it is unacceptable by changing the rules and making it clear to merchant bankers who may be in a similar position in the future that it is not to happen again. That is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of those activities during the flotation of the British Telecom shares strengthens the case for putting into the Bill a provision such as the hon. Member for Suffolk, South has suggested. The hon. Gentleman gave examples, and there are other instances of underwriting firms quickly crossing the line between their professional operations on behalf of clients and dealings on their own behalf when they realised that there was a substantial discount on British Telecom shares and that a good capital gain could be made within a day or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That abuse has to be dealt with firmly. The Minister may be able to tell us that the Bill covers the point adequately—I am sure that that is what he will say. However, the hon. Member for Suffolk, South has done a useful service by again drawing attention to what is the most offensive single abuse that can take place in the City against people outside. The clearer the Committee makes it that we want to stop that, the better a job we shall do for the City as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) in thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) for the amendment and for the way in which he moved it. I share my hon. Friend's worry about the personal dealings of employees in investments in which the company that employs them deals, either on its own account or on behalf of clients, or on which it advises clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 6 requires the conduct of business rules to
	<br><q><p>"promote high standards of integrity and fair dealing".</p></q>
To comply with that principle, a designated agency would make rules that cover the matters raised by the amendment. There may be some doubt whether the rule-making powers in clause 45 are wide enough to enable such rules to be made. We intend to permit such rules, and I shall consider the matter further—if the powers may not be wide enough, I shall bring forward an amendment to clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall express no view about whether that will lead to rules in the form that my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South would like, which included making information about the dealings of members or employees of firms available to clients. However, I shall do what I can to ensure that clause 45 is wide enough to enable rules of the sort that he seeks to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend and to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for his interest in and support for the issue. I look

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 271, in page 142, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(6A) The conduct of business rules must make proper provision for the disclosure by an authorised person of all costs, including commissions and other inducements and selling and advertising costs, incurred or paid by or to him and attributable to any such transaction, and of the management and administrative costs charged in respect of, and the surrender value of, any investments which are the subject of any such transactions.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 276, in page 142, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(6A) The conduct of business rules must make proper provision for the disclosure by an authorised person of all marketing management and administrative costs charged in respect of an insurance policy to which this Act applies and shall require the provision to a person who has entered or offered to enter into an investment agreement with an authorised person of an estimate, based upon the best information available to that authorised person, of the proportion of premiums paid over the life of the policy, or in the case of a whole life policy, over the expected life of the insured, which will be invested for the benefit of the policy holder.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This takes us back to our eleventh sitting, when we discussed many of the issues under clause 41. Most Committee members were persuaded by the Minister that clause 41 was not the appropriate provision in the Bill for dealing with the problem of disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have now reached exactly the right point in the Bill—paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6—to examine the matter. We should try to resolve some of the difficult issues which were only discussed—albeit thoroughly—at the eleventh sitting. Any doubt that remained after that debate—and there was substantial doubt—should be resolved now. As a result, the Committee's next message to MIBOC on the rules governing disclosure should be rather sharper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have re-read the record of our proceedings on that occasion, and I think that MIBOC could be excused for deciding—whether in good faith or otherwise—that our message was not as clear as it could have been. As the Minister resisted any notion to step in if MIBOC failed to respond to the Committee's view, we shall have to state what we want again. We must ensure that we resolve those problems either by incorporating amendment No. 271 and amendment No. 276 into the Bill or by obtaining the Minister's assurance that MIBOC fully understands out position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak briefly in support of amendment No. 271. The amendment is designed to fulfil two purposes. It is based on the principles of full disclosure and equivalence of treatment and seeks first to apply to all authorised persons. I hope that it is drafted in a way that makes no distinction between companies, intermediaries, tied agents and so on. The amendment is designed to cover authorised persons who incur or pay all sorts of costs, including commissions. It would cover the company which employed someone in the normal way, the company which employed a tied agent, the company composed of independent intermediaries, and independent intermediaries acting on their own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>763</span>
account. All those involved would be required to disclose the elements that arelisted in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals also with what is subject to disclosure. While singling out commissions, for obvious reasons, the amendment makes it clear that other costs should also be disclosed. If disclosure were to apply only to commissions, the independent intermediary could be gravely prejudiced. He would have to pay for other expenses out of his commission, which, of course, would be covered by the employer of a tied agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the average customer would respond unfavourably to the apparently higher commission charged by an independent intermediary. For that reason, the amendment specifies the disclosure of the promotional costs—incurred by selling and advertising—the management and administrative costs, and the surrender value of any investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I support the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, it could require such disclosures to be made in relation not only to insurance brokers but to stockbrokers as well. Does the hon. Gentleman intend that to cover, for example, the disclosure of commissions and of administrative and other costs in respect of the sale of unit trusts through a brokerage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The amendment refers to investments in general, which would certainly go much wider than long-term insurance policies, and the hon. Member is right to say that the amendment would have that effect. I shall not go so far as to say that it was intended to have that effect, but, if it were to have that wider effect, I am not persuaded that that would necessarily be bad. In the case of most other investments, it would be relatively easier to produce such information, but in the case of life insurance the problem of commissions and surrender values, for example, becomes more difficult. If the Minister accepted the general objective of the amendment, some better drafting might meet the hon. Gentleman's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 276, tabled by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr Butterfill), deals with surrender values better than my amendment. The requirement is more fully expressed and, therefore, may be more practicably workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other matters that we could debate under this general heading—for example, the precise definition of "disclosure" in a case governed by the amendment. Should it mean soft disclosure through an industry-wide agreement, or full disclosure in every case? Both amendments Nos. 271 and 276 leave the question open to MIBOC, and we expect to hear its view, but an industry-wide agreement would be desirable and people could not be prevented from entering into such an agreement or from saying that the commissions that they charged complied with such an agreement. That is straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would hesistate if I were a party to an industry-wide agreement which placed an intermediary in a different position in respect of disclosure from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
someone who was not party to that agreement. The best solution—perhaps MIBOC will consider that when framing its rules—is to require the same full or hard disclosure about the level of commission in every case, but those party to an industry-wide agreement would be free to disclose that, as an additional commendation of their method of business. That could not be excluded, nor would it be desirable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be unhappy if some people could say no more about commission than that it was within the approved agreement, whereas other people had to say "If you buy an insurance policy from me, I must tell you that I shall earn £500 commission on it." That would be unequal treatment and, therefore, undesirable. It would be better to be able to say "I shall earn £300 commission, which is within the permitted levels established by an industry-wide agreement", whereas someone else might have to say that his commission was £400, without being able to add the recommendation of the industry-wide agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether that point arises directly from the provision, but I commend the amendment to the Minister. I hope that he may concede that he wishes to intervene with MIBOC to ensure that the views expressed in Committee have an effect when MIBOC draws up its rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself closely with the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and I refer to the slightly different proposal in amendment No. 276, which I tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That amendment makes slight adjustments to the proposals in amendment No. 271, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman may consider as an improvement. First, it relates specifically to insurance business; secondly, it deals more specifically with surrender values; and, thirdly, it leaves the door open rather wider for MIBOC on soft disclosures than does amendment No. 271. Amendment No. 271 specifically mentions "commissions", whereas amendment No. 276 says "marketing… costs". That is the important difference. Even if all costs were disclosed, as both amendments envisage, but only independent intermediaries had to disclose the cash value of their commissions and tied agents could avoid such disclosure in some way—perhaps by a change in the status of their employment—the public might assume erroneously that they were getting better value from a policy sold to them by a tied agent than from a policy sold by an independent intermediary. The reverse should be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the argument of my hon. Friend the Minister when we last debated the subject that there is a danger that we leave out disclosure of commission differential. Nevertheless, it is important that the total marketing, administrative and other costs of management are declared. I draw comfort from the fact that this is supported by several submissions currently being made to MIBOC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer specifically to the submission made to MIBOC last month by the Linked Life Assurance Group. Recommendation 4 is that
	<br><q><p>"a Value Statement should be provided to the consumer with a cooling off notice. This Statement would give details of the esti-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
mated surrender and maturity values of the product at various durations on prescribed bases."</p></q>
That follows my amendment. The recommendation also says:
	<br><q><p>"Value Statements provide a helpful indication of the overall value of the policy being recommended. In covering all charges and costs they are more helpful than disclosure of commission which is only one element of acquisition costs."</p></q>
Recommendation 6 says that
	<br><q><p>"there may be a need to monitor commission levels in the industry"</p></q>
and that the LLAG proposes that
	<br><q><p>"commission levels should be lodged with SIB or an SRO in order that the market can be monitored."</p></q>
Such a proposal might meet the fears of my hon. and learned Friend regarding differential commissions, and so I hope he will agree that it may be possible for MIBOC to come forward with proposals that meet all the enxieties that the Committee has expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we last discussed the issue in relation to Clause 45, my hon. and learned Friend was kind enough to agree that those matters were sufficiently important to be referred as a matter of urgency to MIBOC with a view to obtaining from it as soon as possible proposals to meet the Committee's anxieties. I hope my hon. and learned Friend will agree that, without pressing the amendment to a Division, it is clear that a substantial majority of the Committee support the proposals in the two amendments. Although I appreciate that my hon. and learned Friend cannot prejudge any suggestions that MIBOC may make, I hope he can say now that he personally supports the views that the Committee has expressed and would be disappointed if MIBOC were not able to come forward with proposals that would meet the fears, anxieties and hopes that the Committee has expressed today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the sense of both amendments. They are important and I hope that the Minister can go some way towards accepting their principle, but I have reservations about the detail of both amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained the aspect of the amendment tabled by the hon. member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that causes me concern. The amendment seems to be drawn so broad as to include stockbrokers as well as insurance business within its ambit. The hon. Member for Dagenham was frank in admitting that, although that was not his primary intention, he was happy for such business to be included until he had heard the arguments to the contrary. I do not agree with the hon. Member. I believe that it would be confusing and practically unworkable to seek disclosures for business other than insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer the amendment of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) as it clearly defines the business for which commission should be declared and provides for information on other areas of insurance. Nevertheless, I am concerned by the requirement at the end for an estimate of future investment returns. It would be difficult to give such an estimate. Any estimates along those lines would be so loose as to be practically meaningless. The estimate would have natural knock-on effect on other charges
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>

The Linked Life Assurance Group, whose submission I referred to recently, thinks that my proposal is not only possible but desirable.

The legislation department of one association of British insurers is worried that the proposal may not be workable. The hon. Gentleman and I must make our own judgements. We can always pray in aid people to support us. In my view, the last part of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is a bit iffy when it comes to workability.

The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West made it clear that he supports the same principle as that adduced by the hon. Member for Dagenham in favour of his amendment.

The principle raised by the amendments is valid and important and should be incorporated in the Bill. I emphasise to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) that he needs to reverse his approach. He began with a courageous declaration that turned in the end into a cringe—a supplicant plea to the Minister. If hon. Members want to get anywhere, they must back their words with their actions and put their votes where their mouths are. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West might learn from the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
respondence from independent agents in my constituency. Mr. Martin Joy, a mortgage and financial consultant, wrote to me first, but I have received other letters. A letter from a Mr. Wrigley of Hewstone Life Pensions and Investments typifies their arguments. He states:
	<br><q><p>"Should the proposed legislation come into effect, there will be two detrimental effects.
	<ol>
	<li>Without disclosure and regulation of tied agents' commission, the consumer will not be able to tell whether commission bias is operating within the range of contracts, even though they may be offered by only one insurer.</li>
	<li>The host insurance company will be able to weight the commission payments to sell contracts that are profitable for itself and not necessarily for the consumer. Moreover, by enhancing commission and other benefits, it will be able to attract salesmen from the independent intermediary market to join its direct sales force. This would, of course, to a market distortion."</li></ol></p></q>
I see from the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of sitting No. 11 that it was argued that it was O.K.—in fact, it was necessary—for independent agents to tell a customer what commission they were getting from the insurance company because that would influence the advice that they were giving. The customer needed to know whether the independent agent was pushing him in the direction of a policy because it carried a bigger commission or because it was the best policy. The presentation of that information was essential to a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it was argued that that could not be applied to tied agents because they worked on a different basis, and it was only necessary for them to tell a customer "I am a tied agent for the Snopall Insurance Company, which employs me, and that it why I am urging its products." Since a tied agent would be urging only one product, it was said that it was not necessary for him to disclose his commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the distinction that MIBOC and Mr. Weinberg urged would be made between the independent and the tied agents. I do not necessarily agree with the headline in 	<i>Money Marketing</i> with states:
	<br><q><p>"Campaigners claim a win on tied agents".</p></q>
That is perhaps putting it too strongly, but as I read the proceedings of sitting No. 11 the feeling of the Committee was that the distinction was not satisfactory and there would be a greater element of disclosure from the tied agents. MIBOC was asked to think again on the basis of the Committee's discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the outcome of that thinking will be, but while it is going on it is important that we move further to specify in the legislation the feeling of the Committee about the appropriate extent of disclosure. I do not accept the distinction that independent agents should disclose and tied agents should not. A tied agent, although he is representing only one company, comes to the customer with a range of policies in his knapsack, or in his portfolio, some of which are advantageous to him because he will get more commission from them. That pressure to sell is present in a lot of negotiations, and the customer should know that a tied agent is urging a policy because it is in the agent's interests to push it rather than in the customer's interests to have it. A company may want to promote a particular policy and it will do that by offering more commission to its agents. That policy would not necessarily be in the interests of the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
Secondly, it creats a distinction between the independent agents and the tied agents, to the disadvantage of the independent agents. The customer could find the scale of the commission frightening and unacceptable if the independent agent had to disclose it, and he might go to the tied agent, who does not have to disclose his commission, in the mistaken belief that he will pay out less to him. Thirdly, there is always the problem that companies will juggle around the distinction between commission, salary and perks to conceal information necessary for the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the argument between independent and tied agents, the interests of the consumer should be paramount. We should seek maximum information and disclosure for the consumer about who is getting what out of him and what he is getting out of the money he is handing over. In other words, he should know what proportion of his policy payment will insure his life or whatever he wishes to insure and what is going to the other purposes implicit in the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not create a distinction between one section providing information and the other not doing so. We should go for the maximum provision of information to the consumer. Both amendments are major steps along that road. We do not necessarily have to choose between them as both have advantages. I accept the arguments of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West in defence of his amendment as against that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham. Both establish a principle which it is important to specify and include in the legislation. We should take the opportunity to opt for maximum disclosure to serve and protect the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw the Committee's attention to representations from my constituents. Colnbrook Financial and Investment Consultancy of 110 High Street, Colnbrook, Bucks., wrote to me on 13 February 1986:
	<br><q><p>"we feel all charges and commissions declared by all parties (intermediaries and tied sales forces) would be beneficial to the consumer and would discourage intermediaries or tied agents to recommend investments that only 	<i>they</i> would benefit from."</p></q>
C.V. Southerden and Co. of 4a The Broadway, Farnham Common, Bucks, wrote on 11 February:
	<br><q><p>"The Government…seemed determined to have a form of commission disclosure. Surely, then this disclosure must apply across the whole Life Insurance Market.

Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) the assurance that I shall be most grievously disappointed if I am unable to bring forward on Report an amendment to schedule 6 which would seek to make provision for disclosure of the kind he seeks in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and other hon. Members that I have made the Committee's concern clear to the chairman of MIBOC and asked him urgently to consider the two aspects previously canvassed in the Commit-

tee. The first is the identification of some kind of disclosure of commissions for tied agents to make them equivalent as far as possible to those of independent intermediaries, which was the subject of considerable previous discussion. The second aspect is the separate question of more general disclosure to purchasers of insurance policies, so that they can see what proportion of their outlay is invested on their behalf as compared to the proportion which goes on expenses. I hope that MIBOC will be able to produce solutions which will satisfy the House. I expect to produce an amendment to schedule 6 on Report that will enable such rules to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps that is unfair. The Minister has met us very well and given us the exact assurance that we sought. We are pleased to hear that he has already spoken to the chairman of MIBOC along the lines that he described. Unless the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my hon. Friend's absence, because the amendment stands in his name. It is an amendment to clause 97, the effect of which is to allow the Secretary of State, at the request or with the consent of the Securities and Investments Board, to make an order resuming all or any of the functions transferred to the board by the delegation order. Subsection (6) provides that such an order
	<br><q><p>"shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."</p></q>
This means that it is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will argue that it is designed to increase the flexibility of the arrangements, but my view is that the clause tends to undermine the independence of the Securities and Investments Board. Therefore, the resumption of transferred functions would be a major change in the arrangements for the regulation of authorised investment businesses, which should not be made only on the basis of being subject to a negative resolution. The amendment seeks to make the procedure subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of Parliament. If a major decision of this nature were taken, it is essential, in terms of accountability of the Secretary of State and of the board, that Parliament should give positive approval to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned only with resumption of functions at the request of the agency or with its consent. The purpose of the provision in subsection (1) is to be able to tidy up the boundary of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the agency, if experience suggests that it has been drawn in the wrong place. If it becomes apparent in operating the system that it would work better for a particular function to be returned to the Secretary of State, we need a simple procedure for doing that. I see no need to require parliamentary consideration of every such case. That would trespass unnecessarily upon Parliament's time. Instead, the clause provides that either House may annul the order, which would appear to be the better procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a very sympathetic response, but I am getting used to that kind of thing. In a spirit of co-operation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should consider for a moment why clause 97 is in the Bill. At present, the Bill is so drafted that the Secretary of State can either regulate authorised investment businesses directly or delegate any or all of the functions to the Securities and Investments Board. My concern all along has been about the board's independence. The clause would allow the Secretary of State to resume either all or any of the board's functions if he chose, with the consent of the agency or at its request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear from my hon. and learned Friend why the clause is in the Bill. He will probably
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>771</span>
argue that it increases the flexibility of the arrangements, but I think that the down side is that it undermines the independence of the Securities and Investments Board. I believe that the board's independence is much more important. As my hon. and learned Friend knows, I believe that it should be a self-standing commission and, therefore, that we should question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of the general line of argument advanced by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It seems to me that clause 97 has a place in the Bill in the light of the structure that was originally provided—that is to say, if the Securities and Investments Board is to be designated at some point but has to meet certain conditions, it is right that clause 97 should entitle the Secretary of State to withdraw that designation wholly or in part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however—as we should prefer and as the amendment is designated to open the way to achieving, although technically I agree that it does not do so—the Securities and Investments Board becomes a part of the structure created by the Bill, the process of making that body accountable in various ways can be achieved in a different way. It is no longer appropriate to hand over the powers and then to hold over the board the continuing threat that those powers may be removed. The ability to call the body to account would rest on statutory provisions in respect of reports being made and debated and on acting within the statutory rules governing its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could deliberate at length on all the provisions, because the same problem arises in each case. We are left in a curious state of limbo because we are not clear about the sort of board that we are discussing. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply to the point raised by his hon. Friend, as it shows the Committee's difficult position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amused beause Conservative and Opposition Ministers have spoken in the debate for two entirely different reasons. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said that he would like clause 97 removed because it would give the SIB more independence, which stands to reason. But the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that it is unnecessary and should be removed because the SIB will not have independence. If it were not removed, the Secretary of State could require the SIB to do whatever he wanted. That was the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, as I understood it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman has interpreted my remarks in that way, as a result of my infelicitous expression, but I intended to express a view similar to that of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), as we both want to see a self-standing commission. If we had run a commission, whatever accountability was thought to be desirable would be achieved other than through clause 97.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is the difference between Labour Members and myself. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) believe, as I do, that the designation of the SIB in the Bill does not preclude the possibility of its being in the image
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>772</span>
originally intended by the Minister, as a stand-alone commission, to which the Secretary of State did not dictate directly. That was why the hon. Member for Beaconsfield wanted to eliminate clause 97, but the hon. Member for Dagenham took the view that the commission might stand alone but was directly responsible to the Secretary of State, who, if he wished to alter it, could do so. That is the dichotomy of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making more of a supposed difference than is warranted. Indeed, I argue that there is no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we wish to describe the Securities and Investments Board as a self-standing, independent commission, it must look to statutory rules for a definition of its functions, powers and general rules. Those rules would inevitably deal with accountability to Parliament or any other body. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that there is a major distinction between my position and that of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my view, but perhaps the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will express his view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to see clause 97 removed, because that would take away from the Secretary of State a degree of flexibility that he should continue to have in the organisation as it stands. The organisation would be designated in the Bill but would be of a sort which the Government suggest as capable of operation outside the direct ambit of interference from Whitehall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the theoretical advantage of the flexibility about which the hon. Gentleman is talking, but, in practice, it has taken almost two years to set up the SIB. It is fiction to suggest that, if one did not like what the SIB was doing, one could withdraw recognition from it and suddenly another board would spring up, which one could recognise. It is terrific in theory but nonsense in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has missed part of the provision in clause 97 which states:
	<br><q><p>"an order resuming all or any of the functions".</p></q>
Therefore, the Secretary of State does not have to take back all the functions. He may take them individually, so there is no need for the 'nuclear deterrent' referred to by the hon. Gentleman. I should like clause 97 to remain in the Bill to allow an important flexibility in the absence of the direct SIB-to-state relationship sought, quite reasonably, by the Labour Party—although I do not agree with its reasons for that. I look forward to hearing the minister's reasons for wishing ti retain clause 97. It seems odd that the hon. Minister for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has tabled the amendment to give the SIB more independence, whereas the Labour party' view is that the clause should be removed because it is unnecessary as the SIB will not have independence from a state organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). It was interesting that both my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) have supported the removal of clause 97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I had the temerity to refer to the totality of the changes which would be a consequence of the amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>773</span>
ment to clause 96 and the removal of clause 97, which would have resulted from an amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) alone, it was pointed out to me that he was the only one who went so far as to seek the removal of clause 97. It now appeared that he is joined in that aspiration by my hon. Friend the Member for Beacons-field and by the official opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil is right to identify, as one of the critical powers contained in clause 97, the ability of the Secretary of State to revoke from the designated agency part of the powers that he has transferred to it. I ask those in favour of the amendment to clause 96 and the removal of clause 97 to ponder the effects of the changes that they seek to make. The amendment to clause 96 would oblige the Secretary of State, if he transfers his powers at all, to transfer them only to SIB, not only initially but forever unless there were a change to the legislation. He could not transfer all or part of his powers to any other agency, and once clause 97 was removed, after transferring his powers to SIB he could not revoke that transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result would be that SIB would be etablished and free-standing—a word which led to confusion on Second Reading and which I now understand although I do not like it any the more. It would be unaccountable to the Secretary of State because he could not revoke its powers. It would be able to make its own rules without reference to Parliament—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because the Minister rejected the amendment approved last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) should restrain himself. It is a serious matter and if he is seriously interested in a regime that will lead to enhance investor protection he should listen to the points that I am making. What is being created is a body whose accountability is reduced substantially although its powers and independence have been increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers the system of investor protection which the Bill is designed to achieve—not simply the extent to which the designated agency is independent or free-standing—especially the role of the Secretary of State, one realises that it is substantially weakened by the amendments being urged on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately did not seek to intervene sooner because I was interested to see how far the Minister would go in painting that ridiculous and remarkable picture. Surely he must have known—and I imagine that every member of the Committee could see what was going on—that he was painting a picture of a Securities and Investments Board which has been changed in one small respect by the amendment to clause 96 agreed to in Committee but that he refused to consider the further changes which were clearly in the minds of those who voted for the amendment and which are an essential part of the changed SIB which we wish to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be right—in that sense I am surprised that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) supported him—if we make no further changes to clause 96. However, he knows that we have spent a lot of time today arguing for the Committee to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>774</span>
be allowed to make further amendments that would be consistent with our different view of the SIB. We seek to establish an SIB which, like every other statutory body, is given powers which it can exercise without a sword of Damocles—provided by clause 97—dangling above its head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Using great ingenuity, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) attempted, in his proposed schedule 5, to draw up a body that was statutory because its powers were set out in the statute but which in all other respects was as identical as possible to the private sector agency originally contemplated in the Bill. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) now says that the body will be a statutory commission like all other public sector bodies, so it will be accountable in the same way as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members cannot have it both ways. They must decide what they want, how they will provide accountability and how they will avoid all the disadvantages that I sought to bring to their attention during the debate on clause 96.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith) can defend himself, but in his defence I must say that he has made his intentions clear. He voted for the amendment to clause 96, tabled a new schedule to replace schedule 5 and, on the question of accountability and whether the powers should be handed over by one hand but withdrawn by another, he spoke in favour of removing clause 97.1 am not necessarily doing the latter, but I am saying that our difficulties on clause 97 are typical of the problems now facing the Committee. However, the hon. Gentleman cannot be accused of inconsistency. He has a coherent view which I broadly support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting not that my hon. Friend's argument was not consistent within itself but that an inconsistency had appeared between my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Dagenham. It will be interesting to see how each of them proceeds to solve the problems of accountability that remain as a result of their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has conceded that the arrangements in clause 97—to give a private body powers to make rules that have the force of law—are unprecedented. I

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon and learned Friend keeps saying "some of the powers", but the clause clearly refers to all the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "All or any".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it says "all or any". I want to deal with the question of "all" first and then come on to "any".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the possibility that is clearly in the Bill that the Secretary of State takes back all the powers. The word "all" appears in the clause and I want to address myself to that. It is meaningless in practice because the Securities and Investments Board was first set up in the summer of 1984. We have now reached March 1986 and it has still got a long way to go to get its act together. The idea that recognition could be withdrawn from the SIB and then we could wave a wand and there would be another body that we could recognise and that could do the job better is nonsense. My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) clearly agrees with me. He is banging the table in agreement with my words. I know that, privately, he has considerable sympathy with my views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the question of "any". Here my hon. and learned Friend has a stronger point, but we must distinguish between the situation as the Bill was originally drafted, where I fully accept that it would be appropriate, and the situation as the Bill has been amended, where it would be less appropriate. For that reason, I am not well disposed towards clause 97.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DESIGNATED AGENCIES: STATUS AND EXERCISE OF TRANSFERRED FUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 143, line 6, leave out paragraph 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment illustrates the difficulties with which we are faced. The Government have been obliged in paragraph 2 of schedule 7 to go to the lengths of exempting the Securities and Investments Board Limited from the need to call itself a limited company. That reveals how uneasy the Government are about allowing a private company to take on the substantial powers created under the Bill. The fact that the Government have had to go to such lengths should put everyone on guard that there is something about the structure of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Committee were to accept the amendment, I have no great hopes that by striking out the provision we should do anything significant. If under clause 96 the body that was to exercise those considerable powers, including rule-making powers, were to be called the Securities and Investments Board Limited, many eyebrows would be raised, not only in this country but, more particularly, in those parts of the world where people are likely to want to trade in the London market. When they came to London they would find it incomprehensible that the apparatus of regulation was in the hands of a private company called the Securities and Investments Board Limited. The Minister ought to explain the reason for the provision, because I suspect that he might find some slight embarrassment in having to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment gives us the opportunity to discuss the public relations aspect of the designated agency. When people learn that the policing operations of the City are effectively in the hands of a private company, they will be most upset. The reason why the exemption is in the Bill is that the Government, recognising that fact, are intent on ensuring that the fact is hidden from the investing public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public's perception to policing arrangements is generally that policing arrangements are in the hands of publicly accountable authorities and not in the hands of private authorities. I believe that the Government recognise that fact, too, and know that if the SIB were to be known as the Securities and Investments Board Limited it would lack all credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
