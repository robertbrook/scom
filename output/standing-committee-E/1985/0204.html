	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHAW 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='page-header'><h1>Financial Services Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the last sitting of the Committee the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) asked me to reconsider my ruling, in connection with amendment No. 48, that liabilities are not investments. The hon. Member pointed out that in clause 1 "investment" is defined as meaning
	<br><q><p>"any asset, right or interest".</p></q>
I have given further thought to this matter, but I can find no grounds for changing my ruling. A liability as such cannot be regarded as an investment, or as a right or an interest. A Lloyd's underwriter could, of course, be held to have an investment in the profits of his syndicate. There is a conceptual difference here between the two. For this reason, the hon. Member's amendment No. 97 is also out of order. I am sorry to have to give the hon. Member that information but, as promised, I have announced my decision at the beginning of the sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I am grateful to your for the thought that you have given to the matter and for your explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the position in which amendment No. 97 originally stood, your reasons might well have applied. Whether or not I agree with them is neither here nor there, but where amendment No. 97 is placed now, it is purely a definition. Although you may regard that definition as wrong, or perhaps even frivoluos, Sir Michael, surely it is open to members of the Committee to put forward anything they like as a definition at this stage in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is hypothetical. If hon. Members think that way, they will doubtless table amendments to the interpretation in part IV of schedule 1. If and when such amendments are tabled, I shall look at the actuality, but I do not propose to rule on any theoretical definition that may or may not be tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add what I said at our previous sitting. The usual channels are there to help and I advise the hon. Gentleman to make full use of them. I can rule only on facts. I do not want to rub this in, but when I looked back carefully over the debate I realised that much of the discussion was indirectly a discussion on my ruling and I am not prepared to continue to have my rulings discussed. There is not a fact here, but a theoretical proposition and I am not prepared to rule on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT BUSINESS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [30 January], No. 67, in page 133, line 28, at the end, to insert the words
	<br><q><p>"provided that in each case the Secretary of State is satisfied that the body corporate makes available to those persons before they enter into any such transactions independent advice from a person who is authorised to give it under this Act and who has no connection, other than for the purpose of giving that advice, with the body corporate or any body corporate connected with it.".—	<i>[Mr. Gould]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I restate briefly the nub of my argument in support of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I had made it clear that the Opposition were entirely in favour of employee shareholding and recognised the advantages of providing a mechanism by which that could be facilitated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I sought to persuade the Committee that, for perhaps three reasons, it would be unfortunate to leave employees in a share shop without recourse to independent advice. First, those employees were likely to be among the least experienced of investors. Secondly, they were operating in a context where they were likely to be at their most vulnerable, because it would be a familiar context and they would be meeting other workmates and perhaps superiors. Thirdly, it was a context in which there would be a great possibility of insider information being available to some of those trading. For those reasons, it seemed to me that special account had to be taken of the need to provide independent advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a number of points in his reply. First, he said that the Bill was not primarily —indeed, at all—intended to regulate ordinary transactions between private individuals. Of course, I accept that. But the purpose of setting up an employee share shop is to make that not an ordinary transaction; it is to provide, in a sense, a form of market place, the mere provision of which would, in ordinary terms, be regarded as conducting an investment business. That is the reason for the precise exclusion in paragraph 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot simply take refuge in the notion that those are transactions between two private shareholders. It is a special situation which the Minister is quite rightly anxious to encourage. I am equally anxious to ensure that that is nevertheless properly regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point concerned the requirement that independent advice should be provided. He said that that would add to the cost of the operation and would, therefore, be a disincentive to those who wanted to set up such a share shop. My rejoinder was, as I recall it, that all forms of protection for the investor and regulation of markets cost something. If we were simply to accept the cost argument, we would never have set out on the course in the Bill. I am not, therefore, persuaded by that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
I was about to deal with the third point of the Minister's rebuttal when the sitting ended at 1 o'clock. He said that adequate protection would be provided by the provisions of clause 44—which creates the offence of making misleading statements—and that they would protect an employee who had been improperly dealt with. Again, I find that pretty unconvincing and unpersuasive because one is not taking a view in respect of investment business generally, when one says that the criminal law is sufficient protection. Otherwise, again, we would not have embarked on the course set out in the Bill. It is precisely because the simple creation of criminal offences, and then the rather cumbersome application of the criminal law, have proved to be ineffective, that we have—quite rightly, in my view—attempted to set up a proper structure of regulation and investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to be arguing that, in this case—where I argue that protection is especially desirable and necessary—we can go back to the pre-Bill position and, quite happily, rely on the provisions of the criminal law. That is not a good enough argument or protection for people in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible—I am always optimistic in such matters—that, in the four or five days since our previous sitting, the Minister has had the opportunity to look again at the arguments, which may have been new to him at the time. He may be prepared to take a slightly more constructive approach to the problem. It would not wound me if he were to say that he does not like the solution proposed in the amendment, provided that he were prepared to say that he recognises that there is a problem and that, as the provision stands, inadequate protection is provided for people in that especially vulnerable position. I propose to regain my seat in undimmed optimism, and in the hope that the Minister can help us in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on share ownership. Employee share ownership has long been dear to my party's heart. The Government have borrowed some of our clothes, perhaps, but in any event there is now wider share ownership among employees. That has to be a good thing—whoever thought of the idea in the first place, and whoever put it into legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's rhetoric in favour of employee share ownership would receive more support if they were prepared to offer employees specific safeguards and rights under the Bill in the way the amendment proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not rehearse the Minister's arguments on clause 44. The hon. Member for Dagenham was right to say the clause takes us back into the old criminal law position that existed before the Bill was introduced. Surely the Minister must recognise that it is to the advantage of both the Government's policy and of employees that a specific first-line safeguard is provided by ensuring that those who offer the advice are covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
That is the bones of the case for the amendment. If the Minister rejects it, we are bound to conclude that his true heart does not he in employee share ownership but in allowing the City fairly free rein, while we believe that the emphasis should be in the opposite direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister does not wish to accept the precise wording of the amendment, we would be satisfied if we would offer to achieve the same result in any other way. The arguments the Minister offered at our last sitting were inadequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervened briefly on Thursday to suggest to the Minister that he might do his homework over the weekend and come back to us wim information on the scale of arrangements we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been able to discover it; the Library of the House has not found it easy to extract the information. The Minister must know the scale of the operations, and I am surprised that he has not sought to put the information before the Committee and that he is excluding what may eventually be a large number of share transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand Government policy, it is in favour of further privatisation and of the development of these schemes. The Bill therefore covers an expanding market in share dealings. The very whiff of scandal that might surround a future abuse of such arrangements would surely be of great embarrassment to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government at this stage of their legislative timetable on fraud and other operations in the City, and in the marketing of securities and shares, would surely want to intervene and to be seen to be setting up a regulatory framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred specifically to the least experienced and vulnerable areas of our society involving themselves purchasing shares. I wholeheartedly agree with him, but would go further. At places of work —certainly on the shop floor—we all too often see a deferential relationship between the employee and the employer. I can foresee circumstances in which the employer might by some means coerce the employee to transact his shares. The Minister may say, " He would only wish to do that if he had inside knowledge of the future movement of the share price." But in those circumstances it would be almost impossible for an employee to bring an action or to report his employer for using his inside knowledge of the company's affairs to coerce an employee into either buying or selling his shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must address himself to that possibility. The way in which he is replying to the debate suggests that he is protecting the rights of those who may wish to abuse their knowledge when transactions take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham referred in part to what the Gower report said about the matter, but I shall read the whole paragraph.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
It is important that, before the Division, the Committee and those outside the House know what the report said. At paragraph 3.08 Professor Gower said:
	<br><q><p>"I also have some misgivings, as have the City Capital Markets Committee, about the suggesed exclusion (White Paper, paragraph 4.17 vi) of ' the provision, by a company of a " share shop" for its employee shareholders to exchange the company's shares between themselves '. While there may be no need for formal ' authorisation' of such facilities, if the intended result is that deals in such ' shops ' are to be totally free from regulation there seem to me to be grave dangers."</p></q>
grave dangers—The report continued:
	<br><q><p>"A company's employees are likely to differ greatly in their degree of sophistication and inside knowledge of the company's financial position and prospects. Moreover ' employee shareholders' presumably include all those covered by an ' employees' share scheme' as defined in section 87(1) of the Companies Act 1980 and thereby embrace former employees and ' the wives, husbands, widows, widowers or children or step-children under the age of 18 of such employees or former employees'. A ' share shop' appears to provide a facility which will enable the more sophisticated and those with unpublished price-sensitive information to deal free from the statutory constraints on insider dealing which apply only to stock exchange deals."</p></q>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Gower report was fierce on those matters. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said, that was a powerful statement. Professor Gower said:
	<br><q><p>"I also have some misgivings, as have the City Capital Markets Committee ".</p></q>
Has the Minister been in contact with the City Capital Markets Committee? Did he consult it prior to replying to the debate? What discussions and meetings took place, what representations have been made and, has the committee had the opportunity to comment on the Minister's recent interim comments—I hope that they were interim comments—in the House? If the Minister has not had time for such consultations, does he not think that in the circumstances it would be wise to solicit the committee's view on the absence from the Bill of provisions in this area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister carry out such consultations? As we have raised those matters so frequently, will he go further and undertake to make some changes on Report? If die Minister cannot undertake to make changes on Report, will he at least take our comments on board and consult the City Capital Markets Committee? Perhaps he will carry out a little research on share exchange and transactions and make a statement on Report on the back of an amendment. Perhaps the Minister can at least tell us before Report whether he is able to take further action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's brief response, most of which was unfortunately spent attacking the Labour party and its policy on employee share ownership, did not address what I believe is the central issue of the debate. The thousands of people outside who buy and sell shares will operate in a totally unregulated framework, apart from the general rules
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
on insider dealing. They are the most vulnerabla people, they need protection and they look to the Minister to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by dealing with the factual points raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for information about existing share shops. Two employee share shops are licensed under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958. One is the National Freight Corporation Share Trust Limited, which on four dealing days during the year makes a market for employees. The second is for employees of Blue Circle Industries, which buys bearer share warrants issued to employees. Only £8,524 worth of bearer share warrants are in issue against a total issued share capital of £117 million, and that total will diminish as holders either sell them or convert them into registered shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not refer to these matters earlier in the debate because I accept that what happens now is not necessarily the best guide to what may happen in the future. Share shops may in the future be used much more widely to facilitate the buying and selling of shares between workers in a company than these two isolated examples would suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I know which route the Minister is taking, but may I make another suggestion to him? Would it not be possibe to design a framework of an association of companies that run share shop arrangements, and then lay down a code of practice governing their operation, to which employees who join in the transactions can at least refer and can then know what criminal law would be available in certain circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is more substantial than that, but if the Minister canot accept it, will he accept the possibility of an association or code of practice—a gently regulatory framework—for dealing with the problems that we are outlining?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the practice grows and share shops multiply, companies operating such facilities may well wish to form an association and promulgate a code of practice. That does not mean that it would be appropriate for the law to intervene in these matters as the Opposition have suggested. I have already explained precisely why that would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other question asked by the hon. Member for Workington to which I should reply, about consultation with the City Capital Markets Committee. Discussions have taken place with that committee on that matter. The committee have not pressed the point to which it is recorded as having assented in Professor Gower's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that we are discussing dealings—buy-ng and selling of shares in a company—between employees and their close relatives. To talk in that context, as did the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
Ashdown), of allowing the City a free rein, is to give vent to fantasy a million miles from the subject matter of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points here. First, the question of cost. Cost is a signicant factor in this context in particular, because we are referring to small numbers of shares being exchanged between employees, and costs which may be insignificant in the context of large dealings may be a significant deterrent to employee shareholdings when the numbers purchased in the first place, and the numbers being exchanged between workers, are small. We do not wish to introduce any deterrents to such dealings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister believe that introducing a safeguard for employees is introducing a deterrent? The evidence is precisely the contrary: wherever stronger safeguards exist markets are used more effectively by ordinary people who believe that their rights are protected. Secondly, why does the Minister believe mat he must await until share shops become more common, as he told the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), before considering the possibility of introducing such a safeguard? If he did so now, might not share shops become more common in consequence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would listen to what I said, his interventions might be slightly more to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not suggest that safeguards—which I shall discuss shortly—would constitute a deterrent. I said that cost would constitute a deterrent, and that the added cost of dealing in small numbers would constitute a deterrent both to the ownership of shares by employees in their company, and to dealings in and exchanges of those shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not say in answer to the hon. Member for Workington that the Government would instigate any kind of statutory regime governing these matters if share shops increased and multiplied in future. I said that if that were to occur the companies that operated such facilities might wish to form an association of the kind to which he referred, and that that association might care to provide a code of practice governing those dealings. Both the points raised by the hon. Member for Yeovil had little to do with what I said in reply to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the Minister's argument on costs. Surely one advantage that both the Minister and the Opposition see in setting up and encouraging employee share shops is that the normal costs of concluding transactions, the commissions paid to brokers and so on, would be avoided. Therefore, the cost of independent advice must be set against what must be the greater cost— I agree that there is an argument there about small volumes—which is the commission normally paid by such people to brokers and others for obtaining their shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. However, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) should follow the path pursued by the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
for Yeovil and try to provoke me to be more aggressive than I have any intention of being. It is all too common for Labour Members to suggest that doing away with one cost is a reason for imposing another, which is the argument he put frward. He said that there was no reason not to impose another cost on workers, because the normal costs of dealings do not apply to exchanges of share ownings between workers. That is a peculiar logic with which the hon. Gentleman is familiar, and which we are used to hearing from him, but it is not the kind of logic that will persuade my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practicalities of the situation illustrate the impracticability of the amendment. We are talking about buying and selling—the exchanging of shares between workers and their close relatives. One construction of the amendment suggests that the employer should provide facilities for the exchange of information on whether an employee wanted to buy or sell shares. By providing a notice board on which a worker could pin a notice saying that he was prepared to buy or sell, an employer could, as a result of the amendment, incur the liability of needing to provide investment advice to people who wanted to pursue such a transaction. Such a state of affairs would be manifestly absurd, and we would not want to encourage it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oppositions Members may say, " Yes, we agree that that is absurd and we do not want to cover the provision of a notice board. However, we want to cover a proper share shop where people go to buy and sell shares in the company ". But if that is what they wish to do, workers could go to the share shop to obtain the information on who wanted to buy or sell shares, step outside the share shop to engage in the transaction, and the employer would then escape the need to provide proper investment advice on the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine the practicalities of an exchange of shares between private individuals, which would not normally come within the scope of the Bill, we can see the absurdities and impracticalities of the amendment and why it is needed. Therefore, I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard myself as a junior Member; I was elected in 1979. The Minister was elected in 1983. When I started attending Committees, I learnt that Members—especially Opposition Members—often table amendments because they have limited resources at their disposal while Governments have whole Departments. Such amendments are often probing ones, which seek to establish a point and an undertaking from the Government that they will examine the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may feel that our amendments do not meet the objectives of the legislation or are defective, but they may accept the principle. We have set out to argue a principle. We accept that our amendment may not be the way in which to resolve the difficulty.

The Minister should accept that a difficulty may arise, but there must be a solution, so will he try to find it? When we discuss future amendments, I hope that he will not set about their clinical destruction as a sadistic ritual,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister is so au fait with court procedure that he does not understand our motives. Will he accept that he has a wider responsibility, which is not simply to dissect amendments but to understand the principles that we advocate?

Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) raised a valid point. There could be a problem. We must accept that employee share shops are on a small scale at present, but we should acknowledge that it is an expanding sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my hon. and learned Friend, the Minister, said about the difficult practicalities of trying to administer a regulatory regime and that the proposal in the amendment would be cumbrous and expensive. However, it would help if my hon. and learned Friend would expand on what he said about clause 44 providing the required protection. How does he envisage clause 44 being applied in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must wait until we come to clause 44 before discussing the details of how it will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle of the amendment is simple and straightforward and it is absolutely necessary. There is a form of involvement for employees, and in order to avoid problems that may emerge, there should be a code of practice. We are pointing out a problem to the Minister and simply asking him what can be done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received two replies from Conservative Members. First, the hon. Member for Cash and Carry said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Could the hon. Gentleman please look on the paper in front of him where my constituency is written down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is better to discuss colleagues by using constituencies, which is the normal practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asking which constituency the hon. Gentleman represented because the paper is not in front of me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the Minister has powers to act, but that is not the response we received from the Minister. The Minister, who is sensitive because of our criticism of his involvement in Lloyd's, is raw and anxious on that point and is now treating all amendments and suggestions of principle as personal criticism, or personal attacks. The Minister should learn to dissociate his own vested interest from the points of principle in the argument. The Minister has rejected an important point of principle out of hand. That is an unsatisfactory approach. Furthermore, we should vote on the amendment because of the Minister's blithe refusal to accept that our argument is valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful for the recognition, at least, from the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) that there was a real point at the base of the amendment. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! Stafford; thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stafford was offering us something that would be an answer to all such questions for ever. However, that it not our function as a Committee. Our function is to put the necessary legislation in the Bill and not simply wait for some possible future exercise by the appropriate Minister of some general power to amend by regulation. That is not a sufficient answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and I were disappointed with the Minister's reply. I was somewhat taken aback when he castigated us and recoiled from the prospect that the law might intervene in these matters. That was an extraordinary statement for the Minister to make given his own professional background and the fact that, by definition, the Bill suggests intervention by the law. I assume that the Minister has no objection in principle to the law intervening in these matters, but we are looking at whether the law in that particular situation should provide the same protection as is provided in other cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister attempted to belittle the importance of the matter by referring to—paraphrase— " just a handful of employees". Professor Gower pointed out that the provision goes wide and potentially involves a large number of people. It involves shares not only in one company but in a whole group of companies. Therefore, potentially we could be dealing with a considerable body of business, particularly, if, as I am sure is the Government's intention, employee shareholdings become a more common phenomenen. That is likely to become an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point of costs, my argument that in a normal transaction costs would be incurred by way of commissions and so on, was designed to bring
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
out the point that the reason why costs are incurred in such a transaction is not that people want voluntarily to make gifts to stockbrokers but that by employing a professional broker and paying commission they are provided with a form of protection. Once the Bill takes effect, they will have the protection of an authorised person who has taken on a professional responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suggesting that some protection should be provided in the circumstance envisaged by paragraph 19. The fact that costs might be incurred as a consequence is not a matter for concern. Any protection will involve a cost. It is difficult for the Minister to base his argument on cost when trying to reject our attempt to provide some form of investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be right in saying that the amendment would sweep up too much, and might impose its requirements on notice-boards and other such devices. But does the Minister not recognise the real point? The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon and Professor Gower recognise that point, and so did the City Capital Markets Committee at one stage, although we are not privy to its subsequent conversations with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should let us have a copy of the letter from the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. Why does the Minister not recognise the real issue, and devise a practical solution? He stated that there are at present only two share shops that meet the criteria. But we would all agree that the number of such share shops is likely to increase substantially, and they will deserve some protection. Surely it is not beyond the Minister and his draftsmen to identify those share shops and to separate the notice-boards and other devices. Surely they can at least provide some protection where a proper market place and institution is set up to facilitate such transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the Minister's impassive face and from the occasional, barely discernible shake of the head, that he does not propose to accommodate us any further on the matter. If that is so, and if there are no other interventions, I propose to press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. At our first sitting, we had a thorough debate—and we are grateful for your indulgence—on the question of the Minister's interest in Lloyd's. You gave your ruling on what was essentially a point raised at large, in the general context of the Committee's business. That ruling was clearly based on the House's own rules and did not—quite rightly—take account of the question of ministerial rules. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility to apply those rules to the Minister concerned. I have raised the matter with the Prime Minister, but have still not had a substantive reply to my letter. So we are still no more enlightened about whether the Prime Minister intends to enforce those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Your ruling, Sir Michael, was firmly based on the appropriate provisions in "Erskine May", which strike at a direct pecuniary interest. You said:
	<br><q><p>"The hon. and learned Gentleman has assured the Committee that he has no direct pecuniary interest." 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 28 January 1986; 	<i>column 26].</i></p></q>
Therefore, you said that you would not disallow his vote on any occasion in Committee, and that you would not commit a motion to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of your ruling, I have looked at 	<i>Hansard.</i> Opposition Members attempted to show that the Minister has a pecuniary interest. The Minister replied that he had ceased to underwrite and was no longer a member of a particular syndicate, but he gave no assurance to the Committee of the sort to which you refer. In other words, at not point did he state, " I have no direct pecuniary interest." Perhaps that is because it is incontrovertible that he has a direct pecuniary interest, a case in point being the size of the cheques or the bills which will land on his doormat over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's defence was not that he had no direct pecuniary interest but the question whether that interest would prove to be an asset, an obligation or a liability would be determined by commercial factors beyond his control. Therefore, the Minister was telling the Committee that there was no conflict with his public duties because the Bill does not affect his interest. The thrust of our argument was that issues that might arise—such as whether Lloyd's should be included within the ambit of the Bill—would have precisely the consequences for the Minister that he was disposed to deny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you, Sir Michael, therefore consider whether your ruling—which you based on a point classified by " Erskine May "and to which you were guided by the Minister's supposed assurance—was based on a misapprehension about what the Minister was telling the Committee and whether the Committee's deliberations will involved a conflict of interests of the type which may jeopardise the Minister's position on the Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
I therefore seek leave to move, Sir Michael, that the Minister's vote should be disallowed on that ground, rather than on the grounds that you mentioned in your original ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I may be allowed to deal with the first point of order. I gave the ruling in die way that I did because I believed that it would be helpful for the Committee to understand the full position as I saw it so that interventions or motions of the sort that the hon. Gentleman now wishes to bring forward, would be unnecessary. However, this is the first such intervention and I shall deal with it in detail. I hope that the Minister will then respond so that we can clear up the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from "Erskine May" as reproduced in 	<i>Hansard:</i>
	<br><q><p>"No Member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question is allowed to vote upon it; but, in order to operate as a disqualification, this interest must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character."</p></q>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly quoted, I then said:
	<br><q><p>" The hon. and learned Gentleman has assured the Committee that he has no direct pecuniary interest which would prevent him voting on any part of the Bill."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 28 January 1986; c. 26.]</p></q>
We are all hon. Members, and I accept, prima facie, what an hon. Member says unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, which I have not so far seen in this case. In the circumstances, if the hon. and learned Gentleman will assure us that, bearing in mind the further argument, he can still make that statement, the matter—and my ruling— must rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do that. You said, Sir Michael:
	<br><q><p>"The occupant of the Chair is concerned only with the question whether an hon. Members' pecuniary interest is so direct and personal as to cause him to permit a motion that hon. Members' vote on a clause, once cast, should be disallowed."—</p></q>
Having given the history of my involvement with Lloyd's and explained my present position in detail, I said:
	<br><q><p>"For those reasons, I have no immediate personal interest in the Bill and I hope that that explanation makes my position clear"—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 28 January 1986; c.13–26.]</p></q>
I repeat that. From your wording, it follows that, as I have no immediate personal interest, I have no direct pecuniary interest that disqualifies me from voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under those circumstances, I rule on the matter. I hope that it is set at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 134, line 6, leave out "necessary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 68, in page 134, line 8, at end insert
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
	<br><q><p>"and (c) which is not held out as advice on investments which is generally available from persons carrying on that profession or business."</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 75, in page 134, line 10, leave out " remunerated " and insert "charged for ".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 21 of schedule 1 deals with
	<br><q><p>"advice given in course of profession of non-investment business."</p></q>
—It is of critical importance to professionals— solicitors, actuaries, accountants, and so on—when, in the course of giving mainstream advice, they give incidental advice about investment. The question whether a person is committing a criminal offence may turn on the meaning of the word " necessary."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an entirely new situation. The position of accountants has had to be considered under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958. When the rules under that Act were revised in 1983 the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, of which I am a member and the parliamentary adviser, issued a statement, which repeated what had gone before. It said:
	<br><q><p>"The Department of Trade has authorised the Council to state that in the opinion of the Department professional persons such as accountants and solicitors who may in their professional capacity arrange for the purchase or sale of securities for their clients or who may deal in securities in the course of administration of deceased's estate or as liquidator trustee in bankruptcy, or similar professional capacity, would not ordinarily be held to come within the restrictions of Section 1."—</p></q>
that is of the 1958 Act—
	<br><q><p>"In its application to members of the Institute, this opinion would apply only to dealings which are incidental to the professional services rendered to clients by a member in practice."</p></q>
It concluded that that was the limit to the exception and that there was no general exception for accountants and solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the existing position. What will the position be under the Bill? What does "necessary" mean? What sorts of advice do the Government have in mind in paragraph 15 when they include the word "necessary"? We need practical examples, as there is uncertainty in the minds of those who have been considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some think that no advice can be regarded as necessary to other advice. Some think that what is necessary is a subjective matter for the adviser. Some think that "necessary" means unavoidable. If it does, the exemption will have hardly any perceptible effect in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was raised both by the Institute of Chartered Accounts and the Association of Certified Accountants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and I do not really seek to remove the word " necessary" because clearly some sort of restrictive adjective must be included. We would welcome any guidance from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 is less important. It seeks to leave out the word "remunerated" and insert the words "charged for" to cover cases in which no separate bill is issued. If there were a separate bill,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
it would be obvious that separate advice was being given. That would not be clear if there were only one Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reiterate the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), in so far as it relates to my own profession of chartered surveyors. In many property transactions, such as the sale of a house or a commercial property, a life assurance policy may be taken out as part of the funding of the transaction. Therefore, a chartered surveyor or someone in the similar position may be asked to give advice on the totality of the transaction which could, as the clause stands, include what could be construed as investment advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith), I have tabled an amendment that is primarily probing. However, I suspect that it is probing in a different direction from that of the amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman. I sympathise with him when he says that the word " necessary " is rather vague. Will the Minister tell us what is intended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more doubtful about amendment No. 75, which would seem to enable the professional to ensure that the advice given is always outside the scope of the Bill. All. that he would have to do is make sure that there were no separate invoice for that advice. One can imagine professional people rapidly falling into the practice of never charging separately for anything that can be called investment advice. That would be undesirable. There has to be a test that does not rely on something that is entirely in the hands of the person concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of amendment No. 68 is to acknowledge that there is unease about the scope of the exemption. The relationship between professional people and the regulatory structure proposed by the Bill is a difficult area—how do solicitors, chartered accountants, and so on, fit within the framework of the Bill? The answer provided by the Bill is that they can obtain authorisation by becoming members of a recognised professional body. Even that is a concession because they do not require direct authorisation under the aegis of a self-regulating organisation. Nevertheless, they have that option and it is probably the right solution. I would not cavil at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is unease about the extent of the further exemption. It arises from the proposals of the Marketing of Investments Board Organising Committee about the rules that are applied to intermediaries. Solicitors, accountants and similar professionals are some of the most obvious and common sources of investment advice, as pointed out by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much investment advice is proffered and accepted in the course of property transactions or management of the estates of deceased persons. Many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
people are alarmed at the MIBOC proposals that professional people should meet less onerous rules about best execution, and so on That rings a few alarm bells, and makes us anxious to establish the precise limits of any such exemption. We accept that we do not want to drag into the net of the Bill a whole range of people who are, in no real sense, offering investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I estimate that many professional people are offering investment advice yet on die criteria laid down in the exemption in paragraph 21 may escape the obligations imposed by the Bill. It is therefore extremely important that we do not allow the exemption to be too wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of my amendment No. 68 is clear; it seeks to add another criterion. I suspect that in many cases a professional person may be able to avoid charging separately for investment advice, and to argue that it was a necessary part of a wider body of advice. However, in some of those cases, he will be offering a range of professional services which, explicitly or implicitly, include his supposed expertise on investment. If the professional person holds himself out as offering advice on investment, even if he does not charge separately for that advice, he ought to be brought within the scope of die Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the amendment may not be drafted in such a way as to achieve its purpose, but the Minister will recognise our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional people are as much subject to the temptations of conflict of interest as anyone else. Solicitors, managing trust funds and so on, providing mortgage finance to clients, and handling sums of money passing through accounts face endless possibilities of conflict of interest. It would be most unfortunate if, in some way or another, die average professional man were to bring himself within die exemption and escape the provisions designed to protect die investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that solicitors and accountants are already subject to high standards and to strict rules on, for example, client accounts, whereas some of those to be regulated under the Bill are subject to no control whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes my point. I accept what he says. We have yet to see whether solicitors and accountants in their respective professional bodies meet die requirements laid down in die Bill. One assumes that they will and that they will in due course become recognised professional bodies. But there may be other groups of professional people—it would be invidious to single out examples—where the profession does not provide that degree of protection. If paragraph 21 were to prove sloppily drafted, it would allow major opportunities for professional people to escape the regulatory provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is dealing with matters which to a certain extent come under clauses 15 to 20 of the Bill, although I know that there are considerable difficulties in constaining the argument on schedule 1 because it interlocks with other provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that we shall be able to return at the appropriate time to the question of what is, or should be, a professional body. When the Minister responds to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) I hope that we shall deal with those, rather than go into the entrails of the subject now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) keeps trying to take on part of your role, Sir Michael. For the record, may I say that we are content to leave that to you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's concerns have no real substance, and that we will have a full debate on those clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has perhaps seen what I am driving at. Will he say how he sees paragraph 21 operating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to say a few words on amendment No. 74. The involvement in investment business of solicitors, accountants and chartered surveyors has been described as a grey area. I endorse that widely-held belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in addressing the Committee is to urge caution on the Minister when he replies to the debate. Although there clearly has to be a definition, I feel strongly that the one denned in schedule 1 comes close to the best compromise. The Minister may be well advised, therefore, to resist the temptation to accept the amendment moved so persuasively by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must declare an interest here, as the parliamentary adviser to the British Insurance Brokers Association. There are no prizes for guessing that I am seeking fairness in regard to the results of the Bill, whether investment advice be subsequently given by an accountant, a solicitor, a chartered surveyor or an insurance intermediary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be an unquestioned fact that accountants, for example, must inevitably give advice on tax mitigation, and that that is part of their reason for existence. It also appears to be a well-known fact that one of the most effective instruments of tax mitigation must be a life assurance or endowment policy. It is equally self-evident that, in many cases, such policies will be on a with-profits basis or linked to a unit trust. If that does not involve an element of investment advice, I have misunderstood the purpose of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
Let me deal with house purchase. Once again, any recommendation made by a chartered surveyor or an estate agent may have an endowment with-profits policy as the vehicle for repayment. Surely, therefore, an element of investment expertise is assumed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, let me return to the involvement of accountants—'that is why I deferred giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) a little earlier. Surely they are among the leading people to give advice to self-employed people on how to mitigate tax by the effecting of self-employed retirement annuities. Once again, the benefit of effecting such an annuity is not just that £X will be available on retirement at age 60 or 65, but that £X, which is the product of investment in a with-profits pensions contract, will be available. Surely, there is an assumption that an accountant or a solicitor, recommending such a course of action to a client, should possess some investment expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue. I am not suggesting that if an accountant advises a client to take out a retirement annuity policy, for example, and thereby gains a commission, he should enjoy the benefit of that exemption. But what happens if the account says to his client, " I think you could benefit from one of those policies. Why don't you go and see an insurance broker?" Could he then benefit from the exemption? That is the question which we should consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been involved in the world of insurance intermediaries for many years before and since becoming an hon. Member. I am bound to say that I have not experienced to a great degree the circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend. On the contrary, there is considerable competition—as he, surely, will be the first to concede—between accountants and solicitors on the one hand, and professional insurance intermediaries on the other. I am not seeking any advantage for insurance intermediaries. I am simply seeking parity between accountants and solicitors on the one hand, and insurance intermediaries on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said that solicitors and accountants are already required to perform to high professional standards. That is, of course, perfectly correct, and we welcome that. But, with respect, they are not high standards of expertise in investment. As I understand it, that is the object of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I did not suggest that, where chartered surveyors or estate agents are acting as insurance brokers and selling policies, they should be exempted from these provisions. Clearly, they would not be so exempted. I am anxious that, as the clause is drafted, because many property transactions and, indeed, investment transactions, are funded through policies by clients, in giving advice on the totality of the transaction—which may include a policy derived from a source such as an insurance broker—a chartered surveyor or other professional adviser may find himself caught under this schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting back to a debate that we had in our previous sitting: whether an instrument, in the form of an endowment or whole-life policy, on a without-profits basis, is an investment in accordance with the aim of the Bill. I am reluctant to be taken down that road again as we had a fairly good debate on that subject, but my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) may unwittingly be moving back towards it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I justify my intervention by repeating to the Minister that, in the light of all these circumstances and because all I wish is to achieve fairness as between the various professional advisers, perhaps he should be cautious before eliminating before what I consider to be a necessary word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, after the disagreeably sharp conflict on the previous amendment, we may now resume a reasonably harmonious course in relation to these and successive amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that anyone who holds himself out as offering investment advice, even if only in the course of giving other advice or providing other services, should be required to be authorised. I share that objective, but I do not think that the amendment is necessary in order to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exclusion granted by paragraph 21 of schedule 1 is deliberately narrowly drawn. Two criteria have to be met before the exclusion is available. First, the advice must be given in the course of carrying on a profession or business which does not otherwise constitute carrying on investment business. Secondly, the advice must be a necessary part of other advice or services given in the course
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
of carrying on that profession or business. The condition that the advice must be "necessary" is very limiting. "Necessary" means that without giving the investment advice in question, the function of giving other advice or providing other services could not properly be performed. Any advice that goes beyond that is not "necessary". We have deliberately not gone wider and included " incidental" advice, as that seemed to us to create too wide a loophole. A whole range of investment advice might be included in the term "incidental", particularly when, for example, advising on a client's tax position or winding up of an estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Necessary" advice in these circumstances is much more limited. It would cover, for example, advising that part of a share portfolio should be sold before the end of the tax year to take advantage of the capital gains tax exemption, or advising for tax reasons considering investing in a business expansion scheme, but it would not include giving advice on which shares within the portfolio should be sold—unless there was a tax advantage in selling one lot of shares rather than another—or on which the BES scheme would be the best investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take some of the examples cited during the debate, advising that a with-profits insurance policy should be taken out would be regarded as coming within the definition of "necessary". To go beyond that and advise which sort of with-profits insurance policy should be taken out would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the narrowness of the exclusion, the amendment is not necessary. All that a person could hold himself out as offering, while still being eligible to benefit from the exclusion, would be "necessary" investment advice. That would hardly be a selling point as anyone who came to' him primarily seeking investment advice would constantly have to be told "Sorry, I am not authorised to give you advice on that point." The paragraph as drafted, therefore, achieves the objective we share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation answers the first point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beacons-field. He also raised a separate issue. Subparagraph (2) provides that if investment advice is separately remunerated it is not covered by the exclusion. Separate remuneration is used as a simple test which demonstrates that the investment advice is a separate activity and not a necessary part of some other, non-investment, activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggests substituting the words "charged for" for "remuneration". The effect would be to ignore for the purpose of this test any remuneration which is not charged for, or billed, by the person giving the advice. The most obvious example of such remuneration is commission. When an accountant, for example, obtains investment advice from a stockbroker for a client, the accountant receives a share of the commission from the stockbroker. Similarly, he gets a commission if he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
puts his client in touch with an insurance company or unit trust manager and the client subsequently purchases an insurance policy or unit trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's suggestion would mean that this commission was ignored in deciding whether the advice given by the accountant was, or was not, an investment activity for the purpose of the Bill. I do not think that it should be ignored. I agree that in the case of a purchase of unit trusts or an insurance policy, the accountant's role in advising on the purchase would, in any case, probably go beyond " necessary" advice, but the payment of the commission will be the easiest way of determining that some investment activity—beyond necessary advice—has been undertaken. So the proposed change would considerably widen the exemption and I would take a lot of convincing that it would be desirable to go so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged by the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Mc-Crindle) and I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the thrust of the Minister's arguments on amendments Nos. 74 and 75 and was encouraged by his remarks on the general question raised by amendment No. 68. I am sure that we share an objective here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only question arises on the weight to be placed on "necessary". The Minister will be aware that his remarks on the subject will not be taken into account if the matter is ever litigated. Although I understand his argument, is not a possible problem that a court might be persuaded that the giving of such advice would almost certainly be in the context of a fiduciary relationship? In other words, there may be a duty to give best advice—a common law principle of best execution—and so it may be difficult for a professional person to say, " But I did advise " or " I did not advise "—depending on his argument —" that investment should be made in this or that share because ' necessary' did not require me to say that. My duty is to tell you to avoid tax by adjusting your investments in a certain way."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not there a danger that the courts might say, "Your duty as a professional man, who owes a professional duty to your client, is to advise him."? It could be argued that it was " necessary" to advise the client to invest in certain shares because they would produce a manifestly better return than the investment that was made and resulted in a total loss to the client. The courts could say that the person giving advice should have been aware of that and should have advised his client accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's apprehension but it is misplaced. I see no difficulty in a person saying to a client, " It would be to your advantage to sell some of your investments before the end of the tax year so that you will qualify for the exemption from capital gains tax. I am not qualified or authorised to advise you which shares to sell and you should not rely on me for any such advice. If you want such advice you must go to a stockbroker or another adviser who is authorised
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
and qualified to give you that advice." The line between the two is reasonably clear and there should be no difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are not authorised to give investment advice should have no difficulty restricting themselves to giving advice in princple, while pointing out that if the client requires advice on which particular shares should be sold, he should consult another adviser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said that this was a grey area. I am not sure whether he meant that there was not much information about the amount of investment business undertaken by professional people. The Institute of Chartered Accountants commissioned a full market survey last year. When we debate the relevant clauses it may help the Committee if I bring the facts and figures to show that the amount of business undertaken by accountants is not substantial in comparison with the main part of their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable and learned Friend the Minister has given the Committee some helpful guidance on the extent of the exemption. Common sense suggests something along the lines that he proposed, namely, that an accountant giving tax advice can say that a certain investment will have tax consequences. But that if he goes further and advocates particular investment instruments he will clearly be giving full-blown investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of my hon. and learned Friend's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 92 covers an important question of principle, which is of wider significance than the operations on the market. I hope that the Minister will approach the amendment with more charity than he has shown to previous amendments. If his reaction so far is supposed to be high flying, it seems dreadfully like low flapping.

It has been the straightforward approach of lifting up the great red book of negatives and reading a prepared reply without even considering our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given die stench and whiff of corruption arising from die City and the air of scandal hanging over it, it is important that where we can provide proper controls and management and ensure proper publication of what is going on, we should do so. Amendment No. 92 provides just such an opportunity. I hope that instead of automatically reading with some deterioration of style and grammar from the red book of negatives, the Minister will try to enlarge his sympathy to cover me amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 15 of schedule 1 deals with
	<br><q><p>"Giving, or offering or agreeing to give, advice as to the purchase, sale, subscription for or underwriting of investments"</p></q>
which covers tip sheets. They are a specialised aspect of the market. Many of them have a restricted circulation of only a few hundred or a few thousand. They are usually obtainable only on subscription and so are circulated to the cognescenti— informed, intelligent and astute people—and to some Conservative Back Benchers. Tip sheets provide information on which to make investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tip sheets are a specialised field which should be regulated, but that regulation should also be extended to the wider field of share tipping in newspapers, which is excluded from the Bill. Such exclusion is die wrong kind of logic. We should be concerned with what journalists and newspapers are doing rather than with what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newspapers such as 	<i>Money Mail</i> and others have a wider circulation and circulate to people who particularly need protection. They do not circulate to the cognoscenti, the informed section, those in the know, but to a large group of people who may want to get involved in the market and to buy shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people may be more subject to influence than the informed groups who go to the trouble of paying for tip sheets, such as the Rosemary Burr tip sheet. I am thinking of publishing the Austin Mitchell tip sheet, which will demonstrate how to go bankrupt fairly quickly, and publish gossip about Grimsby. Recipients of such tip sheets—apart from mine—need less protection than newspaper readers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new class of people are coming forward who may be influenced by newspaper recommendations. They may be people without the right background or information and who are much more at risk than the specialised section. In making their recommendations and suggestions about share buying, journalists are particularly susceptible to the influence of their self-interest and involvement in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only to read 	<i>Private Eye</i> to know that. I read it primarily to find out about the new recruits to the counterjumperocracy among Conservative Members, but it illustrates how a newspaper correspondent writing about share recommendations, can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
be influenced by his own buying, his own self-interest and benefit. There have been numerous examples, although I cannot quote from 	<i>Private Eye</i> as it is a privileged periodical and what it says cannot be repeated in this context. However, journalists are open to such influences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Humbert Wolfe said:
	<br><q><p>"You cannot hope to bribe or twist, Thank God! The British journalist."</p></q>
However, the recommendations of motoring correspondents are obviously influenced in their judgments by the provision of cars, holidays and trips overseas. We can see the same susceptibility to influence among financial journalists. The weakness, inadequacy, susceptibility and openness to influence of journalists is shown by what is going in Murdoch newspapers at present. I do not know whether a journalist from 	<i>The Times</i> is present, as the wind is not blowing from that direction. However, as a Labour Member, I must express the wish that he will not report what I say—as usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A body of journalists who had their proprietor over a barrel because of his financial over-extension in the United States agreed to sell out their principles and betray the print workers for what amounts to 33p per year to each journalist for each print worker's job lost. That shows how open to influence journalists are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an illustration of the activities of the Wapping Liar and the Wapping Sunday and the other newspapers—journalists were driven in closed buses, as Lenin was taken through Germany in 1917. Out in Wapping people are open to influence, where ideas spring naturally from the soil like rats as they are in a stimulating, exciting environment from sewers. Even in their fortified emplacement— the Fiihrer bunker—they may be open to influence in their financial recommendations. I mention that to show how journalists can be influenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a Press Council code " The Press Council Declaration of Principle on Financial Journalism," which was issued because of the number of problems that have arisen because of journalists being open to influence and using their recommendations to make speculative profits for themselves. It states:
	<br><q><p>"financial journalists should not use for their own profit information which comes into their possession as a result of their jobs before that information has become public."</p></q>
That recommendation demands almost a superhuman degree of principled detachment from the speculative opportunities of the market. It continues:
	<br><q><p>"Journalists, however, should not write about shares or securities in whose performance they or their close families have a significant financial interest".</p></q>
That demands a high principle. It goes on:
	<br><q><p>" Journalists should not buy or sell, either directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities about which they have written recently…. Financial journalists
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
should not speculate by buying or selling shares and securities on a short-term basis. Journalists should never buy or sell shares or securities about which as a result of their employment they possess unpublished information".</p></q>
I read those to show the degree of risk. We do not know whether those Press Council recommendations are observed strictly by the financial journalists who make recommendations to an audience that is peculiarly susceptible to influence and vulnerable to that sort of management. It is essential and desirable that journalists observe that code, but we do not know whether they do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inadequacy of the code reflects the general inadequacy of the Press Council. It is a mechanism of discipline without teeth. We now have the opportunity to provide effective registration and more information about the influences working on journalists. We should not just narrow the definition to the strictly technical matter of tip sheets. The readers do not require that protection. Those who pay out several hundred pounds a year for tip sheets are gluttons for punishment. Journalists influence investment decisions—they give advice and act similarly to the tip sheets for a section of the community that is vulnerable to mismanagement. Journalists offer advice that could benefit their self-interest, so it is important to bring that activity into the scope of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wapping is further away than Fleet Street. I shall endeavour to direct my attention more closely to matters in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's considerable experience in the media. His reputation as a media performer exceeds his reputation as an hon. Member. In the light of the hon. Gentleman's considerable experience—which I understand is continuing, for I believe that he continues to appear in the media—does he share the anxiety expressed earlier about declarations of interest, and does he feel that he has an interest to declare in relation to the amendment because of the no doubt substantial income that he draws, and perhaps could even increase if the amendment were accepted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the National Union of Journalists and derive a small income from journalism, but perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Can we return strictly to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Sir Michael. My reason was that, because of the hon. Gentleman's great probity, he would be much in demand if standards had to be raised to such a level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
I shall mention two further reasons why I believe that the amendment is important. I believe that the whole Committee welcomes the fact that there are hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, more individual investors today than a few years ago. The existence of that great new army of investors brings new problems. The vast majority of those investors will not have a professional adviser of their own to consult about their investments. The only advice on which they act will come from their friends or colleagues and above all from the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the experience of the market that those investors have had is limited. It is of the type that makes them peculiarly susceptible to advice from the press. That is because to date they have experienced only rising markets. Many new investors are vulnerable because their experience will suggest to them that shares can only rise in value in the long term. That makes them more than usually dependent on advice from the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that also advice coming from the financial press is the type of advice that says: " We recommend share A as more attractive than share B." That suggests that newspapers will be a powerful influence on those individuals' investment decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 22 suggests, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby points out, that subscribers and readers of tip sheets need the protection of the Bill, but I share his view that someone who takes the trouble to subscribe to a tip sheet is almost certainly at least slightly more sophisticated in his approach to investment than someone who does not. The investor who does not so subscribe will take only a general interest. We shall find, therefore, that readers of newspapers—who are a much larger number—are in greater need of protection than subscribers to tip sheets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument that I can see in support of the distinction is that, although the newspapers maintain a high standard—the hon. Gentleman has referred to the Press Council's declaration of principle on financial journalism, and I certainly wish to cast no aspersions on the press—the opportunity for abuse and malpractice in the giving of financial advice is undoubtedly considerable. No one could suggest that the Press Council declaration provides the high standards imposed by membership of a professional body, which we were debating earlier. It is only a declaration and depends on a good deal of voluntary compliance to be effective. Even taking the existence of the declaration into account, I am not convinced that newspapers should be excluded from the scope of the Bill. Amendment No. 92 may be the answer, but I am also interested in amendment No. 10, in the name of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), which has a great deal in its favour. The protection offered in that amendment would satisfy me, and I hope therefore that my hon. and learned Friend, will be able to respond positively to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the remarks of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) on amendment No. 10 it might be as well that I speak

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
to it now. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's offer of support. I am also grateful, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), for the great compliment paid to him. We all know my hon. Friend's towering reputation as a Member of Parliament, and if that reputation was exceeded during his television career, he must indeed have been colossus in that field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The excellent part II of Professor Gower's report gives a very useful commentary on recent developments on the subject. On page 18, paragraph 3.06, Professor Gower says that while he can well understand why the Government have made the distinction between tip sheets and newspapers he regards it is "regrettable". He then refers to the difficulty of defining "bona fide newspapers", but says that newspaper columns are
	<br><q><p>"the source of advice most relied on by private investors and that (unlike local bank managers) can by their columns influence share prices to a greater extent than almost any other advisers. Hence it is particularly necessary to ensure that their advice is competent and objective and that it is not abused in their own self-interest."</p></q>
He then goes on to speak of effective codes for journalists, which are applied by the better newspapers. That issue is raised in amendment No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower identified the major elements of the subject, and therefore I do not need to re-emphasise them. I and my hon. Friends subscribe to Professor Gower's expression of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the advent of give-away newspapers and so on, it is becoming increasingly difficult to draw lines. It is less a question of who the journalists are, what their jobs are, and the precise form of the publication in which they express their views, than of what advice they offer, the nature of that advice, who it reaches and its likely effect. That is the test that should be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Television has already featured in the debate, but so far as I am aware no television programme has yet dared to venture into discussing particular shares as possible investments—even though there are programmes such as " The Business Programme" and " The Money Programme ". There is a good reason for that, and it should apply equally to newspapers: television is a powerful medium and it would be extremely difficult for such advice to be offered via the television screen without getting into the difficulties we are discussing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If television programmes were ever to offer advice, I hope that the Minister, or his successor, would move quickly to amend the schedule to ensure that television was brought within proper control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments do not go quite as far as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby which seeks to sweep away the whole exemption. I am not averse to his suggestion if no better solution can be found, but my amendments offer two possible halfway solutions to our shared anxiety.

effect; we ought to judge publications on the basis of whether they are likely to influence people in making investments. If that is the case, whatever their purpose—I believe that purpose is irrelevant here—if the effect produces such investment advice the exemption should not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Professor Gower specifically referred to an effective code being a necessary safeguard if the general ambit of the exemption were to be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Press Council's declaration shows immediately that there is need for a code. To be fair, the Press Council says that it does not see the need for a statutory regulation or a rigid national code, but it does set out what is, to all intents and purposes, a code, and advises people to abide by it. As with so much of what the Press Council does, it is purely voluntary and has no teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment proposes that the existence of a code should be a condition, looked at by the Secretary of State or the designated agency, for granting the exemption. That provision, which would be met by the majority of responsible newspapers would allay the fears and doubts of Opposition Members and, I suspect, also those of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depending on how the debate goes and what the Minister has to tell us about his attitude, if the hon. and learned Gentleman is unwilling to accept one of the lesser amendments, we would wish to vote on amendment No. 92 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby. However, we will wait to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with die views expressed by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)—I was tempted to call him the hon. Member for Fish and Chips in view of the way in which he treated my constituency—my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Bill is basically about self-regulation. I am unaware of any way in which the Press Council would be able to self-regulate, as it were, on behalf of journalists in the way in which even the professional bodies and chartered bodies would be able to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) says that there is no difference, but for practical purposes we are concerned that part of the advice given to millions of people through newspaper columns and journals: for example, 	<i>Investors Chronicle</i> and many other reputable and important publications, do not provide the opportunity for people to know whether that advice is the right advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
if one is to impose a principle of self-regulation to ensure that an unsuspecting member of the public can rely on standards of knowledge, competence, discipline, training and so on—accepting the high quality of much of the advice that appears in publications—there is a strong case for those not being excluded activities under Schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman not noticed letters to the editor about financial difficulties in newspaper columns? They are agony financial colums and those who reply often give detailed financial advice which is perhaps more relevant than advice given by professional advisers sitting in offices in the City. Thousands of people take decisions on the basis of that advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's tone verges on the slightly aggressive and what he is suggesting helps my argument. The hon. Gentleman is probably so surprised to hear me say that the matter should not be an excluded activity that it has thrown him off his perch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well remember, although it is a long time ago, someone called Kenneth de something or other—the name may ring a few bells with hon. Members— who issued publications and became involved in fraud. It is unnecessary to mention the gentleman's name in more detail, but some hon. Members will probably recall it. The matter became completely out of control. People invested substantially on the basis of the gentleman's advice, circulated in unsolicited journals which he printed and published at his own cost. That is the sort of issue with which we should be genuinely concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely convinced by amendment No. 10, tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham because, although he mentions the Gower report, he refers to the prevention of
	<br><q><p>"any abuse or conflict of interest".</p></q>
I would rather say that it is important to remember that an unsuspecting member of the public may rely on the advice. The self-regulation required, and the mechanism of the SROs—which, as I said earlier, I entirely endorse—fit well into this context, although I foresee practical difficulties in application. The Minister and his advisers should look at the matter carefully because, for members of the public, competence lies at the root of the issue. Can we rely on the advice given? The issues of negligence and reasonable care flow from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to the matter. I am not inclined to vote contrary to the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), or indeed, by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee for long. I am a little confused because the Government's logic here does not appear to stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take the Minister through it, so that, when he replies, I can understand why he has included the provision. As I understand it, he accepts that published articles can have an impact on investment decisions. If he did not accept that, he would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
not have included tip sheets in the measure. According to his explanation of the principal of the Bill, those who are more exposed should be subject to more safeguards. That is why the rules governing, for example, the business of institutions, which can be expected to have a certain level of expertise and professional knowledge, are different from those governing business of the public, who may not be presumed to have such knowledge. As I understand it, the principle of the Bill is that the greater the exposure and the ignorance, the greater the safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, in drawing up paragraph 22 of the schedule, the Minister appears to have departed from the logic of that principle. He accepts that published information can affect investment decisions yet, contrary to the general principle of the Bill, he is providing more safeguards for those who are considered to be more expert and professional in such matters. Members of the public, who are less endowed with the knowledge required to make judgments, have fewer safeguards. That does not make sense in common justice, equity, or the logic of the Bill. The logic of the Schedule does not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to address his comments to that, so that we may better understand his logic, if he were to oppose amendment No. 92, tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), which I support in preference to Amendment No. 10, tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). If we could reasonably assume that the Press Council had the teeth to enforce the criteria laid down in its Declaration of Principle on Financial Journalism, that would perhaps be less necessary. But the Press Council itself agrees that a safeguard in this matter is necessary. We know, from unhappy experience, that when it comes to the Press Council putting those principles into practice all too frequently it does not have the ability to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems also that if we accepted the amendment we should be taking a general set of principles not significantly different from those laid down in the Bill. As the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) said, we are making it possible for someone taking that advice not only to be assured of its probity but, as a last analysis, to have recourse to the civil courts to overcome any disadvantage or damage suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most confused by the Minister's logic in wanting to include paragraph 22 and I hope that he will elucidate on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to measure the cumulative advice of all those who write in newspapers on investment management we should probably find that, in terms of its effect on numbers of people, it outweighs all the advice given by professional organisations generally who have professional expertise, Millions of people read newspapers and it is distinctly possible that many make their decisions on the basis of the advice that they are given in newspapers. I am surprised that the Minister sought to include the exemption in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood the reluctance of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) to impinge on the privilege of 	<i>Private Eye.</i> I assume that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
he expressed that view because he wants to escape comment in that journal. He was correct in saying that 	<i>Private Eye</i> is Uttered with examples of journalists who have used their position to advise. In my view, 	<i>Private Eye</i> has gone as far as making libellous statements for which it has not been brought to court, so I assume that there must be some value to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from the Press Council's " Declaration of Principle on Financial Journalism " and draw a distinction between that and what would happen if amendment No. 92, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby, were carried. The Press Council's declaration begins:
	<br><q><p>"The Press Council considers it undesirable for the professional conduct of financial journalists to be subject to special statutory or governmental regulation. It believes however that there are generally recognised ethical obligations and restraints which should be accepted voluntarily by journalists who write or handle financial material and by the newspapers and magazines which employ them.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The Press Council declares as a principle that financial journalists should not use for their own profit information which comes into their possession as a result of their jobs before that information has become public."</p></q>
It then sets out the declaration in detail and goes on:
	<br><q><p>"The Press Council acknowledges and welcomes the general support already given by editors and journalists to the spirit of this declaration. It recognises also that in some cases newspapers and periodicals go further than the guidelines it has set out."</p></q>
But it does not say what happens if people default. It does not illustrate the form of sanction that might be available to it. As yet, I have not heard of a case where a financial journalist has been disciplined by a newspaper management. It is significant that when the Press Council published its declaration on 6 June 1985 knowing that the Bill was coming forward, it did not make a statement on what powers had been retained and accepted by the National Union of Journalists to deal with such matters. However, we do know that if journalists are authorised under the recognised professional organisation arrangements or, if they are directly organised, they will become subject to clause 54, which says:
	<br><q><p>"If it appears to the Secretary of State that any individual is not a fit and proper person to be employed in connection with investment business or investment business of a particular kind he may direct that he shall not without the written consent of the Secretary of State, be employed in connection with investment business or, as the case may be, investment business of that kind—."</p></q>
Clause 54(2) refers to disqualification and says:
	<br><q><p>"A direction under this section (" a disqualification direction ") shall specify the date on which it is to take effect and a copy of it shall be served on the person to whom it relates."</p></q>
The Bill contains substantial powers to ensure that if journalists were authorised and they defaulted, they would be subject to a discipline that does not seem to be exercised at present by the management of newspapers. If that discipline were held over journalists as a sword of Damocles, it would to some extent restrain any excesses. It might at least make journalists consider their position when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
giving financial advice and it would ensure that they adopted the highest possible principles and integrity in their dealings with the general public through the financial columns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have effectively put the case that journalists are in a strong position to influence decisions on investment advice. When the Minister replies, he must either accept our argument and include it more substantially in the Bill, or reject it. If he rejects it, he must prove that journalists have no influence on investment decision-taking by the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been rich in classical allusion. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) referred to the sword of Damocles. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to his hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) as a colossus—presumably the colossus of Rhodes, of which no trace persists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for the conclusion reached by all hon. Gentlemen's who participated in the debate, who looked at the provision in the light of investor protection. They all put forward cases of considerable strength. I may not accept every detail of their cases, but I do not dissent significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower considered the matter from a similar point of view, and he and hon. Gentleman have left out of account a simple fact. I do not suggest that that fact makes the decision easy, but it poses a problem. The considerations of investor protection, which might bring investment advice in a newspaper within the scope of the Bill, are in direct and stark conflict with a principle that has little to do with investor protection—namely, that we should be jealous to guard against statutory interference with the editorial content of newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of no precedent for statutory interference with the editorial content of newspapers. I suggest that by accepting the amendments, we would take the first step down a slippery slope to press censorship. That is my argument, and it is for hon. Gentleman's to weigh it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the Minister' expertise in legal matters, but surely such a restriction already exists. For example, to protect the individual, the libel laws place on newspaper editors certain legally based constraints with civil sanctions. What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is this. The law of libel has its origins in our common law. The operation of common law has been modified and in many ways limited by statute, but it is not a novel intervention by statute in the editorial content of newspapers. That is the distinction between the law of defamation and what is here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point in relation to the laws of libel, but the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) is surely right that there

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
are many statutory interventions creating criminal offences, of which newspaper proprietors have to take account. The legislation on race relations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obscenity. There is your answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obscenity, blasphemy—one could go on. There are many criminal offences, some from common law and some from statute, to say nothing of the much more direct and secret intervention by the executive on matters such as D notices. The Minister will have a slight difficulty in convincing the Opposition that he is on a strong point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is there, and the distinction between the various; matters that the hon. Gentleman has raised and the point that we are discussing is that, whereas they are applications of much wider principles which apply only in part to newspapers, we are here concerned with the direct question whether we should deal with newspapers as we do with tip sheets, which has been posed by many members of the Committee, or whether we should recognise the dangers of the precedents that we would be creating by intervening in this way with the editorial freedom of the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a sharp point of conflicting principles and interests upon which we have to decide. We must look at it from a wider standpoint than has been taken so far and wider than that from which it was seen by Professor Gower. I recommend that primacy should be given to the principle of not interfering with the editorial freedom of the press, and I recommend the Committee to reject all the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is becoming traditional in this Committee, I find the Minister's reply extremely disappointing, but for reasons different from the usual disappointing reasons that he provides. We see now the operations of a lawyer-like mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that, with a Prime Minister such as we have, lawyer-like minds are of great value in vetting the statements that the Prime Minister might make and in presenting the case for the Government. That has to be cleverly lawyered. In this instance, however, the Minister's technique varied from that which he habitually uses. His standard technique in replying to important Opposition amendments is to fail to see the point. Now, after the bitter personal attack that I launched upon him at the start of this debate, he has decided to change that tactic. He will see the point and accept it. He will say that it is wonderful and absolutely correct, but that there is a greater principle which he will then trundle in, presumably from the Bench beside him or perhaps from the recesses of his own mind, which negates the point which has had so powerful an effect on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, the principle that he has trundled in to negate our argument is just not relevant What is asked is not that there should be a restriction on what the press says. In so far as there is any such restriction, that lies in the Press Council's code. We are trying to give teeth to that code. We ask that those: people who are in an investment business,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
because they are offering investment advice to a peculiarly vunerable section of the community, shall be registered and regulated, and shall behave according to proper and high standards laid down in the Bill. Therefore it is their behaviour which is to be regulated. One would hope that they check the advice that they are now giving to ensure that proper standards are maintained and that they are observing the Press Council's code. We do not know that that is so, but we seek to give teeth to the Press Council's code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the amendment represents a restraint on editorial freedom. That is nonsense. It is a restraint on the behaviour, the susceptibility to influence, the potential for corruption, of those who are giving the advice. It is a requirement that they be regulated. It is not a restriction on editorial freedom. I should be the first to reject any restriction on editorial independence, as I was the first to object to the advice given by my own national executive committee last week on communications with journalists from The Times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was an interference; this is not. For the Prime Minister I am sorry, I know that the Minister is a high flier, but I have projected him too far; what an unctous form of flattery that was, Sir Michael for the Minister to trundle in such a principle, to negate an argument that he himself has accepted, makes for an adequate and fallacious style of reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult issue, but I support the judgment made by my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary. A great principle is at stake and we should think carefully before taking powers to limit editorial freedom. I should have thought that that principle would commend itself strongly to Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach adopted in the Bill is consistent with its general philosophy. Where we reasonably can, we should trust to practitioner-based regulation, and if that turns out to be unsatisfactory, it may be necessary to take stronger powers. We accept the important principle of which my hon. and learned Friend has reminded us, and we remember the philosophy and strategy of the Bill. Therefore, I support my hon. and learned Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support my hon. and learned Friend. I do so for one good reason—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many good reasons, but I wanted to give one more. In dealing with other areas, we are describing people who give advice on investment and who directly earn their livelihoods from that advice; however, that does not apply to financial journalists, who earn their livelihood from writing columns in newspapers, and not from commission or other returns in respect of investments that they quote. That difference is vital, and fundamental to our consideration of the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the schedule be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might we take the opportunity, Sir Michael, of a brief debate to elucidate an important question on the ambit of schedule 1 and the definitions contained therein?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has tried—unsuccessfully—by way of two separate amendments to raise the question whether Lloyd's falls, or should fall, within the ambit of the schedule. I understand and sympathise with your ruling on both occasions, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil has perhaps inadvertently, drafted his amendments in a way that brings in the whole of Lloyd's insurance business as well as the investment business. I do not know whether that is in order; however, I should make it clear that Opposition Members do not wish to see Lloyd's insurance business brought within the Bill's framework. We are content that that should continue to be regulated by the insurance division of the Department of Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the hon. Member for Yeovil and I are at one on the important question of the investment business conducted by Lloyd's. That is a major issue which we intend to return to when we reach clause 40, which specifically excludes the investment business of Lloyd's council and of Lloyd's underwriters. Without that exclusion, any investment business carried out by those people and by that body would fall within the Bill. Therefore that investment busines starts by falling within the ambit of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That view is taken by a number of people, although it is perhaps not shared by the legal advisers to Lloyd's. It would be helpful now and in the future if we could get that point straight. Is it the Minister's understanding of the ambit of schedule 1 that it covers investment business carried out by Lloyd's? If so, we can proceed to debate clause 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before going any further, I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Gentleman put his point. However, I hope that there will not be a general debate on clause 40 yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir Michael, for the opportunity to explain how the Government see the ambit of schedule 1, and the extent to which it would cover the activities of Lloyd's, were it not for clause 40. The conclusion that I have reached is perhaps surprising. It is not the conclusion that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) indentified; it is not, indeed, my original conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by saying how the schedule does not cover Lloyd's. As everyone knows, members of Lloyd's carry out insurance business on their own account with unlimited liability. Paragraph 10 of schedule 1 includes certain long-term insurance contracts as investments. Hon. Members will recall debating at a previous sitting how long-term contracts that are covered as investments should be excluded if they are taken out purely for the purposes of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most contracts written at Lloyd's are contracts of general insurance, and not long-term insurance. Lloyd's began by writing marine insurance. It has gradually expanded into other areas, including aircraft insurance. The writing of a general insurance contract at Lloyd's does not constitute investment business for the purposes of the Bill, as the contracts concerned are not investments for the purposes of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a very few Lloyd's underwriters who underwrite long-term policies. Most of those policies are in specialised areas of life insurance. They are always written solely for the purposes of protection and not investment, and do not come within the definition of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the insurance business at Lloyd's is not of the sort that falls within schedule 1 and which is undertaken for investment purposes by the policyholder—nor should it be. It is indistinguishable from similar insurance contracts written for protection purposes by many insurance companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if Lloyd's insurance contracts as such were covered, one of the effects would be that members of Lloyd's would have to be authorised. That is because Lloyds members who write such contracts would be selling investments. I have always assumed that the aim of the Opposition in seeking to include Lloyd's is to protect the members, rather than to oblige them to become authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now return to the main point, which is to identify those activities at Lloyd's that fall within the scope of schedule 1. It is necessary, therefore, to describe a little of the way in which Lloyd's works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A member of Lloyd's does not underwrite insurance contracts on his own; indeed, the Lloyd's Act 1982 forbids him to do so. He must underwrite through an underwriting agent as part of a syndicate which consists of himself and a number— often hundreds—of other members. The underwriting agent manages the insurance business of the syndicate and decides which risks to underwrite on behalf of all the members of the syndicate, settles claims under the contracts already written and makes arrangements for re-insurance. He is given complete
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
discretion by the members to do that. When an underwriting agent acts in that capacity, he is called a managing agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, underwriting agents also act in another capacity. They assist people who wish to become members of Lloyd's and subsequently give them advice about which syndicates to join and which to leave. When they act for members in that way, they are called members' agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, when members receive premiums they are held on trust, subject to the terms of a premiums trust deed, which has to be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. That is important to protect the interests of policyholders; the trust prevents members' insurance funds being made available to their other creditors. In the insurance business, the premiums arrive first and the claims that have to be paid out of them follow. In the meantime, those premiums are invested, usually by an underwriting agent on behalf of the Lloyd's member. There are also various reserve funds for which part of the management is carried out by the Society of Lloyd's itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described three main activities which fall within the scope of schedule 1: the management on a collective basis by managing agents of the affairs of Lloyd's syndicates; the process of giving advice and assistance to members and potential members of Lloyd's by members' agents; and the investment management of members' insurance funds, usually carried out by underwriting agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 67 defines a collective investment scheme, the prototype for which is, as hon. Members will realise, a unit trust. However, the provisions of the clause are wider than conventional unit trusts and are designed to catch any arrangement for collective investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into details of clause 67 now, but the critical fact is that a Lloyd's syndicate falls within the definition of collective investment schemes. The affairs of the syndicate are handled on a collective basis, with the managing agents acting for a number—in some cases, a very large number—of names. Clause 67 provides contracts and protection on a wide-ranging basis for those who participate in collective investment schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make two related points, which may help hon. Members? First, the affairs of a syndicate at Lloyd's are covered by the schedule because they are conducted on a collective basis, not because contracts of insurance are, or are not, investments within the meaning of schedule 1. For example, the Bill does not cover forestry, but if a forestry scheme were to be run on a collective, commercial basis, that collective could fall within clause 67 and the relationship between the various participants and the people managing the scheme would fall to be regulated under the Bill. To achieve that result, it is not necessary to make trees investments within the meaning of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, hon. Members may be puzzled by clause 67(5)(g), which excludes contracts of insurance from the definition of collective investment, but I shall explain that. Unit trust schemes are the obvious
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
example of collective investment schemes. Over the years, one of the major developments in the insurance industry has been the development of unit-linked insurance policies, which in some ways closely resemble unit trusts, but which are fundamentally different in form since they are contracts of insurance. Insurance companies which issue them are regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry under the insurance companies' legislation and to regulate them both as insurance companies and as managers of collective investment schemes would be absurd. That is the reason for the exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contract of insurance between a name at Lloyd's and the policy-holder does not come under that definition of a collective investment scheme but the arrangements between managing agents and names for the conduct of the affairs of the syndicate do. The contract of insurance between the name at Lloyd's and the policy-holder does not come under that definition of a collective investment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 makes a unit in a collective investment scheme an investment. Units are defined in clause 67(7) as
	<br><q><p>"the rights or interests (however described) of the participants in a collective investment scheme".</p></q>
Paragraph 16 defines the
	<br><q><p>"Establishing, operating or winding up"</p></q>
of such a scheme as an investment business. In a Lloyd's syndicate, the managing agent is the operator, and his operation of it is the first of the activities that I described as being covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 defines units in a collective investment scheme as investments, so providing advice on such unite is included as investment business under paragraph 15. Thus the second activity at Lloyd's —the giving of advice about, and assistance with, syndicates by members' agents to members and potential members—? is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 14 covers Lloyd's third activity: the investment management of members' insurance funds, which is usually done by underwriting agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members that schedule 1 embraces the activities at Lloyd's that are appropriate to the Bill, and that it need not be amended to cover them. No doubt we shall debate whether Lloyd's should be exempted when we come to clause 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister; he has more than met my purpose in raising the point. His remarks will help us avoid unnecessary problems, which could arise before we reach clause 40. I agree with his reading of schedule 1 and the provisions of clause 67, which is why we have not tabled amendments to the schedule. It would help Committee members if he or his officials were to circulate a copy of his remarks before 	<i>Hansard</i> is published. We would then be able to look at them before the next sitting, if the debate continues beyond this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider it, although I departed from the prepared script—not that it may have looked like it. I did not affect its sense, but it will not coincide completely with 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brilliancy of the Minister's professionalism is such that we did not realise that he was extemporising. We should be content—admirable as the additional rhetorical flourishes no doubt were—with the written statement that he had in front of him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) may wish to comment, but I and my hon. Friends accept the Minister's distinction between insurance and investment business. It will help us when we come to clause 40 to have the sorts of investment business that the Bill includes firmly established, as the Minister has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 4.17(ii) of the White Paper " Financial Services in the United Kingdom " refers to
	<br><q><p>"making a new issue of its own shares or the purchase of its own shares by a company"</p></q>
as activities that would not require authorisation. Will my hon. and learned Friend confirm that they are excluded by paragraph 17 of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.17(vii) of the White Paper refers to
	<br><q><p>"the functions of insolvency practitioners."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
That reference has not found its way into the Bill. It is important that functions of insolvency practitioners should be excluded in the way that the White Paper describes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.17(H) of the White Paper proposes that" investments " should be defined to exclude
	<br><q><p>"a business … offered for sale as a single entity."</p></q>
That has not found its way into the Bill. I ask my hon. and learned Friend to deal with those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sale of a business or its assets as a single entity would not be defined as investment business in itself. However, if it were the shares in the company that were for sale, the Bill would cover a transfer agent whose business was the arrangement of such transactions. We are considering further that aspect of the matter.

My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will see that in clause 42(j).
