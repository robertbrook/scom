</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concluding my remarks at the end of our previous sitting to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) time to come back and lend her usual radiant charm and loveliness. That purpose has still not been achieved, though I guarantee that she will almost certainly feature on page 3 of our manifesto when it is written. I also wanted to allow time for the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) to do his usual departure trick—another purpose which I see has not been achieved. I shall allow a few more minutes for him to achieve that important social purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 351 gives powers to the SIB to deal with the plague of insider trading, which is such a blot on the escutcheon of the stock exchange and such an affront to the small investors we want to encourage into the market. This is part of a pattern of change that the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) are attempting to impose on the Bill, with the concurrence of the Opposition. It is important to strengthen the regulatory procedures and the power of a body which, thanks to the changes made in the Bill, now has greater authority, which should be supplemented by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We concur with that purpose. There is no difference of opinion on the role of competition, but there is on the role of regulation within that competition. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has rewritten Socialism in his book "Socialism mit Freiheit"—the product of many years' labour in the British Museum—without even a walk-on part for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
state. The problem is not the nature of competition— which is an element in all societies, capitalist or Socialist—but the regulation of that competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the Minister that the essence of statesmanship is to roll with the punches. The Minister still thinks that he is dealing with a different Bill from that emerging from the Committee. For the purposes of regulation, it would be better if he rolled with the punches and accepted the changes that have been made, to produce a Bill that is effective and acceptable to enlightened opinion within the City, as represented by the hon. Members for Chichester and for Beaconsfield. A far better Bill would emerge. As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said, we would not have to change it when we come to power after the next election. A less adequate Bill would force us to change the legislation, to pick up the pieces after the big bang. It would not be necessary to do that if the SIB had the proper powers and basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will roll with the punches and that his hon. Friends who are willing to wound but afraid to strike will also accept the inevitability of what is being done. I should like into the Bill to write a proper regulatory function for the City, not the first chapter of "Howard's End".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words about the point raised last week by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) on which I have been reflecting. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> It is a most important point, well worthy of reflection, and I am surprised that the Committee should consider it as a matter for anything other than congratulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said previously that it would be unreasonable and damaging to our markets to forbid authorised United Kingdom businesses from transacting any bargain where they could not ascertain the ultimate principal. There are many countries where shares are not registered and where law and custom take it for granted that the beneficial ownership of the company is unknown. An overseas bank may, with the best will in the world, be unable to discover the beneficial owners of the company for which it is acting, but that does not mean that the company is a front for wrongdoers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of companies formed in countries such as Switzerland and Belgium are formed by nationals of those countries for the pursuit of legitimate commercial objectives. If we refuse to do business with them unless their Governments, in effect, adopt British company law, we may frustrate a few insider dealers, but we shall also risk driving away millions of pounds of legitimate business. However, a different situation obtains where suspicion of insider dealing already exists, and where transactions in the weeks preceding an announcement are being looked into and disclosure is sought to identify a possible offender. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South that in that situation pressure should be applied to the fullest extent that proper limits of UK jurisdiction allow to obtain disclosure of the true principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such pressure could take the following forms. First, it could prohibit authorised United Kingdom firms from undertaking any further business with an offshore intermediary or counter party who refused to disclose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
the principals substantively behind the suspect transaction. Secondly, it could impose sanctions up to and including deauthorisation if the recalcitrant intermediary was authorised to carry on investment business in the United Kingdom. Such measures should be taken only with due regard to the possible limits to the knowledge of the persons from whom disclosure was sought. For example, it would be unreasonable to penalise a Swiss bank which was reasonably dealing when it knew no more of the Swiss company for which it had acted than that it was a wholly owned subsidiary of another company registered in the Netherlands Antilles, but it might be reasonable to penalise it when it could have known and chose not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is increasing recognition in the financially important countries that insider dealing is growing and there is readiness to collaborate in repressing it. The Government are playing an active part in following these efforts. Clause 149(6) is designed to enable the United Kingdom to disclose information in pursuance of any arrangements that result. I shall consider what additions to the Bill may be necessary to enable the pressures that I have mentioned to be exerted. Clause 60 already provides restriction orders and would allow prohibition to be placed on further dealings with specified persons; otherwise, it is a matter of ensuring that the designated agency and the self-regulating organisations have appropriate rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for those helpful remarks, but I should like to understand a little more clearly their practical implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that an authorised firm in this country has transacted business for a Swiss bank, that the dealings are the subject of suspicion and inquiry, and that the authorised person asks the Swiss bank to disclose the identity of the beneficial client behind the dealings. Is my hon. and learned Friend saying that if the Swiss bank, which is outside our jurisdiction in this matter, says to the authorised person, "This is a subsidiary of a company in another country and we cannot find out the information" that will constitute a refusal, not by the authorised person who has done his best to find out, but on the part of his ultimate client to disclose identity and under those circumstances we shall require the authorised person not to transact business for that account? Is that the implication in practical terms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be going a little far. It might depend upon whether it were reasonable, in the circumstances, for the Swiss bank to take the attitude identified by my hon. Friend. If, for instance, on the first occasion, the Swiss bank came back and said, "We've tried, but we've not been able to discover who is behind the transaction", the United Kingdom authorised business might say, "In that case, please do not transact with us any business in the future for that nominee", and the matter may be reasonably left there. But the kind of action to which I referred earlier might be appropriate, if, on future occasions, the Swiss bank disregarded that advice, and continued to act for that nominee and to refuse to make available information about who was behind the nominee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is also helpful. I want to be clear about the matter as I am anxious about how effective in practical terms those sanctions will be. It would at least be a measure of discouragement to the insider trader, if my hon. and learned Friend is saying that the authorised person could not find out at first attempt, but could reasonably ask his immediate client—in this case, the Swiss bank—not to pass business for that nominee account through the firm. As I understand it, if my hon. and learned Friend is saying that there is then evidence of repeated trading for that account, giving rise to suspicion, the powers to which he referred—which he intends to investigate with a view to incorporating in the legislation—might be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend. Those points are potentially significant in tackling the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), who has raised an important matter and elicited from the Minister some helpful remarks and a suggestion of a possible course of action that might alleviate the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the Minister's comments when he was talking hypothetically and said that appropriate action might take various forms. I fear that my attention might have wandered at the crucial moment, so perhaps the Minister would confirm that he would not simply rely on the existing provisions in the Bill— for example, clause 60—or on SIB's discretionary powers, but that he proposes to bring forward an amendment on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I would consider how best it could be done, if it were necessary to bring forward amendments to the Bill, to enable the powers to which I referred to be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I moved the amendment, perhaps I could wrap up the matter by saying briefly that I, like many of my hon. Friends, share the anxiety about the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments can only enhance the possibility of such situations being detected. The amendments only promote the prevention of insider training. I say that for one practical reason, apart from many symbolic reasons: SIB will have far more direct dealings than the stock exchange with investment banks and banks with investment divisions, which might be involved in transactions involving offshore funds and overseas institutions. Without the amendments, the Secretary of State and the stock exchange are, practically and effectively, exclusively responsible for watching those activities. That supervisory process will largely concern what happens in the stock exchange on a day-to-day basis. We are anxious that, in the new position that will arise, opportunities for dealing offshore and for insider trading conducted in various ways will extend well beyond the stock exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need, therefore, a body not just with a responsibility over the stock exchange, but with a broad remit in its discussions, dealings and day-to-day proximity to the market, to be aware that such situations might arise. In so doing, it can act only as a greater deterrent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
to the incidence of insider dealing than does the much more limited power in the clause. We are genuinely trying to promote the objectives that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary seeks, which can only advance prevention and detection of the instances described by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South. I hope that the amendments will commend themselves to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"(ff)</i> for the purpose of enabling or assisting the Deposit Protection Board to discharge its functions under that Act;"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Partly to facilitate the supervision of financial conglomerates, the Government aim to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
that statutory confidentiality restrictions do not unduly inhibit the disclosure of information between financial regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause already provides that the restriction in clause 148 on disclosure of certain information does not apply where disclosure would enable or assist the Bank of England to discharge its functions. The amendment widens this gateway for disclosure of information to enable or assist the Deposit Protection Board to discharge its functions under the Banking Act 1979. Those functions relate to maintaining a fund for making payments to depositors when a recognised bank or licensed institution becomes insolvent. The board is not obliged to make payment to a person whom it considers was responsible for the financial difficulties of the institution or has profited from them. That is why information might be of value to the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 365, in page 112, line 16, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>"(hh)</i> or the purpose of enabling or assisting the Insurance Brokers Registration Council to discharge its functions under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977.".</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to the Minister for adding his name to the amendment. Its purpose is to enable the Insurance Brokers Registration Council to share information with other regulatory bodies, and reciprocally to share information provided by other bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 112, line 35, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in the public interest".</p></blockquote>
I sympathise with the worries of the banking community about this phrase in subsection (2). It would allow confidential information obtained from a bank for supervisory purposes, including information about the bank's customers, to be divulged to Government Departments without the consent of the people concerned, whenever to do so was deemed to be in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause accords with Government proposals for the forthcoming banking legislation, but that does not make it more acceptable to those who have expressed concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bank customers, whether depositors, borrowers or users of the bank's investment services, are reasonably entitled to expect their affairs to be kept secret, unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary. The more hands that confidential information passes through, the greater is the danger of a leak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The banks are worried that overseas customers, many of whom are from countries where the secrecy requirements are stricter, may take fright at the possibility of their affairs being disclosed and business may be lost as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection to the exchange of confidential information between supervisory authorities to enable them to carry out their supervisory functions. Nor could there be any objection to disclosure in the interests of the depositors or investors. However, the concept of the public interest seems vague. If such a wide power is needed, will the Minister spell out the circumstances in which it might be used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would make it a criminal offence for a regulatory authority to disclose restricted information to the Secretary of State or the Treasury in certain cases, even if it was in the public interest for such disclosure to be made. Grounds for such disclosure would be limited to the interests of investors or to other disclosure gateways in clause 149. The amendment is not acceptable to the Government, although I have some sympathy with the considerations that led my hon. Friend to table it. I hope to reassure him on the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision in the Bill parallels analogous provisions in the Building Societies Bill and the forthcoming banking Bill, as foreshadowed in the Government's White Paper on banking supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to answer my hon. Friend's question, but exceptional cases will inevitably arise out of, or related to, the affairs of financial institutions, which go beyond the interests of investors to the wider public interest. The Government have a responsibility in such cases. Therefore, those in possession of information must be able to disclose it to the responsible Government Department without fear of criminal penalties. That has been the experience under banking legislation.

As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury said in the context of building societies, the Government would expect that power of disclosure to be used only extremely occasionally. However, it is right that in the public interest, Government Departments should know of what could be serious matters affecting their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if information were to light on financial institutions in Wales which should be brought to the attention of the Secretary of State for Wales because of its wide implications for the public interest, that would be the kind of exceptional case where disclosure would be important and desirable. I am sorry that I cannot be more precise. However, the provisions of the clause cater for that kind of case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend. But to my knowledge, Wales is not a country where secrecy is of paramount importance.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I could go further than to express it in general terms. Financial information, which could have implications far beyond the purely financial realm, could become available. That could directly affect general responsibilities which the Secretary of State for Wales might have to discharge. He would have to have that information so that he could better discharge those responsibilities. That is an understandable principle; however, it would be difficult—and perhaps undesirable—to cite examples that are too specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am entirely happy about what my hon. and learned Friend has said.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The growth of international financial conglomerates and the increasing internationalisation of financial business makes it essential that regulators in different countries can be given each other's information in appropriate cases. Clause 149(6) removes the restriction in clause 148 on the disclosure of certain information, where the purpose of the disclosure would be to enable certain overseas regulators to discharge their functions. The first amendment extends that to assisting the discharge of those functions. There could be cases where it would be possible for the regulator to discharge its functions, perhaps by relying on its own information, but where the disclosure would make the task easier. Such widening of the disclosure gateway would bring the wording of clause 149(6) into line with the wording in clause 149(1) dealing with domestic regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment provides a new gateway for disclosure which would enable—or assist—an overseas authority to discharge functions corresponding to those of the Bank of England under the Banking Act 1979. It would therefore be possible to export information obtained under the Bill where it is relevant to overseas banking authorities, as well as to overseas authorities involved with investment, insurance listing and insider dealing. Such disclosure, as in the case of any other disclosure, is of course discretionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that the Secretary of State is satisfied that confidentiality will be effectively preserved and that there is full reciprocity in the disclosure of information by the country or territory concerned to the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to add a proviso to subsection (6) which is a delightfully naive little subsection. Although it refers to subsection 148, I think that it must mean section 148 and the Government may wish to put forward an amendment on that point. However, subsection (6) states that the provision
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not preclude the disclosure of information for the purpose of enabling an authority in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom to exercise functions corresponding to those of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
What does "corresponding" mean in those circumstances? Much sensitive information about the affairs of investment businesses will be in the hands of the Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulating organisations. What protection will there be for them? Should there not be a proviso, along the lines of the amendment, that where information is to be passed to authorities exercising functions corresponding to those of the Secretary of State, confidentiality is to be preserved and there is to be full reciprocity? Otherwise, investment businesses in this country could be placed at a competitive disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the amendment of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), at least so far as it deals with reciprocity. It is perhaps unnecessary, or unusual, to try to write into the Bill a requirement for reciprocity. It presages a dog in the manger attitude in circumstances in which reciprocity would not be available, and that would not be an appropriate attitude for us to take. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to direct the attention of his hon. and learned Friend to the need for reciprocity. The Minister may have intended to talk about this anyway, but I hope that he will tell us about the efforts that I imagine he is making to reach agreements with some of the major countries on a joint approach to some of the problems and on how reciprocity can become a practical reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is an important one, and I have no doubt that both the matters to which he referred—the preservation of confidentiality and reciprocity—would not only be taken into account, but would weigh very heavily, in the discretionary exercise of the power to exchange information that this subsection provides. I emphasise that it is to be discretionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To write those points into the clause in the manner suggested by my hon. Friend would create practical problems. It would not be easy for the Secretary of State to be absolutely satisfied that there would be full reciprocity in the disclosure of information between the overseas country and the United Kingdom, and it would be difficult to judge whether recriprocity was operating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confidentiality would create practical problems because the Secretary of State is not the only person who may take advantage of this clause. The designated agency—or a recognised body that had received information from the agency—would have to clear any intended disclosure with the Secretary of State under this amendment, to ensure that confidentiality was maintained. The overseas authority would presumably be unable to disclose information to anyone else, even though that might be essential to the discharge of its functions. The United Kingdom information may suggest that an overseas company was unfit to carry on business overseas, but if the authority were barred from any further disclosure, it would be unable to produce the information as part of its case for action against the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are important, and would doubtless be fully taken into account in the exercise of any discretion to disclose and exchange information with overseas regulators, but it would be undesirable for them to be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, I understand that the reference to "subsection" instead of "section" can be corrected as a printing error, without the necessity for an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), we are exploring with the SEC in the United States the possibility of an agreement that would promote cooperation and disclosure of
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
information in both directions, and I raised the matter with the American authorities when I was in the United States in November. They responded positively and I am optimistic that we can reach such an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are interested in exploring similar arrangements with other countries, and we have already held preliminary discussions with our partners in the European Community. The Council of Europe is also looking at the possibility of cooperation on insider dealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 113, line 41, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any person who engages solely in activities falling within subsection (3)(a) below shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as carrying on investment business.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Activities carried out in the capacity of a trustee (other than a pensioner trustee) of a small self-administered pension scheme being a pension scheme in which the Board of Inland Revenue has required the appointment of a pensioner trustee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>For the purpose of this subsection, a pensioner trustee is a person or body who satisfies such conditions as the Board of Inland Revenue shall from time to time determine in connection with the approval under the Finance Act 1970 of self-administered pension schemes with fewer than twelve members.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment recognises the difficulty that the clause may create for small, self-administered pension schemes. Such schemes normally have fewer than 12 members, and frequently only one or two. The members are the shareholders and the directors of the company that establishes the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest, as I was, and still may be, a beneficiary of some such scheme, set up long before I began my parliamentary career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The members of a scheme are the main influence on its investment policy, and the companies are usually family businesses or businesses with a small number of shareholders. There are several thousand such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The superannuation funds office of the Inland Revenue insists that such schemes should have a pensioneer trustee, which can be a corporate trustee. Pensioneer trustees are widely involved in pension matters in a professional capacity and they have to be approved by the superannuation funds office. Therefore, all the small, self-administered pension schemes have, in the form of a pensioneer trustee, an expert among their trustees, but they differ from large pension schemes in that the members are, in effect, investing their own money on their own behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 150 would require all the trustees, not just the pensioneer trustees, to be authorised persons. That would be a cumbersome process, involving a tremendous number of applications from people who do not wish to carry out investment business in any other role than as a trustee of a small, self-administered pension scheme. That process is especially unnecessary as each scheme has a pensioneer trustee who will be authorised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I explain briefly why the clause is in the Bill. The Government believe that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
members of a pension scheme are, in effect, investors in that scheme and that they deserve the protection that the Bill will extend to investors. Many pension schemes, both personal and occupational, would be covered by the Bill without the clause. The clause ensures that members of in-house managed schemes—that is, schemes in which the assets are managed either by trustees or by an employee of the company concerned—are also entitled to the protection that the Bill affords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a number of representations that suggest that the clause is not quite right. I am considering those representations carefully and will bring forward whatever amendments may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) that small, self-adminstered pension schemes should not be discouraged. I also agree that, where such a scheme had a pensioneer trustee who manages the scheme's assets, the desired object could probably be achieved by requiring only the pensioneer trustee to be authorised. However, although many pensioneer trustees offer a professional management service, not all do and they are not required to do so. Their only formal duty is to prevent the winding up of a scheme in circumstances that would abuse the tax advantages that it enjoys. It is therefore quite possible that some or all of the non-pensioneer trustees of a small, self-administered scheme could themselves manage the scheme's assets. I am not convinced that in such a case it would be right to exclude the non-pensioneer trustees from the need to be authorised. However, we are considering carefully the scope of the clause and I will bear my hon. Friend's arguments in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was uncertain, Sir Michael, whether to raise this point now or on clause stand part, but since the Minister said that he is unhappy with the drafting of the clause I should like to raise a wider issue that springs from the amendment of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the trustees manage funds to some extent. In fact, many regard that as the reason why they are appointed, and there is possible ambiguity in the definitions here. We know that there are high-profile trustees, like Mr. Arthur Scargill, who would not want investments to be made in South Africa or oil and so on, but normally trustees appoint a fund manager and discuss the investments with him from time to time, and the trustees may influence decisions about investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 20 of schedule 1 shows clearly and in general terms how a manager should be defined: someone who holds himself out as offering management services, and who is paid for those in addition to the payment that he receives as a general trustee. However, any trustee may regard himself as offering certain facilities for managing trusts in an appropriate and proper fashion. Moreover, how are we to define the additional sum paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried by the departmental note on clause 150, although I must say in passing how helpful the notes on clauses have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the note for clause 150 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of the clause is that any person, including a trustee of an occupational pension scheme, will be required to be authorised
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
(even if—as a trustee—he would otherwise benefit from the exclusion in paragraph 20 of Schedule 1) if he himself manages the assets of the scheme."</p></blockquote>
The definition of management, there is ambiguous and it may force trustees to seek authorisation when it would not have been necessary nor, indeed, have been the Minister's intention that they should do so. If they have to seek authorisation, it is likely that worker trustees and other desirable trustees of a pension fund would not reach the standards of competence and professional ability required elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be satisfied if the Minister will undertake to consider these definitions when redrafting the clause. I fear that the ambiguity may disqualify from the position of trustees worker trustees of pension funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) that we are considering the matters he has raised in deciding what amendments to make to clause 150. We are seeking to ensure that trustees of the kind he mentioned, who take only strategic decisions on investment of funds, will not have to be authorised, but that people undertaking detailed investment management must. We have that distinction in mind and are seeking how best to achieve it in the new drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the reply of my hon. and learned Friend, which I hope will reassure those who feel that an excessive number of potential trustees will have to seek authorisation.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say a word on how the provisions of clause 151 relate to our obligations under the EEC treaties? I imagine that it is not envisaged that in practice those powers will be exercised against a country belonging to the EEC, but will the Minister explain how the clause will work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it simply assumed that every EEC member state will comply with its own treaty obligations and so provide British firms with the same conditions that are obtainable here? If that does not happen in practice, is it intended to use the remedy provided by clause 151, or would the Government pursue remedies through Community law and through EEC institutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause lies uneasily in the Bill. It has nothing to do with investor protection and it flies in the face of much of what the Government profess to stand for in encouraging a free and open market. The clause will not enhance the other provisions or the overall quality of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause empowers the Secretary of State to disqualify or to restrict the authorisation of firms from any country which, in his opinion does not offer United Kingdom firms the ability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to carry on investment, insurance or banking business … on terms as favourable as"</p></blockquote>
those which firms from that country enjoy in the United Kingdom. The clause is anti-competitive, protectionist and inequitable and will be capricious in its impact. It flies in the face of what I understand to be Conservative party attitudes towards the way in which the City should be allowed to operate and it will be detrimental to employment in the companies affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that political or economic sanctions have been effective. In my view, the threatened sanctions in the clause will not have any demonstrable impact on the company law of the countries concerned or on the discretionary basis on which they operate their investment or banking markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are informed that the Secretary of State intends to operate the provision as a reserve power. I understand that there is no general requirement to have regard to reciprocity before authorising a business. However, the discretionary nature of the power means that it can be used selectively where its use is likely to assist the interests of British firms which would otherwise be unable to compete on fair terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to learn what examples my hon. and learned Friend has in mind. Many commentators on and observers of such matters feel that the clause is unnecessary and that it should play no part in the Bill. When the Bill was first published the leading article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> plucked out the clause as one that should find no place in legislation that was designed primarily to protect the interests of investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the clause goes well beyond investment and insurance business and impacts on banking business—a deposit-taking business in itself. The clause seems to reflect some feeling of inadequacy in the current sanctions and control available to the governor of the Bank of England over companies here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would argue that we already have an effective range of sanctions, especially in the banking sector. For example, certain foreign owned or international companies cannot obtain recognition under the Banking Act 1979. Even though the Act is being reviewed, that sanction has enabled the Secretary of State and the governor of the Bank of England to adopt a qualitative approach towards individual companies. We can all think of substantial banking companies in the City that would have liked full recognition under that Act but were unable to receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several ways in which the Bank of England has effectively been able to spike the guns of some of the largest financial and investment concerns internationally. I suspect that that is partly through concern about how they would be accountable and supervised within the London market, but also possibly it is a means of ensuring that our own investment and banking businesses were accorded the same rights elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking particularly of companies such as Nomura Securities, one of the largest investment concerns in the world and one of the most successful Japanese companies. It had and has great difficulty in being recognised officially in the City and thus be able to take deposits, although an essential part of an investment business of such a global nature is to manage the liquid funds under its control. As it was not initially
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
a recognised deposit taker—though it was one of the largest investment broking businesses in the world—it fell foul of a technicality of recognition which inhibited it from carrying on its full business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That restriction may have been invoked for thoroughly good reasons. I suspect that the governor feels that he has less control over the activities of such foreign-owned companies than he does over British registered companies and banks. However, a range of sanctions and effective restrictions can be invoked as a much more discretionary and informal method of control than the implanting in law of a draconian and threatening power for the Secretary of State and the Treasury to deauthorise particular foreign-owned concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about how the power might be used. If my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary seeks to argue that it is a reserve power which we do not intend to use, I shall suggest that we should not legislate for it. The clause gives the Secretary of State or the Treasury an untrammelled right to interrupt the wholly legitimate business interests of foreign-owned, or partly foreign-owned companies here. Although there may be some lack of reciprocity in the country concerned, it may not amount to a felony or necessitate a substantial inhibition on the conduct of business in that country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. Some recent proposed changes in Canadian federal law will alter arrangements beneficially for British financial businesses. However, till now the law in Canada on banking and insurance businesses has been both prejudicial and differential with regard to foreign concerns. Insurance and banking businesses have to retain a certain proportion of assets and investments in Candian companies, whereas Canadian businesses conducting the same business have no such restraint. There are different reserve asset requirements on foreign-owned banks and nationally-owned banks in Canada. It could be argued that that would offer less advantageous access to those markets for foreign-owned banks, but it would not amount to a sufficiently serious inhibition on the market for my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State to invoke the powers of the clause and put the Royal Bank of Canada out of business overnight. However, he may feel that certain countries are acting in a way that is wholly prejudicial to British companies and are denying them sufficient access, leading him to exercise the draconian powers in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to ask my honourable and learned Friend about the impact on contract law of the apparent retroactivity of the provision in clause 151(4), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a disqualification notice shall have the effect of
	<ol>
	<li>cancelling any authorisation of the person concerned to carry on the business to which the notice relates; and</li>
	<li>disqualifying him from becoming authorised to carry on that business".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that that disqualification order shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"have the effect of restricting any authorisation of that person in respect of that business to the performance of contracts entered into before the notice comes into force."</p></blockquote>
If I have read the subsection correctly, I do not understand why it is equitable or desirable that, in the case of a company carrying on a legitimate, fully authorized
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
business, perhaps employing many British people, which enters into a simple contract for the purchase or sale of shares with a British client, the invocation of the clause might nullify all the contracts entered into before that disqualification order came into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable and learned Friend is shaking his head, so I shall say no more. Perhaps it is easy to disabuse me of my fears in that respect, as I may have misunderstood the subsection. I hope so, because it appears to contain an element of retroactivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wish to know whether the definition of a person connected with a country, in clause 151(10), includes a body corporate which is a United Kingdom limited and registered subsidiary of a foreign bank. I understand why a branch bank of a Japanese company, for example, might be set up to bear the full blast of the impact of the clause, if Japan, in the Secretary of State's opinion, does not accord equivalence of access to its market. But is the position different where a registered United Kingdom company is involved? Furthermore, is the position different if that United Kingdom company is partly rather than wholly owned abroad and there are minority interests in the company which are owned by others, for example, United Kingdom nationals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what is the position with regard to consortium concerns, both banking and investment? My honourable and learned Friend is aware that in recent years and probably increasingly in the future, given the need for financial muscle power many institutions operating in those markets are consortium banks, with substantial shareholdings from various countries. If that is so, how are they to suffer, or will they be exempt? If they are to be exempt because, let us say, Nomura Securities owns 50 per cent of the company and the Royal Bank of Canada owns the other 50 per cent, how is it fair and equitable to allow them to continue to operate in the market, whereas another wholly owned Japanese bank or investment concern may fall foul of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about those provisions because they do not seem to have been fully thought through. They will be capricious and inequitable. Those concerns employ not only a large, but a growing number of British people and, for those reasons, the clause should have no place in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) has raised a number of important points. I do not go all the way with him in his analysis, but I am reluctant to see the clause stand part of the Bill. It is explicitly protectionist and we should be mindful of the damage that protectionism has done and might yet do. In the 1930s, in the face of major difficulties in financial markets, governments acting, as they thought, practically and rationally in the national self-interest, embarked on a chain of mutually retaliatory protectionist measures, which plunged the world into depression, with appalling economic, social and political consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
a consequence of going off the gold standard, meant that unemployment was halved between 1931 and 1936. Our economy grew faster than any competing economy, even faster than Nazi Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is common sense that if markets are closed down, the volume of economic activity is reduced. Those policies are prejudicial to employment. We can look at interacting circumstances and causes of economic development at any one moment, but there are enough lessons of history to demonstrate that protectionism is a dangerous policy and not in the interests of employment. Fortified by historical memory and faced in 1979 with the worst recession in world trade since the 1930s, Governments have been much more prudent and resisted protectionism. Our Government have played a notable and commendable part in the argument against protectionism in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and at economic summits. Their good credentials in relation to protectionism should be taken into account in assessing the Government's reason for introducing the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protectionist practices are widespread, not least in the financial services industry. Other countries have laws and administrative procedures restricting access to their financial services markets. Therefore, it is fair and legitimate in the national interest that our Government should take account of the access available to United Kingdom businesses in other financial market places in the world when considering what access should be permitted to foreign businesses in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is couched in general terms. Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend will be less coy in what he tells the Committee. What countries and what practices does he have in mind? Is he thinking of the restriction on access to the insurance market which the Germans, French, Danes and Irish have imposed? The opinion in the European Court of Justice last week on the case brought by the Commission is encouraging, although it does not relate to life assurance. However, it is a warning shot against protectionist practices in the insurance area within the European Community and should be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. and learned Friend thinking of the United States? We are aware of the protectionist policies on steel and agriculture matched by the protectionism of the European Economic Community in those two areas. But does he also have in mind protectionist restrictions on access by our business to American financial services markets?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend is also thinking of Japan, which has been all too slow to open up its markets. There are too many accounts of British firms engaged in interminable negotiations, culminating in frustration, in their attempts to enter those markets. I understand that more than 50 Japanese subisidiaries are authorised to deal in the securities markets in London, whereas no more then eight London firms have securities branch licences in Japan. Our stock exchange is opening up participation to major foreign securities firms, such as Nomura Securities, to enable such firms to play an appropriate part in the governing of the London stock exchange. However, access to the Tokyo stock exchange is much more difficult and expensive.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Therefore, we have a long way to go to achieve stock exchange reciprocity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, the picture is more encouraging on a broader front, and we should welcome the constructive and responsible part played by the Japanese after the Plaza accord, in moving towards a co-ordinated interest and exchange rates policy. As a result, the yen has been substantially revalued, which should take much of the pressure for protectionism out of the system. It is only appropriate that Japan should, although belatedly, have played that part, as it is enormously powerful: its surplus on the trading account in 1985 was, I think, greater than the peak surplus of Saudi Arabia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increasing number of joint projects in the developing world is also encouraging. For example, Balfour Beatty participated with Japanese interests in Sri Lanka.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no prospect under present circumstances of the clause being implemented against the Japanese, but, sadly, experience demonstrates that it is wise for the Government to take a reserve power of that sort. As I understand it, the Government have incorporated the clause to strengthen their arm in negotiating the liberalisation of international financial service markets. On that basis, I support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the remainder of the debate will not develop into a free trade versus protectionism argument. That is not the basis of the clause, which deals with detail and should not lead to a general discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over far too broad an area of policy it is thought throughout the country that in international competitive relations we fight with one arm tied behind our back while others use both and that we play cricket while others play many nefarious games of which we know little. If there was one thing about which I was determined when I was asked to join the Government seven months ago, it was that that would not be the case in any areas for which I had responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one examines the matter in detail, one finds that in most cases the popular perception is misplaced and that the playing field is more level than many people suppose. However, one has only to read a list of the countries that have a repricocity provision for financial services in their law to see how essential it is that we are not deprived of such a weapon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not respond in detail to the question about the use that may or may not be made of the power, nor shall I deal with specific countries in the way in which I have been invited to do. I shall merely recite a list: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not until I have finished the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us what it is about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into detail: I shall not identify the provision that each country has made. The list is necessarily incomplete, but it is sufficiently
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
extensive to make it clear how necessary it is that we should not deprive ourselves of such a power, which can be used in negotiations with other countries to ensure that our financial institutions and businesses that wish to carry on business in those countries and to take advantage of access to those markets should not be deprived unfairly and unilaterally of such access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the clause is a reserve power; we hope that by using it effectively in negotiations we shall never need to operate it, but if we fail in those negotiations and it becomes clear that we are not being given fair access to the markets of any other country and that other countries are taking advantage of access to our markets but are denying access unfairly to our businesses, we shall not hesitate to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background I shall deal with the specific points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). He said that it would be unfortunate if any retrospective effect were given to a disqualification notice under subsection (4). My reading of the clause is that it is drafted to ensure that it does not have a retrospective effect on contracts, as my hon. Friend feared. The wording is that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"restriction notice shall… have the effect of restricting any authorisation of that person in respect of that business to the performance of contracts entered into before the notice comes into force."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, contracts that were entered into before the notice comes into force would not have their validity affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) may wish to put this point himself, but he wanted to know whether a disqualification order was similarly restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In so far as a disqualification order itself may go wider than the point to which I have referred, its effect would be taken into account in making the order. I imagine that careful consideration would be given to that particular consequence when such an order was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will agree that this is an important point. So that it is absolutely clear, will he confirm that where a company has a disqualification notice served on it, for example on 31 December, and at that time it has several legitimate contracts with clients who have bought and sold shares, it cannot itself perform any of those contracts entered into before that date? Surely that is a retrospective impact on a wholly legitimate and freely entered-into legal contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true of the disqualification notice but not of the restriction notice, on the basis of the distinction that is made in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for the fact that the powers that are provided in the clause are draconian; they are intended to be draconian powers. Of course, the width of the powers themselves and the implications of any exercise of them are all matters that will be carefully taken into account in any such exercise. It it ever comes to the exercise of such powers, they can be limited in their impact to take account of anxieties that my hon. Friend has outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsidiary companies registered in the United Kingdom are dealt with in subsection (10), which makes it plain that if such subsidiaries were controlled by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>919</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person or persons connected with that country"</p></blockquote>
against whom exercise of the reciprocal measures was directed, they would come fairly and squarely within the clause. The same would apply to consortium concerns. The criterion would be whether such a body was controlled from the country at which the exercise of the power was directed. That would be determined on the basis of the definition of controller in clause 162(3). If the need arises, effective action can be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If negotiations for full reciprocal access for United Kingdom financial businesses are not successful, clause 151 will be available, but we hope that it will not have to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of European Community obligations, and because clause 151 refers to any country outside the UK and therefore includes fellow member states, will not part of the process of ensuring proper reciprocity of obligations—with which I agree—also be enforced under the Treaty of Rome? We have to assume that fellow member states will not inhibit the rules of the Treaty of Rome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will action be taken under article 169 of the treaty through the Court of Justice to ensure that where a member state is in breach of its obligations it complies with those obligations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has the advantage over me in recalling the precise article of the Treaty of Rome that identifies the power that he described. If it is appropriate to use the power in article 169, we shall not hesitate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In comnsidering the exercise of the powers in clause 151 towards our partners in the Community, to which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred, we shall have to have regard to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and to our obligations to the Community, and those will undoubtedly temper the way that the powers in the clause will be exercised towards those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite some initial doubts, my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) has come to recognise the need for clause 151, and I feel that we should not deprive ourselves of this important power, and therefore I commened the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened open-mounted with surprise and admiration to the Minister's robust statement on clause 151. He appears to endorse a series of draconian powers, as was elicited by his hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), on the ambit of the retrospective effect of a disqualification order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was fascinated also by the Minister's revelation, which was new to me, that it is not only the appointment of his hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) as Minister of State with responsibility for trade that is undermining the free trade theology that has until now prevailed in the DTI. I am delighted to recognise another convert to the cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having expressed himself with such fervour and determination, will the Minister, in conjunction with his hon. Friend the Member for Sutton, soon be sponsoring a Bill with some such title as the Fair Trading
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
Bill, in which the principles of clause 151 are extended to trade in goods, and to trade in manufactured goods in particular? Short of introducing such a measure, perhaps the Minister would consider tabling an amendment to clause 151 whereby the principle of the clause, and the sanctions there implied, would extend not only to a failure to provide receiprocity in financial services, but to any failure, or any problems of unfair trading. That might be even more effective in carrying through the Minister's obviously heartfelt wishes on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition were delighted to hear the robust endorsement of such principles and look forward to further developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do however hesitate over the relationship between clause 151 and our EEC obligations. Our EEC partners figured largely on the list the Minister read, yet he said that the clause will not be called into play in respect of them. As the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) suggested, we may have to rely on the trusty remedies provided by the Treaty of Rome, to which we have had to have recourse so often in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On how many occasions over the past 13 years have we taken advantage of the provisions of the treaty and recourse to the European Court to secure the repricocity that the Minister so enthusiastically endorses? The Minister is entitled to reply that my party was in Government for part of that period. While I welcome his defence of clause 151, and while I look forward to seeing its projection into other areas of trade, does the Minister, faced with the acid test of our relations with the EEC, mean to convert his words into serious action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to my honourable and learned Friend and noticed that he twice used the phrase "would not hesitate" to use the powers under certain circumstances. Surely he would always hesitate before using them. The use of the powers should be reserved as a last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that under clause 151 we could be pushed into a position where we are seen always to require reciprocity. The powers are important and valuable, but they should not always be used. I can envisage circumstances where a certain country does not have reciprocal access for British companies, but whose nationals form such an important part of our own market that it would be contrary to our national interest to exclude them from participation. What are my learned Friend's views?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond first to the last question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill)? The powers under the clause will be discretionary and will enable all the matters to which he referred to be taken into account. He is right to say that they should be used only as a last resort, and after careful consideration. Thereafter, one should not hesitate. There is nothing between my hon. Friend and myself there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) must know that we look forward to the next round of talks in GATT which will take place in the imminent future. The ministerial responsibility for those talks will be in the hands of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) and no doubt that fact gives great reassurance to the hon. Gentleman.

In cases now before the European court we had only last week an encouraging opinion from the Advocate General on the extent to which the insurance industry in Germany and other countries should be opened for access Community-wide. If the Commission is pursuing those matters in a helpful way, there is no need for the Government to take advantage of the treaty article referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).

I am sure that the Committee will be interested to know that while we were engaged in passionate debate on reciprocity, a French bus hit the rear of my car, which was in Parliament Square.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has shown an interesting division on Conservative Benches. We see the wimps versus the winners. The winners are the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) who have advanced arguments and pursued them with courage and independence necessary for success. They had the courage of their convictions and voted for their beliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wimps, who include the hon. Members for Suffolk South (Mr. Yeo), for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. MrCrindle), for Stafford (Mr. Cash)—the Uriah Heep of financial services—for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), also put the views of outside organisations and pressure groups. They spoke with nominal courage but lacked the determination to back their arguments with their votes. In the end they abjectly submitted to whatever the Minister cared to dole out to them, which in most instances was very little. The difference in approach is well worth mentioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in my astounding-offer speech I shall offer the wimps an opportunity. Although I normally concur with the winners, who have been advancing very sensible views, here I do not agree with the hon. Member for Chichester. I am disappointed by his assumption that if powers are abandoned, good will automatically follows, and that others will play the game so we do not need the reserve powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like everyone else, the Minister attempted to have it both ways. He began with a ringing evocation of poor, abject little Britain, maltreated by everyone else. He said that we played the game while others did not, but added that the picture was more even-handed than we believed and that the powers might not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester argued both ways by saying that existing powers were exercised sensibly by the Bank of England so we did not need any in the legislation. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon began his circular argument by opposing the powers but ended by supporting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difference in Conservative philosophy is emerging from the Government Benches. Conservative philosophy is not to have such powers, to let the law of the jungle prevail and to lay the country open to rape, exploitation and domination whenever possible. That philosophy was adopted on oil where it is manifested by a lack of powers over the oil industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
If such a tenet is central to Conservative Members' philosophy we shall offer them an opportunity. If, as I hope, the debate ends in a Division we shall support the Minister's courage and determination to help British interests and allow the wimps a free ride. They can demonstrate some courage by voting against the Government in support of Conservative philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as the acceptance of that deposit is regulated by rules established under this Act.".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister can tell me immediately that the object of the amendment is already met by the wording of the clause. My concern is that the exception created may be rather wide. I seek to ensure that the taking of a deposit, if not regulated under the Banking Act 1979 or successor legislation, is regulated by rules made under the Bill. I ask for an assurance that there is no gap between two sets of provisions through which the business of taking a deposit may slip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary. All deposits accepted in the course of investment business are intended to be subject to clients' money regulations under clause 50. If an authorised person were to accept deposits otherwise than in accordance with those regulations, anyone who suffered loss as a result would have a remedy. The clause as drafted does what the hon. Gentleman seeks to ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I believe that an exemption of the type contained in the clause is needed, I am considering whether the Bill should contain provision for this or whether the matter should be dealt with in an exempt transactions order under section 2 of the Banking Act.

	<br><blockquote><p>"or the Securities and Investments Board".</p></blockquote>
This is another modest amendment from the stable of Chichester and Beaconsfield which seeks slightly to extend the ambit of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that all offences, other than those under clause 114, may be prosecuted only by the Secretary of State, Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. The amendment seeks to extend that power to the SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with previous debates on the powers of investigation and the effectiveness of the SIB, the argument advanced by my hon. and learned Friend against building on those already accorded in the Bill is that the power is not appropriate for a private sector regulatory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the SIB is a statutorily recognised body, and we hope that it will be for a long time. Therefore, not only is it capable of exercising the powers of prosecution, but it should be given such powers. Those powers would have been helped if the previous group of amendments on insider dealing had been accepted, but, nevertheless, SIB will have considerable responsibilities under the Bill, and will be charged with the responsibility not only of overseeing and authorising concerns, but of investigating some of their activities. It is anomalous that it will then be denied the opportunity to take the full range of action against the businesses involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under delegation, SIB will be able to wield a number of sanctions against those who offend the provisions of the Bill, but, unlike the Secretary of State, it will not be able to prosecute. I believe that it should be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to read recent reports, with a direct bearing on the issue, of the Government's consideration
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
of the establishment of an independent body with powers of prosecution in some financial matters. 	<i>The Times</i> stated yesterday that the Government are thinking of setting up
	<br><blockquote><p>"A high-powered organization charged with the detection, investigation and prosecution of serious fraud"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"an inter-departmental government committee, which is likely to report soon after Easter"</p></blockquote>
has been established. The report continues that the committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"is thought likely to recommend the unified organization",</p></blockquote>
which could combat fraud more effectively than those who have been responsible for investigating and prosecuting it hitherto. The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This would combine the resources of the various agencies that at present handle fraud cases; the police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the companies inspectorate of the Department of Trade and Industry and the revenue departments of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
We are told that the organisation
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be staffed by lawyers, accountants and investigation officers, all trained in the appropriate skills."</p></blockquote>
It appears that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Key ministers with departmental responsibilities accept Lord Roskill's arguments that such an organization would allow fewer serious frauds to escape prosecution".</p></blockquote>
Those Ministers
	<br><blockquote><p>"believe it would lead to more effective prosecution, with scope for reducing delays in bringing cases to trial. Ministers see practical difficulties in bringing together organizations that have traditionally worked separately but believe they are surmountable. The proposal is known to have backing within the DTI, the Treasury and among the Government's law officers."</p></blockquote>
If those reports are true and, as I and many other people would welcome, the Government are taking serious action to investigate more effectively and prosecute more cases of fraud, by setting up an independent body and giving it powers of prosecution, are we to take the provisions of the Bill and the powers and responsibilities of the SIB less seriously than the cases of fraud? Indeed, many activities that will fall foul of the Bill are fraudulent or, if they are not, they are at least as serious as fraud and many are criminal offences. Why are we denying SIB that power, if we are taking fraud seriously and considering setting up a body to investigate and prosecute such cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that matter, because the article in 	<i>The Times</i> raised a few eyebrows. Before we debate the amendment in depth, perhaps the Minister will give us the status of that article. Is it derived from a press briefing that he or his officials gave? We should know more about it before voting on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously a matter for my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, under clause 96, SIB may take action to investigate persons by means of powers conferred under clauses 92 and 93 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person who without reasonable excuse fails to comply with a requirement imposed on him under this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding the fifth level on the standard scale or to both."</p></blockquote>
In that instance, where the powers are delegated to the Securities and Investments Board it can conduct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
investigations and call for papers and for persons to appear before it. If a person fails to comply with those investigatory powers, a criminal offence will have been committed. But at that stage there is nothing that SIB can do. It must go to the Secretary of State and say that those people have been naughty boys and that the Department must use its powers to prosecute under the Act. That does not give SIB the authority, independence or effectiveness that it is entitled to demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in clause 93 the Secretary of State can effectively delegate a wide range of investigatory powers to anyone, which in practice may be an official of the Securities and Investments Board. But, again, his wings will be clipped because the Secretary of State reserves unto himself the power of prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, when we come to a new clause that seeks to give the Securities and Investments Board the power to look into unauthorised businesses, strong arguments will be made for SIB to carry through such powers and to prosecute. Many people will not take the provisions of the Bill seriously unless we go the whole hog and give this statutorily recognised body the power to prosecute now that the way has been cleared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney South and Shore-ditch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. However it is one thing to give SIB the power but quite another for SIB to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has disturbed me is that Lloyd's has a power to prosecute which it has not used. For some time the solicitor at Lloyd's in correspondence with a name, James Birkin, denied that Lloyd's had that power, but it has now admitted that it has. Lloyd's found Peter Dixon guilty beyond reasonable doubt—that is the same standard as in criminal cases—but has refused to go ahead with the prosecution for two reasons. First, it is expensive. Lloyd's should be funded to prosecute or a mechanism should be devised whereby it could reclaim the money from the state. Secondly, Lloyd's maintains that if people are fined the fine will go to the state. That is an entirely inadequate reason for not prosecuting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powers can be put into a statute but the body concerned may not have the will to implement them. So if the amendment is accepted, I hope that it will be made clear to SIB that we expect it to operate the power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has raised an important point. It is pointless to give any body the power to prosecute if it fails to follow it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that under the amendment SIB would have the resources to prosecute. It could raise funds by means of fees from authorised investment businesses, whereas the cost to the Secretary of State would be borne by the taxpayer. It is difficult to see why the taxpayer should have to bear the cost of prosecutions and why the investors who are being protected should have to pay. The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point.

If the Government put half as much effort into investigations and prosecutions as they have into resisting amendments put to the Committee, there is hope for success. It is a great disappointment to me, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
rather a sad reflection on our proceedings, that amendments tabled in the public interest have been fought so hard by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine what my hon. and learned Friend said in another context at our previous sitting, because his remarks are relevant here. He said of SIB:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am afraid that I simply do not understand the basis on which the hon. Member for Dagenham says that the Securities and Investments Board will be closer to the ground than the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is a remarkable statement. Irrespective of whether the board is a private or public body, it should be down in the City close to the ground. Although many authorised investment businesses will belong to SROs, others will be directly authorised by the board. My hon. and learned Friend made a remarkable comment and I do not agree with it. The board should be closer to the ground than the Department of Trade and Industry is ever likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that that was why the Department of Trade and Industry did not want the job of regulating the system directly on its own, which was one of Professor Gower's options. SIB felt that it would be inappropriate for it to do so, for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, when we discussed the power to investigate my hon. and learned Friend mentioned the power to prosecute and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The disadvantage that would result from giving the designated agency the power to prosecute—a power that several hon. Members would like it to have—is a matter to which I adverted in an earlier debate. I made a point that found favour with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). Any decisions on prosecutions are really matters requiring a particular kind of experience and expertise. That experience, which exists in the Department of Trade and Industry—a prosecuting authority—is not present in the designated agency, nor is it necessary."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1986; c. 886–7.]</p></blockquote>
That is a circular argument which I wish to examine. What is the experience and staffing of the Department of Trade and Industry? Lord Roskill examined the Department in his Fraud Trials Committee Report and said in paragraph 2.16:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The DTI has its own investigation staff which includes members with police, accounting and legal training. In the Companies Investigation Branch there are some 35 members of staff dealing with inquiries under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985."</p></blockquote>
Lord Roskill went on to give details of the staff. They have never worked anywhere other than in Government service. As Lord Roskill said; most of them start in the insolvency service, filling in forms for the Official Receiver. They are really audit clerks. When they have some experience they are moved to this area of investigation. Most of them have no experience of the outside world, of the City of or business. That has been a grave deficiency of the Department and is why outside inspectors are sometimes appointed. There is a power to appoint outside inspectors, who are usually lawyers and accountants with experience of the matters that they investigate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about experience is not as substantial as my hon. and learned Friend would have us believe, but even if it were it would not be insuperable. If we gave the SIB the power of prosecution, some of those splendidly experienced staff could be transferred to the SIB. That is why the argument on experience is a circular one.

	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
I am also worried about the domination of lawyers. The committee, which was chaired by a lawyer, identified the domination of lawyers, but the whole process of prosecution is lawyer ridden. That is why there are delays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend who has a vested interest in these matters says that it is amazing, but it is true. I shall give an example of what happens when the Government appoint an accountant and a QC to head an investigation. The investigation is headed by the QC but the accountant does all the work because he has a large firm. However the investigation is conducted at a rate to suit the QC. If the QC has to go to Hong Kong because he has a good job there, the investigation grinds to a halt until he comes back and takes up the reins again. The QC picks it up and puts it down as it suits him. That is why some inquiries take such an inordinately long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another unsatisfactory aspect is the fact that if the Department of Trade and Industry wants to appoint a QC it cannot act on its own say-so but must consult the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General, who is a lawyer, decides which QC will get the job. If a QC who is a pal of his has not had too much work recently, he will give him the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good example of that was when Mr. Justice Griffiths was given the job of investigating share dealings in the House of Fraser. He had no experience whatever of dealing with City matters, and he had to start off by finding out what a share register was, and what the provisions of the Companies Act were, before he could embark upon his investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DPP is slow in bringing prosecutions and reasonably slow progress suits lawyers on both sides of the case because fees accrue more quickly. When the fraud investigation group was set up, the Department of Trade and Industry wanted to have control of it because, as it said, "We are the people who have experience of such matters." But the lawyers moved into action and said, "Oh no, it will come under the Attorney-General." So now the fraud investigation group is under the Attorney-General, and that is why the proposal in the Roskill report, to which reference was made in a story in 	<i>The Times</i> yesterday, is so important. The fraud investigation group is obviously an improvement on what went before, because it now employs three accountants—which is a tremendous step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard such a catalogue of drivel for a long time. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) at least be reasonable and explain to the Committee that he happens to be an accountant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is well aware that I am an accountant, so obviously it could be argued that I have a vested interest. However, a more substantial accountancy input would be in the public interest because many lawyers have no experience of sophisticated financial fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My institute has recently been laying on seminars on fraud for High Court judges, and they have found them
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
very useful. They have the same difficulty that many juries have in understanding the complexities of financial fraud. Accountants, who have resources at their disposal, and deal with financial matters—their bread and butter—all the time, are able to bring to bear on them valuable experience. I make no secret of—and no apology for—the fact that I believe that there are too many lawyers in this House, in the other House, and in Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), I was talking about the fraud investigation group and the reference to the Roskill report, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The recent placing of three accountants in the DPP's Department on a permanent basis as part of the FIG arrangements has, in the Controller's view, already proved itself 'invaluable'. We were not at all surprised to hear that the most frequent comment in the Department is 'How did we ever manage without them?'"</p></blockquote>
There are three accountants in the fraud investigation group, so we need to do extactly what the Government appear to be proposing, which is to go a stage further— as Roskill recommended—and set up a fraud commission so that instead of departments squabbling with each other about their responsibilities, there would be a coordinated response. Before we do that, we should adopt this amendment, which would give to SIB the power to prosecute. Although the previous amendment was rejected, SIB still has the power—in circumstances that, in my view, are far too limited—to investigate authorised investment businesses, so it should have the power to follow through and prosecute where appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Perhaps I should say that he is a leading spokesman for the accountant tendency that is tearing the Conservative party apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some weeks ago, shortly after the Committee forced through the change to clause 96, there was a leading article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> that took a sensible view of the proceedings of the Committee and the course of the Bill. It said that it might have been better, in the light of the change that the Committee had brought about, if the Government had recognised from an early stage that the desirable outcome was to have a statutory commission, so that the Committee could concentrate on deciding how that statutory commission should work, what element of practitioner based experience should be brought in, how flexible it should be, what independence should be required of City and of Government, and so on. That, the 	<i>Financial Times</i> argued—and I agree with it—would have been a more fruitful course for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is, as the 	<i>Financial Times</i> warned, that the Government, having set their face against the statutory commission even through the Committee favours it, have compelled the Committee to look at a series of amendments, in which we are trying to make the statutory commission a reality, in an artificial context. Some of the recent debates in Committee have been less than satisfactory, because we have to operate in an unsatisfactory context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go over again the arguments—which I endorse—of the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Beaconsfield. I share the puzzlement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the remarks that his hon. and learned Friend made in an earlier debate. The Minister said that he doubted whether, indeed, he denied that, the Securities and Investments Board would be in a better position than his Department. The hon. Gentleman quoted him as saying that the Securities and Investments Board would not be closer to the ground than the Department. As I said at the time, if that is the Minister's view, it is hard to see why we are spending so much time on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is designed exclusively to set up a body that will do the job. We have set up that body, albeit unsatisfactorily, and the Government must assume, as the opposition do, that it will be better placed to carry out the functions than the Department of Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says, as I think he is obliged to, that there is value in having a Securities and Investments Board, but that it cannot develop the sort of expertise that will be required to investigate and to prosecute, and that it would be inappropriate for it even to think of developing such expertise, we are left with the questions to which the 	<i>Financial Times</i> referred: what is the body with which we are supposed to be dealing and what are the Government thinking about when they talk of the Securities and Investments Board?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SIB will never be able to develop the expertise needed to prosecute, will it ever have the expertise to do any of the things that the Bill requires of it? There is a lacuna in the Government's thinking and it is baffling the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us go for a good Anglo-Saxon word: gap. Let us forget all the lawyer-like Roman law stuff, and talk about gaps rather than lacunae in the Government's thinking. However one describes it, there is something in the Government's reasoning that is not apparent to the Committee—it fails to gel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not have the courage to go where City opinion and the Committee have tried to lead them, so the Committee is left wrestling with a broken-backed, weak-kneed, pussy-footed compromise, when what we need is a body with clear powers for which we can ensure the flexibility that will make it work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Minister cooperates with the Committee, we shall be wasting our time. We shall be left with the unsatisfactory compromise that was implicit in the Bill when it was first put forward, and that compromise will be compounded by the Government's refusal to accept the Committee's judgment about what the Securities and Investments Board ought to be and about what powers it ought to exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. Our proceedings may come to a close today. That will be not a moment too soon for the Government, as Conservative Members seem to be crossing the divide. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) sounds more and more like the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore every time he gets to his feet—I admire the hon. Member for Hackney, South
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
and Shoreditch greatly, though I would not seek to emulate him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said about lawyers. Shortly after I arrived in the House of Commons a colleague complained to me that half of the Members of the House are lawyers and the other half need them. As usual, I am in the middle on this matter. The Minister would probably say that I am sitting on the fence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not require the SIB to have exclusive powers. Others mentioned in the clause will be able to take similar action. But such powers will give the SIB the status and standing to attract the right kind of people. Flexibility of operation is important when working in a constantly changing area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal in the amendment follows logically from previous proposals. I hope that the Minister will note the strength of opinion ranged against him on all sides and will consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) could take time off from the Fulham by-election to participate in our proceedings this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is inappropriate for the hon. Gentleman, with the back-up of his colleagues, to criticise my attendance record, which is equal to any Back Bencher on the Committee, including himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members have evened the score, so perhaps we can get on with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friends. I speak as neither an accountant, nor a solicitor. When I was in business I thought that it was too dominated by accountants. Now that I am in the House, I share the view that the House is too dominated by lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It amazes me that anyone would resist the amendment. In the light of recent events, surely the Government would be delighted not to rely on in-house lawyers for almost anything. That also applies in the financial sector. The apparent dilatory attitude towards prosecutions at Lloyd's has cause concern, and it would be disastrous if that were repeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effective prosecution is a prerequisite for investor protection. How can an amendment that is likely to make prosecutions more frequent or more effective be regarded as going againt the interests of investor protection? I do not believe that effective prosecution will drive business away from London as a financial centre. The opposite is almost certainly true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was attracted by the arguments in some of the other amendments, but this amendment has even more to recommend it. Therefore, I shall be interested to know whether my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary can show that the amendments are not in the interests of investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heartily agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) that any amendment which will make prosecutions more frequent and more effective should command the Committee's support. However, I believe that such a result would not be the consequence of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) complained that amendments put forward in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
the public interest had been resisted by the Government. He should recognise that if others take a genuine and different view of the public interest, it is incumbent on them to fight hard so that their view may prevail. The question is which view would be most in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to whether the designated agency should be given the power to prosecute. My arguments here are essentially the same as those that I put in our debate on clause 96. On that occasion, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) gave me his qualified support, by saying that he recognised the force of my arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last occasion when the hon. and learned Gentleman attributed that view to me, I did not think that it was worth rising to contradict him. However, as he clearly intends to place some reliance on our supposed agreement on that point, I must tell him that that is not my view, although it seems that I may have inadvertently given him the wrong impression. I have always taken the view that it would be appropriate for SIB to develop such expertise, and I see no reason why it should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman makes his position plain. Nevertheless, he recognised the force of my arguments, which I shall put before Committee members again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to bring a prosecution is one which should be made as a result of particular experience and expertise. The matters to be taken into account include an assessment of the kind of material available as a consequence of the investigations, and an assessment of the extent to which that matches up to the particular requirements of the rules of evidence which are specific to the criminal court. There are also matters relating to the burden of proof to be established in the criminal court, the extent to which it will be possible to convince a jury of the nature of that evidence, and whether such evidence points to a conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it would be possible for the designated agency to hire people with that experience. However, that would be unnecessary, as the expertise, which is available elsewhere, would then be duplicated. I therefore suggest that the designated agency does not need such powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the possibility of setting up a unified organisation which would have responsibility for prosecutions in cases of fraud. The Government are considering that matter, although no decision has yet been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a body would report to a Minister, whether it is the Attorney-General or someone else. The designated agency would not report to a Minister, so it would not have the same accountability as the unified organisation. The unified organisation, incidentally, was recommended by the Roskill committee to try and prevent a proliferation of agencies responsible for prosecution. Paragraph 2.46 of the Roskill committee report states that if such a unified organisation were to be set up
	<br><blockquote><p>"fewer serious frauds would be allowed to escape prosecution by slipping through the net of a series of independent organisations working in this field".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
At the heart of the Roskill committee's concern was a desire to unify the organisation responsible for prosecuting serious frauds, and an apprehension about the proliferation of agencies with the duty to prosecute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not lead to quicker and more effective prosecutions, which was the test right identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South as the basis on which Committee members should approach the question. On the contrary, it would lead to an undesirable and unnecessary duplication of the scarce human resources with particular experience and expertise which would be necessary to make any decisions on prosecutions. For those reasons, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend for making his position so clear and consistent, but I remain of the view that the SIB's power of prosecution is an essential adjunct to those responsibilities that it is given in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend adduced the arguments that there might not, and perhaps should not, be the expertise within the SIB to undertake such prosecutions and secondly, that the acquisition of the power would amount to duplication of that enjoyed by the Department of Trade and Industry. If my hon. and learned Friend is correct, Members of the Committee must ask themselves whether they are happy with the number of prosecutions and convictions that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that although I share his unhappiness about that record, it is precisely that mischief which the Roskill committee, with its review of the law of evidence and the procedures to be adopted in the criminal courts, was set up to deal with? It has made a large number of recommendations to secure that objective and, in that context the Government have given their general acceptance of its conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I agree. I said so earlier with reference to the report that I quoted from 	<i>The Times.</i> But my hon. and learned Friend is talking about fraud and the matters considered by Roskill. We are considering matters that are not covered by Roskill—powers accorded to the Securities and Investments Board that are without that process. Any prosecution taken by my hon. and learned Friend in respect of offences under the Bill will not, as far as I am aware, be subject to the special jury procedures or prosecuted by any body that may be set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson)? We are not legislating to set up the sort of body recommended by Roskill; that may be a different matter. The Minister is inviting us to legislate to retain the status quo, which we all agree is unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur with those remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second reason why we should be disinclined to accept the view that the amendment would result in duplication or an inability through lack of expertise to prosecute effectively. Many of the powers and the responsibilities in the Bill are new; they are there to deal with a new situation. When the Secretary of State is satisfied that the SIB can take over those powers, he will probably delegate those powers to it, so the SIB
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
will have that direct responsibility and the Secretary of State will not. So one will have the responsibility and the other will have the power to prosecute. That does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a valid answer to say that there could be duplication. If it were an argument at all, it would be an argument for the Secretary of State to give up the powers of prosecution and to hand them to the SIB. Once the powers are delegated to the SIB it must be able to follow them through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does nothing to prevent what the Secretary of State already wants to do. A responsible chairman of the SIB should not be encouraged to undertake prosecutions if he is not satisfied that he can get a conviction, for example, if it is against the public interest or if he cannot get the legal expertise to do it. No sensible man would do that because he is charged with a responsibility and he may leave it to the Secretary of State. But statutorily to prevent him from exercising that power surely does not accord with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that if the amendment were accepted, we would expect that, in practice, the SIB would exercise those powers, for the good practical reason that it is expected to be closer to the ground and to have greater expertise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Any person affected by any such proposed rules and regulatoins may make representations thereon to the Secretary of State who shall consider such representations before deciding whether to exercise his power to make rules and regulations under this chapter.".</p></blockquote>
With your indulgence, Sir Michael, I might perhaps refer to the starred amendment No. 400 on the amendment paper in my name, as I consider that to be an improvement on my original amendment No. 152.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Sir Michael. Given the extraordinarily wide powers in clause 161, under which the Secretary of State "may make regulations" and considering the regulations that may be made under chapter V of part I, there ought to be a way in which representation can be made to the Secretary of State after he has published his proposals, and he should then be required to consider the representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there may be emergencies or exceptional cases when the Secretary of State has to bring in regulations or rules quickly to deal with possible abuses. Nevertheless, as a general principle it is important for the ordinary conduct of the market that notice and consultation should be provided, and I should therefore be glad if my hon. Friend would concede an amendment along the lines I have suggested in amendment No. 152.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. John Butcher) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the depth of feeling expressed by my hon. Friend that there should in normal circumstances be proper consultation before rules and regulations made under the Bill come into force. That is a view which I share, and I am glad that the SIB has already shown, by its publication of draft rules and request for comments, that it is keen to consult widely about rules and regulations. However, I agree that the Bill itself should require the designated agency to consult before making rules, except in cases where there is a need to act immediately to deal with some emergency. However, I think that we need to approach the point in a slightly different way from that suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's second amendment, amendment No. 400 was a tidier amendment which reflected more clearly what he wanted to achieve. In the light of the views expressed today, I propose to bring forward an amendment to require consultation prior to making rules, except in emergencies. I hope that that will go a long way to satisfying my hon. Friend's well-argued point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) will be grateful for that.
