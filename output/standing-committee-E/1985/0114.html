	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<div class='title'>COMPOSITION OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [10 December],</i> No. 1, in page 1, line 9, leave out "cease to be" and insert "be reappointed as".—	<i>[Mr. Buchan.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 13, leave out from "be" to end of line 14 and insert "six".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving the amendment before the Christmas recess, my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) raised several interesting questions that the Government should answer. When replying to the debate, I hope that the Minister will tell us why he seeks a change in the board of governors. He must establish that need for a change and convince his hon. Friends of it—he will certainly have a job convincing Opposition Members. I presume that the hon. Gentleman's advice is to resist the amendment and that he will recommend his hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree with Conservative Members that when addressing the Minister, the hon. Gentleman should refer to him as the "right hon. Gentleman" and congratulate him on his elevation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Anthony, I take great pleasure in offering the congratulations of Opposition Members to the Minister on his elevation to the Privy Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It shows the Government's regard for the arts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, I hope that the elevation shows a recognition of the importance of his new office as Minister for the Arts, as well as of the contributions that he may have made to his party and to the House generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must convince all Committee members that there is a need for change. If he believes that there is, presumably he has some criticism of the individuals presently serving on the board of governors, the way in which they are selected, or the groupings which they represent. Unless he has criticisms of them as individuals or as representa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
tives, it seems strange and perverse for the Government to seek to change the museum's board of governors purely wilfully and without any just cause. Therefore, Opposition Members expect the Minister to give some coherent and convincing reasons why he sees it necessary to seek that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be especially grateful if the Minister addressed himself to the present make-up of the board, because it contains some extremely interesting people who have given good service to the museum. If he has criticisms, the Committee is the proper place for him to bring them forward. It will be interesting to know whether he has criticisms of the board and why he believes that the changes envisaged by the Bill will improve the quality of the government of the museum. Unless he can convince us that the quality of governorship of the museum will improve, there seems little point in introducing the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I managed to obtain a list of the membership of the board of governors. The membership is wide-ranging and seems distinguished, with some members possessing skills and experience which surely must be recognised by all members of the Committee as contributing greatly to the judgment and consideration of matters affecting the museum when the board of governors meets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general example, I cite the fact that Sir Ashley Bramall—the present chairman of the staff committee—is on the board. I am sure that leaving politics aside hon. Members will recognise the enormous contribution that Sir Ashley has made for many years—presently as chairman of ILEA and throughout his career—to education in London. Surely, all members of the Committee would believe it to be an impoverishment of the board of governor's quality if someone with the educational experience, especially in terms of London, of Sir Ashley were not on the board to ensure that the way in which the museum developed embraced the full understanding of the educational needs of museums and the way in which museums can and do educate young people about the history, culture and a range of past and present activities of our capital city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there can be no criticism of such people as Sir Ashley. The Minister might say that some of the appointments have been politically motivated. Opposition Ministers probably would recognise that that was true and consider that to be a good reason for appointing governors. I am sure that the Opposition and the Government have a difference of opinion on that issue. We stress that political appointments made by the Conservative party — some GLC appointees on the board of governors are Conservative members of the GLC and have been appointed by the Labour controlled GLC — and by the Labour party have a valuable part to play. Moreover, there should be intelligent and reasoned political dialogue about the nature of London and its history. It would be foolish, pointless and wrong to try to say that the presentation and interpretation of the history of London by the Museum of London was non-political. It is not.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
How one interprets history is a highly-charged political issue, and it is fair and proper that the full range of political attitudes towards the history of London should be presented in the museum, both in its choice of archives and in its presentation of permanent and other exhibitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would stress the political nature of history. It makes a positive contribution, not solely in a partisan sense but in terms of our belief that politics plays an important and crucial part in history, especially in the interpretation and presentation of that history. Therefore, it is impossible logically to present a non-political, objective view of history. By its very nature, the presentation of history is subjective. I believe that the range of subjective attitudes towards history should be reflected on the board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason it is important that such people as John Gorman, who is an extremely distinguished Labour-Socialist historian, has published such works as "Images of Socialism" and is a design artist of great distinction, represent a particular political viewpoint on the board of governors and contribute in that way, just as there is room within that presentation of history for a more academic and objective approach towards history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend received the Christmas card which, as chairman of the Greater London council, I sent him. The card was designed and printed by John Gorman. I hope that my hon. Friend admired the quality of the design and the printing. I endorse my hon. Friend's remarks. Mr. Gorman is a most distinguished designer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was under the impression that my hon. Friend's Christmas card was by Walter Crane. It was extremely beautiful, and I had not appreciated that John Gorman designed the card on which the Crane work was shown. I expect that you, Sir Anthony, received a card from my hon. Friend, too. They really stood out as beautiful works of art among some of the less elevating artistic efforts on Christmas cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the amendment, there is room on the board of governors not only for partisan and strongly-held political views but for more academic and slightly more objective views on London and its history. Dr. Valerie Pearl is the president of New Hall, Cambridge and an extremely distinguished historian, especially in the history of London. She has been a governor for seven or eight years and is valuable to the board of governors because of her ability and experience. Members of the Committee may be aware of her works, such as "London and the Outbreak of the Puritan Revolution" and her studies in London history. It is vital that historians of her range and special interest in London are kept on the board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are others with perhaps less historical or political involvement in London but who have a wide understanding of the way of life in London at present. I refer to Simon Jenkins, who is the political
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
editor of 	<i>The Economist</i> and a former editor of the London 	<i>Evening Standard</i> in which he wrote a column about living in London, which some members of the Committee will recall. It was a well-researched, amusing and wide-ranging column that was enjoyed by people living in London. Recently, he wrote a companion guide to outer London. Although my hon. Friends may not agree with Mr. Jenkins' political views, as expressed when he was editor of the 	<i>Evening Standard</i>—seldom has that paper had sympathy for the Labour party—we recognise that such people, with their knowledge and proven interest in London, have an enormous contribution to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister tries to persuade the Committee that the make-up of the board of governors should change, he must tell us why people such as Dr Pearl, John Gorman and Sir Ashley Bramall, the latter two being Labour sympathisers, should not continue to make their excellent contributions to that board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister changes the present structure of the board of governors, he should make clear what criteria will be used for future appointments. People in London need reassurance that there will be a balanced board of governors which reflects the needs and interests of everyone and all cultural activity both past and present. It is important that the Minister justifies his reasons for changing the board of governors and clarifies the basis on which he will formulate that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a difficult task ahead of him in convincing fair-minded hon Members that the present board of governors has not done a good job, and that it cannot and should not continue to do that good job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanky</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have visited the Museum of London since the Committee last sat and was honoured that you, Sir Anthony, and Lady Meyer were present on the excellent tour that we enjoyed. I am sure you agree that the exhibits and their display were authoritative, educational, exciting and entertaining. I found the museum one of the most imaginative and attractive that I have visited. It is apparent that those who work there have a great love for the history of London and care about the conservation, preservation and presentation of London's history. That is a tribute to the present board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support the amendment because I believe that the new board should start afresh when the Bill is enacted, and there is no reason why the present governors who have served well cannot be re-appointed. However, instead of the GLC, the City of London corporation and the Government each appointing six governors, the Government and the corporation will each appoint nine governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After my visit to that excellent museum, the contribution made by the London boroughs stuck in my mind. It is not a City of London museum but a museum for all of London. In changing the selection of the board to nine members from the City of London corporation and nine from the Government, I am worried that the interests of the London
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
boroughs will not be taken into account. I shall be grateful if my right hon. Friend assures the Committee that the interests of Greater London will be represented after the reconstitution of the board, or at least that the new board will have a duty to have regard to the interests of Greater London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said. Labour Members are anxious to preserve on the governing body a representation that is wider than simply the City of London. There is a danger that when and if governors are selected by the City to represent the interests of local government they may consider London's history to have occurred predominantly within the one square mile. We must try to prevent that because, as the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes said, the museum covers the whole of London's history. We wish to preserve that role for the museum, and that is the rationale of the amendment. We believe that the present GLC-nominated governors ensure that the museum maintains a London-wide appreciation of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes in giving credit to the staff for its work and the excellence of its presentation of exhibits which are second to none. That is due partly to the presence of GLC-nominated governors and the funds made available by the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Prime Minister first envisaged the abolition of the GLC, I doubt whether she gave a moment's thought to the Museum of London. That surprises me, because I know that the Prime Minister has a great love of museums. Opposition Members could argue that she is doing an excellent job of turning the country into one gigantic industrial museum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not my hon. Friend being under-generous to the Prime Minister? Although one might have hoped that she would have thought of institutions such as the Museum of London, my hon. Friend implied that some thought was given to the clear personal policy involved in the manifesto commitment. I suggest that there was little thought but much prejudice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend missed my point; I was saying that I doubted whether the Prime Minister gave any thought to the Museum of London or even knew that it was part-funded by the GLC. The Prime Minister is known to like history, and it is a pity that she was unaware that the GLC funded the museum and nominated governors to serve on the museum board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) and I know that the Museum of London is only one of the museums which the GLC either wholly or partly funds. The Minister comes late to the problem of abolition—no doubt he is grateful for that, but he will not escape entirely. I suggest that the Minister should think once, twice, perhaps three times before committing himself on what will happen to the Museum of London after
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
the abolition of the GLC. That should also apply to the many other institutions and services which will pass from! the GLC to a variety of successor bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government changed their position about the disposition of some of the GLC controlled, or funded, bodies between the publication of "Streamlining the Cities" and the publication of the Bill and this Committee stage. Changes are still being made because the Government have found that the abolition of the GLC is like breaking up a large jigsaw puzzle. Having destroyed the original plan, they are still cutting away with the scissors in an effort to make the pieces fit together again. The end product will make a very sorry picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The presence of GLC-dominated governors on the board has provided an essential London-wide dimension. After the abolition of the GLC, a greater interest should be taken in the development of the history of municipal government in London. The Museum of London could do that, but it would need strengthening by the inclusion of local government nominees to ensure that its policy was right. By leaving the GLC-nominated governors on the board, at least for the time being, that London-wide dimension of the development of municipal history will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) said that some governors were nominated by the GLC and others by the Government. Nothing in the Bill prevents the City of London corporation or the Minister from nominating any of the existing governors, including the GLC nominees. It is most unlikely that the Government will do that. If the Minister will say that it is his firm intention to nominate a number of people bceause of their GLC connections, perhaps we can move on to another amendment. The Minister declines my invitation so I shall plough on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude from the Minister's silence that the Government will not nominate anyone who has any connection with the GLC, either directly as a member or indirectly as a nominee of the council. The Prime Minister's approach to nominees is, "Is he or she one of ours?" She is likely to take a party-political approach on the nomination of governors. That is a pity. The GLC has not used that approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend knows about the Labour History museum in Limehouse. It would be worth while for Conservative Members to visit it. The museum is run efficiently on a shoe string by its management committee, director and staff—all of whom, are members of working-class organisations. It is not necessary for people with high-sounding titles to run a museum. The staff of the museum, all ordinary people, show that they are capable of running a good history museum for the people of London. Ordinary people should be appointed as governors of the Museum of London. Perhaps my hon. Friend will consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will take that into consideration. The GLC nominated John Gorman and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Richard Nicholls, for example, to give the governing body of the Museum of London the experience of two people who were active and knowledgeable members of the wider Labour movement. While there may be differences in Committee about the significance of the Labour movement in the development of London's history, surely it cannot be denied that the great wealth of London as a whole has been based on the efforts of the mass of the population—ordinary working men and women. Unfortunately, not enough of them are working. There are 360,000 unemployed in London. That is the largest urban concentration of unemployment in the whole of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the Labour movement should be taken into account by the Museum of London. When I was chairman of the arts and recreation committee and responsible for nominating people to the Museum of London, I thought that the history of the Labour movement had not been taken fully into account, hence John Gorman's and Richard Nicholls' nomination to the board of the Museum of London. John Gorman is also active in the Labour History museum in Limehouse, so he is able to link the two. I hope that that link continues to flourish and is greatly strengthened. When I first went to the history museum, I did not feel that it was paying enough attention to the great richness of the contribution to London's history made by the Labour movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should amplify Mr. Gorman's qualifications as a member of the board of governors of the Museum of London. He is a distinguished printer, designer and author. I declare an interest in that he is a good personal friend of mine. He was born in Stratford, in my constituency of New-ham, North-West. I hope that some Conservative Members saw the exhibition called "Banner Bright" mounted by John Gorman in the White-chapel art gallery. If they did not see it, they could buy a copy of the book entitled "Banner Bright". A copy of that book was presented to me when I left the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers after being head of research for some years until January 1975. The book is inscribed, "To Tony, with fraternal best wishes from John Gorman." At the time, the GLC had made a significant contribution to the 50th anniversary of the general strike of 1926. Very interestingly, the book is also signed by Norman Willis on behalf of 11 million members of the TUC. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) would like to see the book. He remembers the AUEW well because he was the assistant general secretary of the union when I was a humble member involved in research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would come closer to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I allowed myself to be slightly diverted. If any hon. Member needs proof of Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Gorman's qualifications, he would do well to look at that book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about the link between the Labour History museum and the Museum of London, the Union of Amalgamated Engineering Workers has set up a museum of its own. Exhibitions put on by a trade union should be put on by the Museum of London. If it is necessary for trade unions to show such exhibits, it demonstrates that there is a weakness within the existing museums in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree again with my hon. Friend. It merely emphasises the fact that it is necessary to nominate to the board of governors people who can bring a wider perspective to the museum's policies, exhibits and so on. I had felt originally that the museum was not doing enough in that regard, and that is why I sought to strengthen the board of governors by nominating Mr. Gorman and Mr. Nicholls as members of the board. I hope that their contribution has been satisfactory. They have worked exceedingly hard on behalf of the museum by lobbying funding bodies, particularly the GLC, and they have emphasised the history of the Labour movement within the London-wide dimension in the museum's exhibits and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gorman did a singular service for London through the "Banner Bright" exhibition. He records in his book that in the May Day parade in London in 1898, 400 craft banners were displayed. Perhaps trade union banners are not nearest to the hearts of Conservative Members, but I am sure that they recognise that such banners are an essential ingredient of our social history. Indeed, many of them represent some splendid examples of artefacts. The enormous paintings on the banners of the silk weavers are wonderful to look at as artefacts as well as having a social significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gorman organised a collection of those banners, many of which were threatened with extinction from the damage suffered over the years. He did more than anyone to remind Londoners that there is an important part of their history which is often disregarded, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to cite a further example on the narrowness of museums. Friends of mine, Mr Frow and his wife, are members of the engineering union, and they have collected such materials because of the deficiency in museums. The whole of their house is given over to artefacts, inscribed rolls and scrolls and literature referring to the history of working people. Therefore, the governors of a museum must consist of people who have a proper appreciation of the role of the majority of our people whose history should be reflected in that museum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, I am in complete agreement with my hon Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. There are few people who are distinguished in the Labour movement as my hon Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue with my discussion in favour of Mr Gorman. I hope that by the time I finish my speech, the Minister will have scribbled John Gorman's name on his pad as being a person whom he will undoubtedly reappoint as one of the Government's nominees to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr Gorman is also an excellent photographer. I assure the Committee that I am not here to plug his books to increase sales. His book entitled "To Build Jurusalem" was published recently, and I understand that it was a book choice, so it is popular. I read from the flyleaf:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The part played by ordinary working people and the changes in their circumstances over the last century have been considerable. A vital role was played by the labour movement and to understand why it is as it is today demands a familiarity with the history of working people. This book with its extraordinary photographs and perceptive text recreates this history, not only detailing many of the great events of modern times but also the ordinary events in the lives of working people. For many readers this volume will open up a completely new field of experience."</p></blockquote>
Certainly, if Conservative Members read the book, it will open up a "new field of experience" one that they will find rewarding. It is a remarkable book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Gorman has done a great service for everyone who is interested in the social history of London. I strongly recommend the book. You may be interested to know, Sir Anthony, that the copy I have here is not signed by Mr. Gorman but I shall, of course, have it signed in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members are not convinced by my arguments for retaining Mr. Gorman on the board of governors—his contribution to labour history, his knowledge of printing and design, and his writing —perhaps they will be convinced by the argument that he is a great fan of cricket and real ale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister will appoint Mr. Gorman but that seems unlikely in view of the Government's record. On 9 December I asked the Prime Minister to list every public body to which she has appointed members in the past five years. That list is formidable and includes the Museums and Galleries Commission, the British Museum, the Imperial War Museum, the Museum of London, the National Maritime Museum, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the Wallace Collection, the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Kennedy Memorial Trust, the City Parochial Foundation, the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee—it obviously does not scrutinise the nominations very much—the Police Arbitration Tribunal, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be unjust to the Prime Minister but I doubt whether the right hon. Lady has nominated anyone who is not either a member or a strong supporter of the Conservative party. It is a sign not of strength but of weakness that the Prime
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Minister cannot tolerate any form of opposition. The right hon. Lady shows that weakness when appointing members to boards of museums and bodies such as those I listed—she tries to minimise opposition by appointing friends of the Conservative party, personal friends, or people who are known to be strongly supportive of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often hear about non-political nominees. However, my experience is that when the Conservative party talks about non-political people, it means true blue Tories. It is interesting to see how the Conservative party is able to indoctrinate a body so that it is impossible for any other political opinion to creep in. A ring fence is then erected and the body is declared to be non-political. That is wondrous to behold and very frustrating for Opposition Members. I hope that when a Labour Government come to power we shall have learnt our lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making an excellent point. He is right in saying that virtually all Government appointments are political. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a huge element of corruption in that? I do not know whether it is the case with Government appointees to the board of the Museum of London, but some appointees receive large pay-offs of thousands of pounds for very little work. That amounts to corruption in public life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Member not to pursue that line, which is not directly related to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect what you say, Sir Anthony. However, one part of my hon. Friend's argument is relevant to the amendment. Nominees from democratically-elected bodies have some accountability that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for corruption to occur. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) laughs in his basso profundo voice, but if he wishes to intervene and give a clear example of where my argument is incorrect, I shall, of course, give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bowden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the words of the hon. Gentleman during the previous sitting when he encouraged my hight hon. Friend the Minister to visit museums. I recall in 1983, when the hon. Member for Newham, Northwest (Mr. Banks) was wearing another hat as chairman of the arts and recreation committee of the Greater London council, that that committee gave a grant of about £6,000 to the Dulwich picture gallery. At that time, the predecessor of present Minister for the Arts visited the Dulwich gallery. I heard afterwards that the chairman of the arts and recreation committee was hopping mad and threatened to withdraw the grant from the gallery if a Minister made a political visit to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West was misrepresented because there was a strong feeling in Dulwich that that seemed like blackmail on the part of the GLC. The hon. Gentleman might welcome the opportunity to clear his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
name of any such imputation and to say how pleased he was that the then Minister for the Arts visited the gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Member will reply to that intervention briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you said that, Sir Anthony, because that point was slightly tangential to good order. However, it raised an important issue. Yes, I was upset by that visit because it took place during an election campaign. The Minister wore a Tory rosette and made a party political speech, which was why I objected. The gallery was supposed to be removing itself from the more overt forms of party-political campaigning. It was disgraceful of the Minister to do that, and I know that the present Minister—being an honourable person—would not dream of acting in such an irresponsible and party-political fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we now get back to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Anthony. If there is democratic accountability with regard to nominees, the corruption that was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) will not occur. Clearly, as political administrations change, so can the nominees, although we preserved a high level of continuity in our GLC nominees to the board of the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While discussing the corruption aspect, it is not so much the matter of money that my hon. Friends need to consider. It is the corruption that comes through the honours that people receive—the knighthoods, peerages and so on—for their services to the Conservative cause. As we know, the Prime Minister uses the patronage system, in that way and it is now being brought into public contempt generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth (Startford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give the hon. Gentleman the opportuity to re-import some realism into the debate. I hope that he will concede that it is very much to the credit of the Government that they have taken an axe to the extraordinary jungle of quangos and paid public appointments that was allowed to grow up during the period between 1974 and 1979 under the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman knows anything about local government—which I doubt from his intervention—he will know that, far from! streamlining local government, seven democratically-elected authorities have been superseded by hundreds of successor bodies, including a large number of quangos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we really must now get back to the Bill and to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Anthony. I shall refer to the other GLC nominees on the board. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred to Sir Ashley Bramall. Sir Ashley is the chairman of the Inner London Education Authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
and a past chairman of the GLC, an office which I now hold. I am the last in a long line of chairmen of the LCC and the GLC and I am proud to hold that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Ashley brings a wealth of local government experience to the deliberations of the board and his services are appreciated by the director and his staff. I believe that Sir Ashley is also chairman of the board's staff committee. Therefore, he knows a great deal about the industrial relations of the museum as well as bringing a depth of knowledge of local government to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister thinks about nominations, I hope that he will seek to keep Sir Ashley Bramall. An interesting family connection arises because his brother, Sir Edwin Bramall, has just been named the new Lord Lieutenant of London. Sir Ashley would be an excellent nominee but, despite all his qualifications. I doubt whether the Minister will nominate him because Sir Ashley is a good, loyal, long-serving member of the GLC and the London county council before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a former Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend because Sir Ashley was a Member of Parliament from 1946 to 1950 and was, I believe, defeated by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath). Therefore, Sir Ashley's qualifications should recommend him to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To demonstrate to Conservative Members that we do not take a dog-in-the-manger attitude towards our nominees I shall mention two nominees from the GLC who are well known to the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Bowden), who is looking at me intently. They are Willie Bell and Michael Wheeler who are now serving as members of the Conservative administration. I have spoken to them personally and they would like to maintain their membership of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may well decide, because they are both members of the Conservative party, that it will be safe to keep them on the board and he will not get into trouble with the Prime Minister. If that is the way he makes his choice, we must accept it. I would rather have two old Tories on the board who were members of the GLC than have no ex-members of the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of democracy we include members of the minority party on the museum board—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering whether my hon. Friend is being fair because after the events of the last couple of weeks Members of the Conservative party have much more to fear from the Prime Minister than Members of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain Members of the Conservative party; but that only emphasises the point I made earlier that the Prime Minister cannot abide opposition whether it is inside her party, in the Cabinet or outside. That is not a sign of strength and determination it is a sign of great weakness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
I want to specifically mention councillor Richard Nicholls who, through his local government service, will be able to maintain contact with democratic local government. I emphasise the word "democratic" because I have many arguments with friends in the City about the role of the City corporation. Although it is democratic in its own terms, to those who take a more objective view of democracy the City can scarcely be described as a democratic institution. I hope to develop that point later but at the moment it is not germane to the amendment. Councillor Richard Nicholls is well versed in trade union history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to mention Louis Bondy—an antiquarian bookseller and a long-serving member of the London county council and of the Greater London Council. Again I declare an interest. Louis Bondy has been a friend of mine for many years. He is passionately devoted to the Museum of London. The director will tell anyone who happens to ask that Louis Bondy has a great passion for the museum. If he were removed from the board of governors in the twilight of his life, he would be heartbroken. Even though he did not continue as a serving member of the GLC, we kept him on the board because we knew of his deep and abiding interest in the history of London and especially in the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to say anything unkind about the City of London. As I am about to receive the hospitality of the Lord Mayor at Mansion House, it would be discourteous of me to kick seven bells out of the lack of democracy within the City. My views on that subject are well known. On this occasion, however, courtesy makes it necessary for me to draw a discrete veil, at least until I have lunched with the Lord Mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governors whom I have mentioned have served the museum: well. The continued presence of both the Labour and Tory nominees would preserve the Londonwide dimension and maintain a connection with the democratic structure of Londonwide local government which we are about to lose with the abolition of the Greater London Council but which the next Labour Government are firmly committed to restore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first group of amendments gives us the opportunity to recognise that continuity in civic and public life is derived only through personalities. We are all only too well aware of that fact in the House, especially in terms of the changes in Government and how they occur from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest in that for nearly 10 years I sat in County Hall as a co-opted member of highways and traffic and planning committees. I am sure that Conservative Members share my belief that continuity in the character institutions is ensured by the nature of the personalities involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks at least to delay a transfer in the authority of those who make the appointments. Until now, the appointments have been up to the Greater London Council and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) said, not all appointees are existing members of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
GLC. The ability to appoint is to be transferred from, a publicly accountable body to an ex-officio senior political figure and there might be a new Prime Minister sooner than some might have supposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, I take the point made by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). Public bodies can get up to all sorts of activities, which may be positive, or negative, constructive or destructive. It may be possible to criticise them, but perhaps the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes will agree that if an elected statutory body is accountable for appointments, creation of bodies or voting money, at least its members can be called to' account for their actions. If the electorate believes that members of a statutory body have acted irresponsibly, they can be thrown out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes again criticised the Greater London Council today. I could criticise the GLC under the regime of Sir Horace Cutler, but I shall not do so. The remedy is in the ballot box, either in terms of the personality of someone for whom the elector is voting or in terms of the party which that person represents. There is no such comparable line of accountability when appointments are transferred from corporate public bodies, which are accountable to the electorate, to persons, however eminent they may be or even if they are at the apex of an accountable body such as Parliament. Such people are in a position of personal patronage. For example, the Secretary of State for the Environment appoints members of the London Docklands development corporation. Members of Parliament can only get at the members of the board through the Secretary of State, who is accountable to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which the elector in Newham, Richmond or the few electors in the City of London can get at the board of governors at the Museum of London will be through the accountability of the Prime Minister in the House. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that such accountability is superior or comparable to that which exists in the London borough of Richmond and Twickenham? I suspect not. Surely the accountability of the GLC and its predecessor, the LCC, was much better than that suggested in the Bill. We want to keep the present system going, at least for a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only to consider how the present incumbent of the Prime Minister's post uses her position of patronage in a way that has been unprecedented since the war. The chairman and the vice-chairman of the BBC are of one political colour for the first time. The London borough of Finchley could be over-weighty on the board of governors at the Museum of London if the present incumbent of Finchley were responsible for appointments. There has clearly been over-dredging from that source in respect of important public offices, including appointments to the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) explained how the GLC
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
and the LCC have played an important part in London's history. That fact alone justifies a period of overlap. Few people remember that London local government started not with the London county council but with the Metropolitan board of works. The history of London has been rooted in a great deal of local government. Those who have had experience in London local government will realise that municipal history has formed a great deal of the life of London. Perhaps I should declare an interest because I have given as a permanent loan to the GLC's archives of London the documents that I gathered about the Greater London council's fight against the ringways. I do not think that those documents will be displayed in the Museum of London. The GLC archives will be organised by some other group. However, such documents illustrate how things did not happen. They are part and parcel of municipal history. During my membership of the GLC and of the House, I have had opportunities to look up some of that history, such as the Conservative administration of the tramways, the controversy of the steamboat service which was introduced by the progressives and destroyed by municipal reformers in 1906, and so on. I believe that those who have had experience in the GLC should retain some input temporarily in the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) referred to Sir Ashley Bramall, who is one of the most experienced members of the GLC. It may be, provided you-know-who agrees, that the Minister could reappoint Sir Ashley Bramall to continue to contribute to the Museum of London. He is eminently suitable because he was a member of the staff sub-committee which has already received praise about the quality of staff. We are back to personalities and the quality of people who are full-time administrators of such institutions. I can think only of the clerks of this House—the silent service—who are so important. Sir Ashley has had long experience both in municipal life and the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a period of overlap because those with experience in the municipal life of London would be able to continue to contribute without undue interference from the person who is responsible for their appointment. We are legislating for a long time ahead. I do not suppose that there will be another Museum of London Bill or, indeed, a Museum of London (Amendment) Bill for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the next Museum of London Bill will be in about two years because when we win the next election we shall bring the museum back under more democratic control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend corrects me. Of course, a change of Government would adjust the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that at about the third or fourth level down in a Government Department, somebody scratches his head because he must appoint people to the Museum of London. We all know what happens when a trawl goes out to the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
and papers are carted home in one of the red boxes in a car that sweeps out of New Palace yard. The Minister Wearily goes through the box and says, "Yes, dear, I'll come to bed in a minute. I must check the people to be appointed to the Museum of London."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That list will eventually reach the Prime Minister of the day, along with all the other matters in the red box. There will either be immediate agreement or a list of patronage posts may be drawn up by someone in No. 11 or No. 10 Downing Street who looks at forthcoming vacancies and nominates certain people for such posts. We shall return to the position in previous centuries if the Bill goes through unamended. That will be a step backwards for democracy and common sense. Knowing the Minister's common sense, I hope that he will consider the merits of our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have presented an excellent case so I shall keep my remarks brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that GLC nominees will remain on the board of governors of the Museum of London. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) said, there should be a period of overlap until proper arrangements are made to restore that necessary local democracy link. The present arrangement of representatives from the City, the GLC and the Government should remain rather than the Government's proposals that there should be nine representatives nominated by the Government and the City, with the GLC representation ceasing from 1 April. There should be nominees from the GLC because they are skilled in their role, take their duties seriously and have done an excellent job so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour representatives on the board will be aware of those elements of London history which the City of London burghers and Government representatives will tend to ignore, such as the history of the labour and trade union movements. They struggled to improve not only working conditions but social conditions. Such efforts will be ignored because they will not be seen as being politically acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contributions from great thinkers in London, such as William Morris, Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells and so on may be put to the back of the queue because their work may be seen as having a Socialist tinge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an enormous struggle for improvements in social conditions by Londoners, for example, in the fight against poverty. There has been considerable immigration by the Jewish, West Indian and Asian communities. That history is likely to be lost to the museum's programme if the new board of governors takes a narrow view, which it could do under the proposed arrangements. The City of London has a well-known reputation for being very parochial and immigrants' contribution to London's history might be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women have made a massive contribution to London's history and a great deal of the "herstory" of London has been lost. Women in all walks of life have made magnificent contributions that have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
not been recognised. Those contributions are likely to continue to be unrecognised unless there are GLC representatives on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boroughs have also contributed to London's history. Many ordinary Londoners have become councillors because of their desire to improve London. In my constituency some local councillors who are still active party members have made great strides to improve the social infrastructure and conditions in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking only about the present troubles, although they should have a place in the museum. The GLC has played a significant part in the contemporary history of London, whatever one's view of the present council, and has brought about great improvements. Some people would argue about those improvements; nevertheless the GLC has played an important role and has a place in a museum of London. The struggles of other councils, usually Labour councils such as Poplar council which struggled against the cuts affecting working people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be interested to know that I have just seen a reproduction of the famous Poplar banner with the Lambeth and Liverpool councillors who have been dragged into court this morning for defending jobs and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying from the amendment and perhaps into the next one. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would speak more closely to the amendment under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I will not go down that path, although it is part of the contemporary history of London and should be reflected in a museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is a period of overlap much of London's history will be excluded from the record presented by the City of London and Government representatives on the board. That would be wrong and makes the case for the GLC nominees remaining on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak about the necessity of maintaining a local democratic link. The City of London and Government nominees cannot speak for ordinary Londoners in the 32 London boroughs. Only a London-wide authority can do so. The City of London owns forest land in my constituency. It is a devil of a job to obtain changes or improvements when the City of London has overall control. That will apply to the new board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government already have an inbuilt Conservative majority on the governing body with the Government and City of London representatives. But the Government not only want that inbuilt majority, they want only Conservatives on that governing body. It is said that the Government want to' crush opposition views on the way in which the museum should be run. As a result, only a very narrow view of London's history will ever be presented. There will be no exhibitions that include Labour party history and its wider relevance to London's history. Exhibitions will be confined to the City of London's
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
narrow interests. There will not be wider publicity arrangements. The museum should appeal more to ordinary Londoners. More than 90 per cent, of Londoners do not even know of the museum's existence. There should be effective publicity arrangements and appealing exhibitions to attract people to it. However, that will not be the case if there are no representatives to argue for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have encouraged museums to introduce charges—I do not know whether that applies to the Minister and perhaps he will give his views later. That is controversial because people who cannot afford the charges are excluded from seeing exhibitions of their own culture. That issue is controversial politically and among those involved in the administration of museums and the arts. The new governing body may have to consider that matter and if there is no opposition on the board there will be no opportunity for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible to retain the present arrangements for an overlapping period until local democratic accountability can be introduced into the new arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Luce)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before replying to this important debate, perhaps it would be in order for me to refer to the tragic death of my hon.

I know that he was keenly interested in the Museum of London Bill. I believe that I am speaking for all hon.

I also wish to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) for referring to my appointment as a Privy Councillor.

The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) moved the amendment before Christmas and because of the discussion this morning we must remind ourselves what the amendment sought to achieve. Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 would result in the present six GLC appointed members of the board of governors being reappointed for a further three-year term starting on 1 April 1986, which is the abolition date of the GLC, and the number of governors appointed by the Prime Minister and the city corporation being kept to six each rather than increased to nine each.

Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) challenged me on that issue, but the reasons for the changes proposed in the Bill stem from the overwhelming majority decision of Parliament to abolish the GLC on 1 April 1986 and from the new funding arrangements to be made for the Museum of London.

Before developing that further, different motives from' Opposition Members for moving the amendment have arisen. The hon. Member for Paisley, South said that the amendment sought to preserve the present arrangement for six GLC nominees until such time as his party had formed a Government and had re-established the GLC. The hon. Gentleman further implied that all that would happen—he reinforced drat view in an intervention this morning—in the next two years. The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised that I do not join him in seeing that great vision of the future, or that my hon. Friends will not embark on a joint venture with him in this objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be absurd for the Committee to draft legislation on the basis that in two years the will of Parliament will be different and might be the opposite of what it is now. Personally, I believe that in two years' time policies will be totally consistent with present attitudes. In any event, it does not make sense to anticipate what might happen in two years' time. Therefore, we should put aside that objective and look at other points raised this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the change, and why the Committee should reject the amendment, is that the GLC will be abolished on 1 April 1986 and we must make new funding arrangements. If we fulfil the objective of the amendment, to whom would the six appointees be responsible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop my arguments and answer the points made by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are devising an arrangement for appointments by the Prime Minister and the City corporation which are designed to relate to the new funding arrangements which feature in the Bill whereby half the cost should be funded by the Government and half by the City corporation. Surely it makes sense to have power that goes with responsibility and the responsibility of funding—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Newham, North-West should let me develop this argument because I shall be answering some of the anxieties about continuity and representation of the wider area. Therefore, it makes sense to devise a system where the Government and the City corporation make those appointments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene to make a specific point on that issue? The nominees put forward by the Miinster will be Government nominees. They will probably not be Government Ministers or Members of Parliament and therefore will not have a direct relationship to Government and their funding of the museum. The GLC is one of the museum's founders and only includes three members of the GLC on its board. The other three are not members of the GLC. If the GLC can do that, why will the Government not do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That demonstrates my very argument. If I had not given way I could have developed
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
my arguments about the importance of those appointed to the Museum of London board in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attach great importance to what I am about to say, which is a reiteration of what I said on Second Reading. The Prime Minister and the City corporation—I can speak on this issue on behalf of the City corporation—will certainly bear in mind the Londonwide nature of the Mueum of London and I cannot stress that too strongly. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes joined with Opposition Members in asking for such a reassurance and to a considerable extent that has already been demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shocked by suggestions from the hon. Members for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) and for Newham, North-West that corruption exists in the appointment of nominees to various boards of museums and trustees of museums. I deplore and condemn such unwarranted remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the composition of the trustees, not only of the present board of the Museum of London —all admirable people who are dedicated to their jobs—we find people who are not paid anything other than travel expenses. Opposition Members know that perfectly well and to suggest that corruption exists should be condemned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is a complete misconception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members never intended to impugn any corruption. The Minister has misunderstood the thrust of our arguments. We are dealing with a principle and would ask the Minister particularly to address himself to giving the Committee a reassurance about the range of the appointments that he intends to make. I am sure that the Minister recognises that in the interests of Greater London. Opposition Members hope that he will appoint London people to those posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is aware that a number of the present governors of the museum do not have strong links with London and live in such places as Sussex, East Sussex, Dorking and Aylesbury. Those people have not been appointed by the GLC. If the Minister wishes to reassure the Committee he should give an undertaking that he will make it a requirement that the Government and the City appointees will be London residents who are involved in the life of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman paid tribute to two existing members of the board of governors of the Museum of London—Simon Jenkins and Professor Valerie Pearl. At least one of those admirable members of the board—Professor Pearl—was appointed by the Labour Government in 1977 I believe, and was reappointed by the Prime Minister. In answer to the allegation that the Prime Minister does not have regard to continuity and the wider interests, surely that reappointment shows that she does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reaffirm the clear undertaking that the Prime Minister and the City corporation will have strong regard to the Londonwide interests of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Furthermore, the amendment suggests that all GLC members who are serving now should continue to serve for another three years. I ask the Committee to reject that amendment. But, without giving a firm commitment, because it would not be right for me to do so yet when various new appointments must be made to the Museum of London. I can say that I would not preclude the possible appointment of one or two people who may have served or who are serving now as GLC-appointed members. I cannot and will not give a specific undertaking but I do not preclude that possibility as a contribution to the future work of the museum. I hope that that will show that I have listened with care to the arguments. The appointees need to be people of the best possible calibre who will do a good job to strengthen the interests of the Museum: of London, taking into account its Londonwide interests. I am sure that I can say that that is the sole aspect about which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister please explain the reason for increasing the number from six to nine? Is the increase in management required because the museum is not being run properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increase is simple to explain. It flows from the decision to abolish the GLC. As hitherto 18 have been nominated to the board, up to the time when I hope that the Bill will be enacted, one-third of those 18 will have been nominated by the GLC, one-third by the City Corporation and one-third by the Prime Minister. Because of the abolition of the GLC and the new funding arrangements, there must be an adjustment in terms of the appointments. As the Bill would give the Government half the funding responsibility and the City corporation the other half, each could appoint nine to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to explain the Government's purpose in the appointment of high calibre people to the Museum of London board. I pay tribute to the excellent service hitherto provided by the members of the board, whether GLC, City or Government appointees. The members are of the highest calibre. We are lucky to have them. A good precedent has been set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the background and my explanation of our policy, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend not to be disappointed. The speeches from my hon. Friends have been convincing. The amendment could have been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that my reason for tabling the amendment was different from that of my hon. Friends. It is not. The Minister said that we should not anticipate the future. He argued that our proposition to leave well alone because there could be a change of Government in two years' time could not be tolerated because legislation cannot be based on anticipation, but it can. The purpose of intelligent legislation is to try to anticipate and to shape the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now abundantly clear, especially after the events of the past few days, that the Government will
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
not be in office in a couple of years, so it is even more important to preserve the position. Indeed, the Government may be in office for only months, not years. A week is a long time in politics. The past 24 hours have shown that sometimes a day is a long time in politics. In the interest of continuity the Government should leave well alone by leaving the members of the board as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not reiterate the arguments. We wish to make progress. But, in view of the Minister's assurance about the Londonwide nature of the museum, we cannot accept that there will be no members on the board who reflect the democratic will or even reflect the general position of the people of London. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) mentioned social history. He omitted to mention public health development within London. Members who reflect such views should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept that appointments made by the Prime Minister above all, by this Prime Minister and appointments made by the City above all, by this City—can in any sense reflect the attitudes of people in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman believe that it is impossible for people appointed to the board to be incapable of considering the issues that he mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one has said that necessarily they would be incapable. [HON. MEMBERS: "Less likely."] My hon. Friends suggest that they would be less likely to do so. I agree. The experience of the past two or three years shows that the Prime Minister does not have an especially broad concept of her appointments. Of course, there will be chinks in the armour. Good governors will get through. But, fewer appointees from the Prime Minister or the City will accept, for example, the full concept defined by my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton. It would be a fluke and pure luck if it happened; and we would welcome it if it did. Our proposal would ensure that it would and that is why we seek continuity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, one of the board's main functions will be to control finance. There is little doubt that some City representatives will think in terms of bigger purchases and more prestigious purposes rather than the small sums needed for developing social history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one wants appointments to be political in the sense meant by Conservative Members. It is strange that anything done by the Labour party is seen by Conservative Members as political whereas anything done by the Tory party is seen mostly as non-political. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) illustrated that point in his definition of "political". Of course, the Museum of London must have a political aspect because politics form the source and thrust of history, but the museum should have no connection with politics in terms of the Government's narrow and reactionary view of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
I am disappointed that some of the points have not been accepted, but I thank the Minister for accepting one point. He said that without commitment he would not preclude the possible appointment of some existing members. I hope that that means that the right hon. Gentleman is considering the main thrust of some of our arguments. We shall press the amendment to a division. We wish to move on to other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong of me not to congratulate the Minister on his elevation to Privy Councillor. The previous Minister for the Arts was a Lord. At least the present one is in the House of Commons. We must be grateful for small mercies. Perhaps the Minister's elevation to Privy Councillor reflects the fact that the Prime Minister has begun to recognise the problem. I hope that the Minister will accept that when Opposition Members referred to corruption, it was not related to the museum but was about corruption that sometimes can stem from elsewhere. I hope that the Members will recognise that and does not fall into any trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, we should be careful when we reject that type of comment when we are dealing with the City. I believe that all today's business in the House of Commons will cover the problems that have arisen from the peculiar nature of our financial institutions. However, Opposition Members are genuinely pleased about the honour which the Minister has received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I must join the Minister and Committee Members in being saddened by the unexpected death of the honourable Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens). I knew him, too. He was courageous in many ways. His death will be a loss to the Tory party and, indeed, to the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will soon conclude the discussion of the amendment and I hope that it is not out of the spirit of the debate to take up one point that the Minister made. We may not have another opportunity in Committee, or in the House, to raise the issue, which will be of specific importance to his Department. The Minister quite properly referred to the use of the word "corruption", and I wish to suggest various important points in that regard. I believe that the issue is within the ambit of the amendment because of the transfer the making of appointments from a publicly-elected body to a political personage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the Prime Minister and Ministers of all Departments must appoint people to important administrative posts and to public office, such as to the board of governors of the Museum of London. I believe that the sensitivities of Opposition Members rest on two issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, those people should be appointed for their ability to contribute to the public function which they then fulfil. It is not primarily a party function. It crosses all parties. They should be appointed because of their known characteristics, their track performance and the confidence which all groups of
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
the community have in them because of their qualities and ability to contribute to whatever authority to which they are appointed. But when the experience of those appointed does not seem to tally with their expected contribution, the reasons for their appointment are questioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second criterion relates to when there is, or is thought to be, a conflict of interest by virtue of an appointment, although I do not think that that applies to the Museum of London. There is not a great deal of decision-making on that board which could cause such a conflict. However, the opposite applies to the London Docklands development corporation where matters of property are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the sensitivities of my hon. Friends arise because they believe that when there is a transfer from public appointment to one of appointment by political personage, for example, to a Minister, the other issues should be borne in mind. Unfortunately, the present Administration do not seem to bear those sensitivities in mind as much as we would wish. However, when those matters arise, I have complete confidence that the present Minister will act within criteria similar to those that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in Clause 1, page 1, line 10, leave out from second ' date' to end of line 14 and insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have argued for continuity, but we have been told that that does not make sense because ILEA will not be responsible to anyone. We argued that ILEA would be responsible for past appointments and its representatives after the GLC had been abolished. The Minister must accept that there should be an element of accountability in appointments to the board. The rejection of our first amendment makes the case for amendment No. 2. If the Minister cannot accept our first amendment because he believes that the group of six people will be unaccountable since the body to which they are accountable now will no longer exist, he is by definition seeking the accountability of at least half a dozen members of the new board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
of governors. He has stripped away that accountability by leaving it in the gift of the Prime Minister and the City of London corporation. The City of London is accountable only to itself because two-thirds of its electorate do not even live in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the GLC is to be abolished, no democratic body will represent London as a whole. If there is to be no such body, we should try to find a body that is most representative of London. The only remaining body most representative must be ILEA. It does not cover the whole of London, defined by the Minister in this context as the London-wide nature of the museum. ILEA is not London-wide. That is not our fault. We did not abolish the GLC. We are trying our best to shore up a bad job. At least ILEA represents between one third and one half of London and is an elected and democratic body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ILEA has an interest in museums, particularly the Museum of London that should be based upon the history and social background of London and its effect upon the present. No one knows what will happen to the museum under the new regime. Museums are strongly related to education, and exhibitions should form an integral part of education in London. The best body to represent London on a democratic basis must be ILEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between ILEA and members of the GLC, who have worked so much for the Museum of London and who have helped to develop the arts within London, must continue. As our first amendment has fallen, we must look for an alternative that should have a democratic basis, and the best approach is to suggest members of ILEA. The reasons why are ILEA'S London representation, its relationship to education and its accountability. There is no reason why ILEA should not be represented on the board of governors. I can see every reason why it should be if the GLC no longer has any representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right for me to declare a past interest. For 14 years before I became a Member of Parliament I was an employee of, first, the London county council and then the Inner London education authority. Some of the practical examples outlined by my honourable Friend come within my personal experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise that ILEA would be the best body to represent London. While ILEA does not represent all London, it is the best core-London elected representative body. Honourable Members may say that it is not all-purpose like the GLC, but we must remember that education covers a wide spectrum of endeavour and knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how many Conservative Members are acquainted with ILEA or with its predecessor, the London county council education service. It provides a national service which is locally administered. It does not cover only schools. It covers much more than that, such as adult education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The slogan, "He has gone to LCC evening classes "was very attractive and effective. Millions of people attended evening classes, not only for
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
leisure purposes, but to learn technical subjects and crafts which would lead to employment. The LCC and ILEA ran many institutions relating to skills and professions, many of which were concerned with the economy of London. The City of London relies on many institutions run by ILEA. The furniture, building and catering trades rely heavily on that core educational system. Therefore, ILEA covers much more than school education; it trains teachers and prepares people for certain occupations and leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, ILEA represents a slice of life with which almost every aspect of London life is connected as well as fulfilling its specific purpose of education. It has a wide scope and should have representatives on the board of governors of the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members will say that there is nothing to prevent the board of governors from co-operating with ILEA and I have no doubt that they will do so. School visits will be arranged as before, but those were probably facilitated by members currently appointed by the GLC. For those who do not know of our somewhat unusual arrangements in London, all GLC members from inner London are ex officio members of ILEA. Sir Ashley Bramall is a prime example of someone who encompasses both spheres assisting the co-operation that exists between those two bodies. Experience shows how useful commonality of appointment can be. I am not suggesting that ILEA members should displace all those to be appointed by the Government and the City, but there should be representation and I hope that some further thought will be given to that idea. Perhaps the actual number—I am not asking for a large number—could be inserted in the Bill as a trace element that would be healthy and helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is changing rapidly. I am sure that all of us in Committee were educated in the tradition of minimum visual display. The blackboard was the main means of demonstration and, if we were lucky, there were a few filmstrips, although that did not really happen until the 1950s and 1960s. Now everyone is stimulated by the visual arts—television and videos—but they have their limitations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tactile demonstration is equally important. I am sure that the Museum of London will expand its activities and further integrate them with all aspects of the London educational service, including the arts. I refer to the history of theatre and all the other matters for which the Minister is responsible. Such cross-representation would assist not only the education service but would maintain and improve the reputation of the Museum of London. That would be mutually advantageous and would offer great advantages to the citizens of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be denied that ILEA is a democratically elected authority. At present, nominations are taking place for representatives to serve on that body. I know that thousands
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
of people are getting together to select their nominees. That will result in a democratically elected authority known as the Inner London education authority which will carry considerable responsibility and the faith of those living in London. It will be responsible for the education of children and adults who will be the main visitors to the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said by my honourable Friends, the museum is an important part of the education service in London. My wife is a teacher and arranges for children to visit such museums. I ask the Minister not to remove ILEA's right and opportunity to nominate governors to the Museum of London. Who could be better than ILEA representatives on the board of governors? They can offer advice on how best to run the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister conceded that the democratically elected representatives of the GLC played an excellent role in helping to control the Museum of London. All that we ask is that a similarly democratically elected body, such as ILEA, should continue that responsibility. If that is refused, the Minister will be denying the right of the citizens of London from having a direct say in the control of that museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ILEA will be composed of different political views and will represent the broad views of those living in London who will be the main users of the Museum of London. That is in contrast to the City of London. I need not say much about the saga of the Westland aircraft company and the antics of people in the City of London. Such behaviour does not happen in ILEA or the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The faith of the electorate—those who pay rates and taxes and make a strong financial contribution to what takes place in London—is required. They should have a say in the running of the museum which would be best done through a body such as ILEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the two amendments are in my name, I have some problems with them because the Minister may say that they have been defectively drafted and so do not have their intended impact. But they allow us to debate two crucial points which are worthy of consideration, namely the importance of democratic involvement and, in particular, the importance of educational involvement. I shall be grateful if the Minister will treat these as probing amendments and take the opportunity to comment on both points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the democratic aspect of the intention behind the amendments, I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) has admirably expressed the Opposition's viewpoint and I shall not say much more about that. The Minister now has a clear view that the desirability to have some democratically accountable involvement of governors should be of paramount importance to the Government and to those involved with the museum. We have covered the democratic arguments well enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
There are one or two things to be said about the educational aspects and, again, I am in some difficulty about amendment No. 2 because, as my hon. Friend has already recognised, ILEA does not cover the whole of Greater London and we have gone to great lengths in previous amendments to impress upon the Minister the importance of the involvement and concern of the City. I recognise that ILEA is deficient because it represents only approximately one third of the people in Greater London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there are drafting weaknesses in the amendments but they are the best we can do given the conventions of Committee procedure and the Bill's cryptic nature. If the Minister will accept them as probing amendments, perhaps he can explain his views about the importance of education in the development of the museum and its policy. When the Minister, and his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister appoint governors I hope that he will positively recognise the importance of education and, particularly, modern trends in historical education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The historical education which most Committee members received at school is a thing of the past. History meant kings, queens, Governments, the development of parliament and great national events, particularly those which were constitutional and legislative of any age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being a father himself, the Minister does not need Opposition Members to remind him of the work that now goes into CSEs, O and A levels. Times have completely changed in the teaching of history, and the roots of that change may not be very welcome to Conservative Members. They undoubtedly go back to the critical historical perspective of Karl Marx and the idea that it is the groundswell of ordinary people's lives and of economic and work trends that create the inevitability of change in society rather than the dynamic being created by legislators, the law or other established hierarchies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the roots of historical change are unwelcome to some Conservative Members, undoubtedly the present trends in historical education have been accepted by historians of all party political persuasions in recent years. Nowadays the importance in ordinary people's lives of culture in its widest sense of songs, work, practices, purchases, commerce, trading, health, housing and so on is accepted by historians of all political persuasions as the essence of history. If that is true of the content, it is equally true of the method by which history is taught, and it is in that area that museums such as the Museum- of London have a crucial part to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers of history, which is embodied in the syllabuses of CSE, O and A levels, recognise the crucial importance of primary sources for the development of historical understanding. Museums such as the Museum of London must recognise and follow through in their planning and acquisition policies in the future the importance of collecting elements of present life in London now, as much as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
collecting elements of the past, and be able to embody them' in a living archive. Children who are studying immediate past history, fairly distant past history, or today's history will then have access to those primary sources. It is in that context that the Museum of London has a vital part to play, which is why it is important that the education element is kept in the forefront of the Government's mind in their attitude towards the museum and its board of governors. The museum will be more remembered as a tool and an opportunity for teaching our children about life as it was lived in London.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South said, the Minister might say that he recognised the importance of education and that the museum's record was good—in showing visual displays, providing material and working with ILEA and London schools and that he would do his best to ensure that that work continued. If the Minister responds in that way, we shall certainly welcome it. However, those assurances would be given more force and substance if the intention behind them were embodied in the selection of future governors whose primary concern was the development of education and the teaching of our history to future generations. That does not apply only to the work which is done on school visits and educational packs, which should be developed. It is essential that the development of the museum's strategy, its acquisition policy and the amount of money that will be needed to finance those developments are kept within an educational framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that if a significant number of non-educationists gain dominance on the board of governors, their policy will be tailored solely to the money available. The board of governors will not contain people to argue for the expensive needs of educational acquisitions in advance of the budget requests. If the Minister has sympathy for the educational vision of Opposition Members for the future of the museum, he must recognise that that is not a cheap policy. If the range of present-day material, let alone historical material that the museum could and should develop is to be assured and is accessible to children and adults in further education and curated in a professional manner, it will be extremely expensive. Although, we shall come later to the funding of the museum, I believe that that will demand greatly enhanced funding. Only if educationists are well-established on the board of governors will there be a chance of arguing for such a future direction and strategy before budgets are set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that he attaches great importance to education. The only way in which he can satisfactorily give that assurance to the Committee and the people involved with the museum is to accept that nominees from ILEA are essential to ensure the closest possible links between ILEA and the museum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Welwyn Hatfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I register my objection to special representation from ILEA? Opposition Members have already defeated their own case by admitting that
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
ILEA represents only part of the Greater London area. We are discussing a museum of London, not a museum of inner London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If various bodies are selected to have representation on the board there will be no end. One might ask, "Why stay within the confines of London?" Many people in the country will be interested in the high standards of the museum and will wish to visit it. In my constituency, which is only 20 miles from London, many people are interested in what happens in London. Why should not they have a representative on the board of governors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was raised on Second Reading and Opposition Members have not yet taken the matter on board. To go a stage further, we hope that there will be many overseas tourists to this country. They will benefit from visiting the museum but they could not be adequately represented on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be more realistic if, as I said on Second Reading, the system envisaged in the Bill is accepted and that the board is composed of people who have the best interests of the museum at heart. We should not get involved in the political arguments which Opposition Members are trying to raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) said when introducing the amendment, the purpose is to provide for the six vacancies created by clause 1 to be filled by appointees of the Inner London Education Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the tone of the debate. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) suggested that this should be a probing amendment. However, that is a decision for Opposition Members. The hon. Member said that he was concerned principally with the links between the museum and educational authorities in London and the composition of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been previous debates on that issue. There was a full debate on the Local Government Bill 1985 about whether ILEA should be represented. The arguments were considered thoroughly then and there is no reason why we should do so again although the hon. Gentleman has chosen to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with hon. Members who have a keen interest in education that all museums have an important link with the educational world. The Museum of London rightly welcomes school and other educational parties, but it is not primarily an educational institution as are, for example, the Geffrye and Horniman museums. Those museums have a stronger educational link and the Ministry's arrangements for them will be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy) made the point effectively that, quite apart from the broader arguments, ILEA represents only 12 out of 32 boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy). Is not ILEA the most widely representative body in London part from the GLC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to the concept of ILEA having an important role. My hon. Friend said that ILEA represents 12 out of the 32 boroughs. I must reiterate the principle that the responsibility for the appointment of members of the board of the Museum of London must be linked to those who are paying the costs of the museum. If we stick to that principle—and I reassure hon. Members that the Prime Minister and the corporation will have regard to the Londonwide nature of the museum—we are ensuring the continuance of those important educational links about which hon. Gentlemen are so concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) said that involvement in education should be reflected in the composition of the board. I agree that that is important. Two members of the board, appointed by the Prime Miinster, have strong educational links. I refer to Professor Pearl and Professor Wilkes. That shows the Prime Minister's concern for the educational aspects of the musuem. I assure the Committee that the Prime Minister will continue to have firm regard for that important interest. However, it would not be right to go further than that, and if we did, it would break the very firm principles of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee agrees that my assurances go far enough to meet die anxieties about the need to reflect the concern for representing educational interests. With that in mind, perhaps me hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might have considered that but for the Minister's reply and the intervention made by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy), who said that our amendment was insufficient and did not go far enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. He said that his constituents, living 20 miles from the centre of London, were interested and mat they should be represented. I agree absolutely. We will support any amendments for wider representation to cover the suburbs and Home Counties. We welcome any allies who will help us to find a way to make the board of governors more representative and more accountable than at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the ILEA is much more representative than the City of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. We are seeking some means, as I thought that the hon. Member for Welwyn and Hatfield was, by which the people of London can be represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as ever, restates another hon. Member's argument in a totally opposite fashion. I made my view clear about the facetious approach adopted by the Opposition in trying to press a political point. I also made it plain that I agree with die Ministerial approach of appointing nominees who would widely take into account die Greater London requirements. The hon. Gentleman cannot twist what I said to support his own argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am terribly disappointed. I am trying to be nice to the hon. Gentleman but I am being abused. I am accused of being facetious. Our argument is not about the nominees but about who makes the appointments. We are trying to ensure that the bodies who make those appointments are, as far as we can achieve within the strictures of the Bill, more representative of the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
