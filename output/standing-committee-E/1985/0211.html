	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Financial Services Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. It will not have escaped your attention that Conservative Members have received a considerable volume of paper concerning representations from organisations. Also, in view of the regular attendance of so many Conservative Members, would it be possible to move to a larger Committee Room?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member has raised that point. Although I cannot decide such a matter myself, I have brought it to the attention of the authorities. I was so appalled the first time that the Committee met in this Room that I asked for steps to be taken to ensure that when another Room was vacant we could move to it. I am fortified by the Committee's response to the hon. Gentleman's point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNITION OF SELF-REGULATING ORGANISATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 153, in page 135, line 32, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"and in particular whether the person is honest, competent and solvent".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 154, in page 137, line 3, after "dealing", insert "and competence".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest in the amendment is that the people who run the SROs will be at the heart of how the SROs will operate. I am anxious that the Committee should consider carefully the definition of a " fit and proper " person, because that, in conjunction with amendment No. 154, which imports the notion of competence, is what the unsuspecting member of the public may be most interested in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot legislate to deal with all contingencies, but, by the same token, it is important to devise proper criteria. The phrase "fit and proper person", which I wish to be included by reference to what is contained on page 2 of " Regulation of Investment Business: The New Framework " published in December 1985 by the SIB, could be further defined as "honest, competent and solvent ". I do not expect that definition to be conclusive as it does not embrace all the criteria, and clause 26 provides that
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State may take into account any matter".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
I do not wish to spend too long on my argument, but it is important to get this right. Section 3 of the Insolvency Act 1985 deals with the test for a "fit and proper" person. The most important part of the provision is the requirement that in addition to being "fit and proper persons", people who are to be insolvency practitioners must
	<br><q><p>" meet acceptable requirements as to education and practical training and experience."</p></q>
That is, in effect, the competence test that my amendment refers to. It is as relevant to the provision of financial services as it is, for example, to the provision of licensing services under the recently enacted Administration of Justice Act 1985. I served on the Standing Committee of that Bill with at least one of my hon. Friends and perhaps two Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only people who are "honest, competent and solvent " should be allowed—licensed, controlled or regulated—to provide services, as the SIB also recommended. Moreover, there should be a proper test of competence. If amendment No. 154 were accepted, paragraph 7 of schedule 2 would provide:
	<br><q><p>" The organisation must be able and willing to promote and maintain high standards of integrity and fair dealing and competence ".</p></q>
However reasonable we may seek to be, we must meet the bottom line in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that the expression "fit and proper persons " already includes the criteria that I mentioned, but it would be as plain as a pikestaff to anyone, lawyer or non-lawyer, that the provisions of the SIB document would not necessarily be imported into the individual rules of each SRO. I am anxious that proper guidelines should be given and that they should be provided by Parliament, not just referred to by the SRO at its own whim, as will happen if the amendment is not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constitutional question of what is contained in the memorandum and articles of association, whether limited by guarantee or other arrangement, will be prescribed by the SRO. It is important to get the criteria right in the legislation for the sake of members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell on Rex v. The High Justices, 1912, No. 1 King's Bench Division, because I should rapidly bore the Committee, but I want to place it on record because it deals with the definition of a "fit and proper" person. It is abundantly clear, as a matter of law, that there is no fixed definition of a "fit and proper" person, which could cause a lot of argument about its meaning. In simple language, I want to ensure that Parliament gets the definition right in the legislation. I see no reason why my amendment should not be accepted, and I intend to press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with some sympathy to the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), as I hope the Minister did. I cannot promise that we shall support the hon. Gentleman in a Division, but I hope that the Minister will note my general expression of interest and my sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
I am a little bemused by the hon. Gentleman's citation of the 1912 case, but, in view of the general principal and the fact that so much that we need to examine lies outside the Bill, it is a good idea to try to bring as much as possible within the Bill. I would rather see the definition, and those glosses on what a " fit and proper person " should mean, brought from the SIB document into the body of the Bill. I shall look forward with interest to the Minister's comments on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am not a lawyer, I do not know whether " fit and proper " includes a test of competence, but if there is any doubt about the matter, I urge the Minister to include a definition of competence. If people are to be permitted to carry on this sort of activity, it is vital for them to be competent in the field in which they are practising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) on introducing the amendment, which we should include in the Bill. It poses a problem in the sense that it imposes a stricter test than would be imposable on Cabinet membership under the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in dealing with financial institutions, it is right that the test should be made explicit. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that we are trying to incorporate in the Bill as many as possible of the regulations and guidelines—which we do not want to leave to be drawn up afterwards, with a more lax and accommodating approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us spell it out in the Bill, especially in respect of the problem of incorporating Lloyd's in the measure; Opposition Members will continue to> press that point. Indeed, if the test were applied to Lloyd's as a self-regulating organisation, one wonders what changes it would produce in the management of that orginsation. If the test had been incorporated in the provisions for self-regulating organisations, I cannot see that Sir Peter Green's inquiry into Unimar would have been tenable, in view of the implication of several of his friends in the scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amendment especially, because of the provisions which it foreshadows for Lloyd's when we come to include that organisation in the Bill, but it is of more general importance for other SROs. I shall say no more on the matter, because that would anticipate remarks that we shall wish to make later in respect of amendment No. 93 and amendment No. 155, proposed by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), when we examine the broader implications of the measure. The test is important, and should be incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the concern which has led my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) to put forward the two amendments, and I understand the support which he has obtained from other Committee members. Clearly, the matters are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
On the basis of the case to which my hon. Friend referred, I also accept that there is no fixed definition of the term "fit and proper". The definition of that term depends on the context in which it is found. In this context, the test provided under the Bill—whether the applicant is " fit and proper " to carry on the business in question—covers the matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford has drawn attention, and, indeed, other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An SRO will not be eligible for recognition unless, in applying the test, it has regard to the capital resources that the applicant proposes to devote to the business; the competence, qualifications, experience and honesty of people who will be running the business or occupy key positions; and to the applicant's ability to comply with the SRO's rules. If it is not satisfied about any of those matters, it must refuse membership. If we single out one requirement, such as that to which my hon. Friend referred, we may imply that we shall not take into account other important requirements, which are not specified. A Latin maxim epitomises that point, but I shall not burden the Committee with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister read out a list of additional criteria. Where do they come from? Are they written out somewhere, or are they the views of civil servants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are matters deriving from the context in which the words "fit and proper" are found in the Bill. They offer the best advice I can give the Committee of what would be covered by that formula, in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend refers to the fact that there is only one requirement. I have said that it is the bottom line, and I mentioned also clause 26(3) which refers to "any matter".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not excluding the possibility of other criteria being included; I simply said that there is a bottom line. As I have said in previous sittings, and as my hon. and learned Friend knows, it is not possible for us to have the proceedings of the Committee read out before the courts as an aid to interpretation. Unless there is a bottom line which works, I am worried—by analogy with such matters as licence conveyancing and insolvency practice—that the public might not get proper advice on the very questions on which they need it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not depart one jot from my original proposition, and I do not believe that my hon. and learned Friend's arguments stand the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon. Friend asked a question to which I am expected to give a reply, or made a further contribution. I had not completed my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can see the difference in our views. I suggest that this is not a matter of the bottom line, but of the meaning of the phrase "fit and proper" in this context. Will it include not only competence, which is important and should be included, but other matters? If we include a specific reference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
to competence, do we not run a risk that other important matters will not have to be taken into account? Is not that a danger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully in a genuine attempt to reach a judgment on the merits of the Minister's arguments. However, while the phrase " fit and proper " no doubt encompasses the criteria specified by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) there is, nevertheless, an advantage in specifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Stafford, I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument about a well-known Latin maxim because any court interpreting the provision would concede that however specific some of the requirements are, the general requirement remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There the Committee can see the difference between our views. My hon. Friend is inserting a question mark about matters that are of equal importance to the test of competence. I do not think that the Bill should include that question mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. However, he is presenting us with a lawyer's justification for doing nothing, which is explicable in his position. Even if the Minister rejects the test specified in the amendment of his hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) on those grounds, does he not recognise that there is a problem and will he suggest an alternative form of wording that will satisfy his hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that the formula in the Bill, " fit and proper", when considered in context, as it would be by any court, includes the test of competence that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initial problem is not what the court may say; that will come later. I am anxious about what the individual SROs will do, and the manner in which their members will conduct themselves. The question of what the Bill contains would be examined only when a case came to court, whereas the SRO—which is comprised of its own members—will decide, through its governing body, on certain criteria. I accept that that will be done in conjunction with rules passed down by the SIB, but I maintain that my definition is a reasonable one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow my hon. Friend in that distinction. The SRO will have the benefit of SIB's rules and SIB has made it plain that it will take competence into account. As I understand it, my hon. Friend's point was that that it not good enough and that something is required in the statute. That can only be relevant to an ultimate determination on the matter by the courts and in respect of that, I would suggest that the formula "fit and proper" would give full weight to the inclusion of the test of competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 154 would require a recognised self-regulating organisation to be able and willing to promote high standards of competence as well as integrity and fair dealing. That could, for instance,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
be interpreted as requiring a recognised self-regulating organisation to arrange training courses. It could, therefore, be a different sort of requirement from that to promote high standards of integrity or fair dealing, which can be achieved through rules and enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 of schedule 2 will require a recognised self-regulating organisation to have regard to the competence of its members. If that competence were to fall below a level that the Secretary of State or designated agency considered necessary to provide adequate investor protection, he or it could revoke recognition. I believe that that provides the safeguard that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford seeks and that neither of the amendments is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that technically and legally, neither of the amendments is necessary. However, there is a range of considerations to which I hope my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will give some weight. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has done us a service in inviting us to consider the amendments, particularly amendment No. 153. I have no doubt that the SIB, or any other agency to which the Secretary of State would delegate the powers of regulation, would require that members of SROs satisfy the tests of honesty, competence and solvency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because we have embarked upon a strategy of self-regulation, it is the more important that we take all reasonable steps to reassure investors who may fear—albeit, in my view, unjustly—that the self-regulatory approach will not be tough enough. Therefore, it is important to build their confidence and I believe that where possible, we should modify the phrasing of the legislation to confirm that we are instituting a tough regulatory regime. That would make no difference to the operation of the SIB or of the SROs under it, but it would reassure investors. The Committee should do everything that it can to encourage investors to believe that the regime will be appropriately tough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed with the Minister's reply. He is playing a straight bat to the matter, and holding the line, but what he is seeing is an important phenomenon in the Committee. His own Back Benchers are raising the voice of honest doubt. The hon. Members for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) and for Stafford (Mr. Cash) expressed serious views that are widely held in the Conservative party and by those who believe that the Bill, by embarking on the road of self-regulation, does not provide the safeguards required to give confidence to people outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is reading more into my remarks than is justified. I said explicitly that I believe that the provisions of the Bill are tough enough and that the self-regulatory regime will protect investors. My point was the importance of reassuring investors that that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that where we can make the wording tougher and give more confidence outside, we should do so. The amendment is just such an instance. He has assiduously climbed out from under the implications of his speech. I understand his deferrence to the Government Whips and the terror that he feels—he does not want to get out of line ideologically with his insanities. However, he made a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that we should support the desire of the hon. Member for Stafford to see his wording written into the Bill. That would give courage—and they certainly need it—to those in the Conservative party who want to strengthen the Bill and take a firmer and more independent approach to the problems that are discrediting not only die Government, but the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with increasing interest to the differing points that have been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference that has lead to the dispute is a question of law. I am sure that my hon. Friend die Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) would be the first to agree that when two good-natured lawyers attempt genuinely to find common ground about what the law provides, there ought not to be any real distinction between them. I am prepared to look carefully with my hon Friend at die existing precedents—he has helped the Committee by drawing its attention to one; there are others—to decide on the interpretation to be accorded to the phrase " fit and proper" in its context. If I cannot convince him that, on a reasonable construction of all the precedents, die phrase adequately meets die points to which he has drawn our attention, I shall undertake to consider earnestly me introduction of fresh language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, as ever, fascinated by ministerial statements of mat sort, giving assurances and entering into undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's undertaking can be understood to import necessarily die criteria that I have mentioned—I am choosing my words carefully—I shall withdraw the amendment. The basis for my doing so is that an amendment will be produced on Report that will necessarily import my criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say mat my hon. Friend presses me a trifle too far. He asks for an absolute commitment now that such an amendment will be necessary. I have asked him, in a spirit of good will and reconciliation, to explore the precedents with me. We shall bring forward an amendment if it is considered necessary after mat examination.

	<br><q><p>" and nothing done or omitted in good faith by the organisation or by any officer or servant of the organisation in monitoring and enforcing compliance with such rules and regulations shall give rise to' any liability in damages at the suit of any member of the organisation ".</p></q>
I have particular pleasure in moving the amendment after that welcome demonstration of ministerial open-mindedness and flexibility, which I hope will set a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises an important point about the effectiveness of the SROs in carrying out their functions. The SIB successfully lobbied for a provision that would give it an immunity against suit. That is provided in paragraph 3 of schedule 7. A supervisory authority could not carry out its functions effectively if it was always threatened with legal action because of some supposed libel or breach of confidence. I am glad mat the provision is included as a result of the SIB's successful lobbying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SROs will also be handicapped by such threatened litigation unless they can have similar immunity. I believe that that point is supported by the SIB and by the existing SROs. The amendment seeks to provide the SROs with the same immunity that we recognise as necessary for the SIB. The terms of that immunity will have to be framed with great care. Perhaps my amendment does not do the job with sufficient care; I shall be interested to' hear the Minister's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly motivated, when drafting the amendment, by the example of the Lloyd's Act, which grants specific immunity. It appeared, however, mat Lloyd's might use that immunity as a defence against actions brought by those who had suffered as a result of its failure to supervise. Lloyd's had insisted on a provision in its private Bill which provided it with immunity against suit on the ground mat such immunity was necessary for effective regulation. Lloyd's was tempted to defend itself against a failure to regulate effectively, and might have used the provision to do so. That is most undesirable.

I do not know whether I have distinguished successfully the two types of litigation in. the amendment. My objective is to provide an immunity against suit by members—those who are being regulated—so that they cannot take refuge in the laws of libel and breach of confidence. Investors who depend for their protection on effective regulation by the SRO concerned should be able to sue for negligence and other failure of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made the point of the amendment clear to the Minister and that he will consider it in the sympathetic spirit in which he approached the amendment of his hon. Friend die Member for Stafford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy for the aim of the amendment as stated by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary enjoyed the irony when the hon. Gentleman cited the Lloyd's Act as an example that we should follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am predisposed towards anything that strengthens the arrangements for monitoring and enforcing the rules. The Gower report states that the certifier or auditor would need to be an efficient bloodhound rather than a watchdog when monitoring. The amendment, at least in its intention, will encourage the use of bloodhounds rather than watchdogs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of the stock exchange has not been bad in terms of self regulation, although the one recent major blot on that record was die Halliday Simpson case. The details of that case took some time to uncover. In similar situations considerable bloodhound work would be needed to uncover practitioners—brokers or fund managers—acting either in collusion or separately, who deliberately flouted their position of trust. We must ensure that those people within the SROs who undertake that task are not impeded by the fear of repercussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I wish also to correct the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) who said that it was ironic that the hon. Member for Dagenham should cite the Lloyd's Act as an example to follow. I think that the hon. Member for Dagenham cited that Act in order to point out its deficiencies. That is one reason why I, and I believe, other Opposition Members, wish the Lloyd's Act to be strengthened by the provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) for pointing out die misapprehension of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). I was pointing to the provision in the Lloyd's Act as an example of an immunity clause which was drawn too widely and which could be used for improper purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and I ask die Minister to consider it seriously. It is one of the key elements in die Bill which will tend to strengthen the powers of the SROs. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has left,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
because amendments Nos. 154 and 131 may have some connection. If we could be assured on die question of competence, perhaps we should also be prepared to consider more favourably the exemptions proposed under amendment No. 131. If die immunity can be applied to the SIB why can it not be applied to the SROs? The hon. Member for Dagenham has correctly said that the SIB wishes the SROs to have that immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to listen to the Minister about whether the hon. Member for Dagenham has drafted the amendment in a way that will provide immunity from suit for those inside and not outside the organisations. However, the sense of the amendment, rather than its precise wording is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main reasons for supporting the amendment. First, it will strengthen the SROs and thus allow them to do their job effectively. The Minister must recognise that they will work in as difficult circumstances, at least in the early days, until the appropriate procedures and precedents are established. Secondly, the Minister is on record as saying that he wants people of the highest calibre to go into the SIB and the SROs. The amendment would encourage that. If the immunity were provided, the right people would be brought in, because they would feel protected by the clause and could thus act with more confidence and audacity. I ask the Minister to consider that seriously. We should like that immunity to be incorporated in die Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In principle, regulators should be liable for damages. The onus is on those who favour immunity to make the case for it. This is because granting immunity deprives people of the right to seek damages in the event of the regulator failing in his duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the designated agency we have exceptionally decided that on balance immunity is appropriate. I gather that hon. Members generally approve of that. The possibility that the agency might be unable to pay a large and unexpected award for damages could undermine the central institution in the regulatory structure. However slight that possibility may be, we wish to avoid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for immunity is less strong in the case of a recognised self-regulating organisation. While the collapse of an SRO in the face of a large award for damages would be disruptive, it would be possible for its members to maintain their authorised status by joining another SRO or by applying for authorisation by the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The immunity suggested in the amendment would apply only to action for damages by SRO members and not to damages for investors, However, even with this desirable limitation, I am reluctant to support immunity for SROs. Although die SROs will be acting within a statutory framework, they will not be exercising statutory powers in the way that the agency would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My opposition is to conferring immunity by statute, or to requiring it by statute as a criterion for recognition. It is open to members of an SRO to agree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
voluntarily to limit their rights to sue the body for damages, but I think that this is a matter which is best left to them. I do not believe it is necessary on investor protection grounds to provide for such immunity in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immunity for recognised SROs would raise the question of immunity for recognised professional bodies, recognised investment exchanges and recognised clearing houses. I believe that by confining statutory immunity to the agency we have drawn the boundary in the right place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be the first big hole in the Bill that we have found. It seems that the SROs will be completely boxed in. I predict that there will quickly be a series of legal actions. Members who refuse to accept the voluntary arrangement not to bring legal actions will want to tie up the SRO and so will bring a series of legal actions. The effect will be to make the SRO fearful of exercising the responsibilities that we intend to set for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to Conservative Members to consider the implications of this matter. The Minister suggested that he would have some doubt about the position within the SROs if we were to proceed on the proposed basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must assure the Committee that SROs will not be restricted in the carrying out of their functions. Members of the organisation will soon realise that if they are having any difficulty with their SRO, they need only to drive it into the courts. The moment that they do that, the effect will be exactly the same as a gagging writ. It will shut up the SRO. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first read the amendment, I had a great deal of sympathy for the sentiments behind it, but, having heard my hon. and learned Friend's reply, in particular the telling point that it would be open to an SRO, or its members in setting it up, to allow it to be exempt from being sued for damages—my hon. and learned Friend drew a valid comparison with professional organisations—I do not share the fears of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me inherently unlikely that an organisation that decides to belong to an SRO, particularly in the present climate of the City of London, would voluntarily give up its right to bring a suit against that SRO. That seems to be as unlikely as turkeys voting for Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there another organisation similar to an SRO whose members have given up the right to sue their organisation on a voluntary basis, and not because they are statutorily required to do so? If that is such an important point, can the hon. Gentleman give an example of such an organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can. But I can list professional organisations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Law Society—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Law Society is one; the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and my own professional body, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, are others. They all have that right, but do not exercise it. I do not see why, in practice, an SRO will be inherently different from these organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dismayed by the Minister's remarks. I can only hope that they were as unconvincing to some of his hon. Friends as they were to Opposition Members. I was encouraged by the general thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister stated a general principle, which is always a good way of getting oneself off a hook. It is difficult to disagree with a general principle, such as that it is undesirable to deny people their right to sue. We accept that, but should that principle be allowed to prevail over an overriding consideration—the need for effective regulation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) eloquently explained, it is clear that unless the SROs—I believe that the SROs themselves would argue this case— have this form of immunity they will be completely inhibited. To issue a writ for libel is a well-known practice simply to stop, or to make it impossible to pursue, a course of action. Given that, at the extreme, we are dealing with hardened people who will try every legal recourse open to them, I am sure that that is what they will do. I have no doubt that the SROs will find that extraordinarily difficult to overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not so much the actuality of having large sums of damages awarded against the SRO as the constant opportunity to impose that threat, even on weak grounds. The mere threat of issuing a writ involving the SRO in litigation will be enough to deter many people running SROs from effectively regulating those for whom they are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished at the apparent equanimity with which the Minister appeared to contemplate the possibility of SROs being bankrupted by the award of large sums of damages when attempting to exercise their functions under this legislation. I cannot believe that that is what the Minister has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington said that perhaps this was one of the first acid tests we have come to; it is; an acid test of the Government's seriousness of purpose. It is not adequate to leave to voluntary arrangements what is required to be laid down by statute. The fact that SROs are themselves voluntary organisations means that we have little alternative to giving them statutory immunity. That is exactly the argument for doing it by statute. Otherwise, as voluntary bodies, they will have no adequate foundation for the immunity that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister adheres to his stated position, a question will arise about the seriousness of the Government's purpose in providing the regulatory framework. As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington pointed out, a gaping hole will be created in the structure set up by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The Minister and his hon. Friends must think again. We shall press the amendment to a Division and I hope that some Conservative Members will support us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has, as usual, put his case brilliantly. Tangentially, we have come to one of the nubs of the argument: should the bodies be voluntary organisations, in which case there would be difficulties in conferring the immunity, or should they be, as the Opposition would prefer, statutory organisations, in which case it would be possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) pointed out, there is a danger that such bodies will be tied up in the courts by litigious members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large number of barristers—like the Minister 10 years ago—are plying for hire, and are anxious to benefit from the fruits of the Bill. There will be enormous scope for litigation, and for holding up and deadlocking the operations of the SROs unless the immunity is conferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to reinforce his argument. It would be possible for three or four determined people intent on evading regulation to frustrate the operation of the SROs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and, as usual, puts the case more brilliantly than I can. It is a great advantage to have lawyers on the Committee, as they can put sharply and in proper legal terms the thoughts that the rest of us feel vaguely and in-chotely. One can only defer to their wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, if the Minister is against the extension of the immunity in the fields specified, surely there is a case for the extension of immunity in the case of libel. It will be very difficult for the SRO to comment in any way on the activities of those it is supposed to be regulating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has qualified privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has answered the point raised by his hon. Friends the Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) would not pull out the plug on my arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must not be too dismayed. He shouild take comfort from the fact that the few instances in which there is a possible defence of qualified privilege have deterred bodies such as SROs from issuing certain statements. The possibility of writs still remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again my hon. Friend is right, putting the matter far better than I can, so I hope that my other hon. Friend, the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
Hackney, South and Shoreditch, will shut up. There is constant inhibition on comment, even with qualified privilege. Comment must be free, and readily made. Even if we have not other immunity, the immunity against libel suits should be widened, otherwise the procedures will be unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend initially replied by referring to an SRO being bankrupted by an unsuccessful suit against it. However, I am worried not by such an extreme eventuality, but by the practical deterrent effect that the threat of a suit could represent to investigators. The rules are rather complicated and the investigators will be looking, for example, into breaches of the principle of best execution, or considering whether appropriation of bargains is being carried out correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such investigations cannot easily be conducted behind closed doors, in private. They will involve gathering information from many people who are not members of the SRO. They will be essentially public investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, but in the distant past I gained practical experience of such matters. It seems to me that those are the sort of investigations that might be deterred. The SRO would be impeded in the proper execution of its duties because it did not have such immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene again, but I have had time to reflect and to consult my hon. Friend die Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). I may have misunderstood the Minister, but I thought that he said that an SRO could be bankrupted and that its members could men go> to another SRO. Does the Minister agree that that was roughly what he said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I regard mat as an extremely unlikely event, but, in considering the amendment, it is right to discuss the extreme possibilities. I was distinguishing between the consequences of bankruptcy of the designated agency, which would undermine the whole regulatory structure of the Bill, and the consequences of an extremely unlikely and hypothetical bankruptcy of an SRO, which would be most undesirable, but which would not have such fundamentally fatal consequences for the regulatory structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister refers to extreme circumstances, he draws the attention of those who may manage SROs in the future and of others who wish to manage SROs to the possible problems for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A group of firms acting as members within the stock exchange—I have picked one of the more reputable ends of the City—might set out to destroy the responsible SRO in that area. By arranging their affairs in a certain way, those firms might invite actions by the SRO to restrict their activities. Then, conspiring one with another, the firms might set out to bring a series of legal actions to undermine the financial position of the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stock exchange is perhaps not the best example. Let us consider a smaller SRO dealing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
with broking in securities or collective investment products—for example, AFBD, NASDIM or IMRO. Collectively, people could set out to undermine an SRO. They may even have personal reasons. They may dislike the management structure of the SRO, or they may have had difficulty in their social lives with a group of people, and feel that they should not manage the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be citing examples, but I am sure that there are other reasons for people taking action against each other that I have not identified, but which are just as relevant. People likely to take such actions might infer from our debates the future solution to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot afford to write off such possibilities as matters that might develop only in extreme circumstances. If the opportunity exists to bankrupt an SRO and to drive it out of the City, there are those who at some time in the future may set out to be precisely that, conspiring one with another. By agreement they may wish to- drive people into other SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City or members of City organisations may want a different framework in the SRO structure. They may not agree with the Minister's informal advice to Sir Kenneth Berrill or with the structure that SIB wants to set up. In a year or so they may think, "It isn't working in the way that we want," and decide to drive a SRO into taking a particular course of action. Surely wrapping people up in a series of court actions would be precisely the way to do it, and they will do it if they have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to deal with the various points that have been raised. Although the subject of the amendment is important, many of the arguments of Opposition Members are coloured by misapprehension.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the SROs should be statutory or voluntary bodies is fundamental to the Bill. If the hon. Member for Great Grimsby thinks that that is splitting hairs, it is difficult to see how we can have any sensible discussion of concepts at the heart of the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no argument to use that as a defence against an important principle. The Minister is seizing on a minor part of the argument—perhaps a weak part since I expressed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the principle. I want to establish the extent to which Opposition Members' arguments have been coloured by misapprehensions. The most conspicuous example of that was the suggestion by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby that he and his hon. Friends wished to make SROs statutory bodies. If we are told that that is not the case, we can proceed to the merits of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) who stressed the importance of ensuring that SROs should not be restricted in how they carry out their functions. He was clearly concerned that they should be seen to be effective, a concern which I share. However, there are ways in which that concern, and the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), can be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 contains requirements about SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, they are required to have adequate arrangements for effective monitoring and enforcement. If they fail to carry out those functions, the powers to seek compliance orders or to' revoke recognition by the designated agency could be used. There are powers to ensure that SROs are effective bloodhounds, to use the word quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South. If they were prevented by any means—including the kind of hypothetical means identified by Opposition Members—from carrying out those functions effectively, the powers in schedule 2 in the hands of the designated agency could be used to ensure that those functions were adequately met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister rejects the concept of immunity, SROs would have to have sufficient funds to cope with any legal actions taken against them. It is curious that he is arguing that they should not have the immunity, and that no specific reference to having sufficient financial funds should be built into the legislation. He should accept one of those; he should not reject both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see the connection between those two matters, as the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has explained it; I do not see that they are connected at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the point raised earlier by the hon. Gentleman, who regarded as fanciful any prospect of a voluntary agreement by members of self-regulating organisations, to confer on themselves immunity from suit. His contribution in that respect was also based on a misapprehension. It would not simply be a matter of one member of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
self-regulating organisation denying himself the right to bring action against his fellow members; equally, he would share in the liability of a suit brought by a member against the self-regulating organisation. As a member, he would have to contribute to any damages awarded. Therefore, there would be a clear incentive for members of a self-regulating organisation to enter a voluntary agreement of that kind. I do not regard the prospect of such agreements as being in the slightest degree fanciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not insignificant that the example of the kind of liability giving rise to the greatest anxiety, cited repeatedly by Opposition Members, was liability in respect of actions for damages for libel. That was especially stressed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who showed how actions for libel in other spheres could cause people to desist from repeating various observations, which they might otherwise continue to put into common currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to that point was given by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore). Qualified privilege would apply to any action for defamation against a self-regulating organisation. That is a significant safeguard. If we look at that way of testing the criterion—which was, indeed, selected by Opposition Members—to see how their anxiety would be alleviated by the ordinary operation of the law, we see that their anxiety is misplaced, although I accept that it is genuine, and that this is a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with all the points raised by Opposition Members. This is a serious point, but discussion of it has been coloured repeatedly by misapprehension. When the position is correctly understood, hon. Members will agree that there is no need for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the Minister's remarks have been marked by a rather unattractive attempt—especially with regard to his references to comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)—to slide off the point of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was also guilty, perhaps more understandably, of trying to hang our argument on a point which he regarded as perhaps the weakest point—the threat of actions of libel. His point about qualified privilege is not especially persuasive, as it does not deter people from issuing writs in those circumstances. They do not necessarily issue writs in the expectation that they will win an action for damages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may not deter people from issuing writs, but does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the implications of a writ, for the person upon whom it is served, differ enormously according to whether qualified privilege applies? If it does apply, it may not be a deterrent to that person continuing in any activity in which he was previously engaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says is right, but qualified privilege, with the available defences, is a matter decided by the courts. It is not like absolute privilege, where one has the certainty of winning or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
defending an action. The existence of qualified privilege does not prevent the use of writs for libel as gagging devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, actions for libel by no means exhaust the possible actions that might be brought against an SRO in those circumstances. There are actions for breach of trust, for breach of confidence and for various sorts of negligence—there can hardly be a wider cause of action than negligence—and all those possibilities would remain, notwithstanding the point that the Under-Secretary seeks to make in respect of libel and qualified privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are astonished and appalled mat the Minister can even contemplate such actions, whether for libel or for breach of trust or of confidence, being pursued to the point where the SRO is bankrupted, given the enormous problems in setting up an adequate range of SROs with adequate experience and resources and the very real question marks over the structure that the Bill is designed to put in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a question to the hon. Gentleman? It is common ground between us that self-regulating organisations should not have immunity from suit on the part of investors. Does the hon. Gentelman agree that if one is honest and faces up to the hypothetical extreme circumstance, the possibility of bankruptcy of a self-regulating organisation exists in the circumstance of a suit by an investor who has suffered loss?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a self-evident point, which I do not dispute. But what is in dispute is whether an important range of possible actions to be brought against the SROs by the very people whom they are meant to regulate ought to be permitted to be brought, or whether the SRO should be protected against such action. In my view, that is by far the most serious threat that could be posed to the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contemplating the possibility of an action being brought successfully and thereby bankrupting the SROs, the Minister does more than I could ever do to illustrate the gravity and magnitude of the threat. How can the Minister expect any SRO, from the stock exchange to an SRO yet to be formed, to operate effectively under the threat of the very type of action with the grave consequences to which he has drawn our attention? That is the nub of our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made our case for us and unless he can respond in a more forthcoming way to an extremely grave weakness at the heart of the structure of the Bill, we must press the amendment to a Division. Whatever the outcome of that Division, I hope that the Minister will think gravely and carefully about what he has said this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who are watching our proceedings will learn, that today in Standing Committee E we uncovered a great weakness in the Bill. We have heard a Minister refer to the bankrupting of SROs; that completely undermines the legislation. I hope that the Minister will qualify what he has said, and not only by referring to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
extreme circumstances. Perhaps he will also cover other points that I have raised during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put to the hon. Gentleman the same question mat I put to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). Is the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) suggesting that there should be immunity from suit at the behest of an investor? Does not the hypothetical possibility of bankruptcy exist in mat situation, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are not suggesting that. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made that clear in his reply to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise two other matters. The Minister said that the powers under paragraph 3 of schedule 2 would, to some extent, meet our case. He said that the designated authority could intervene. My answer is that that only reinforces our case, which is that an SRO will be fearful of the members, unless it has some immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SRO will now become fearful of the SIB, if the Minister intends to use paragraph 3 of schedule 2 as a way of constraining the excesses of the SROs or dealing with problems arising with them. An SRO could be as fearful of the SIB as it was of the membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to the voluntary arrangements that members can enter into with the SROs, the Minister asks the SROs to waive their rights voluntarily. If that is the case, some members may decide to join other SROs. Competition will arise between SROs on the kind of voluntary agreement that they want to extract from their members on immunity from prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head, but if one SRO were to say to its members, "We want you to give us immunity by way of voluntary agreement, in one particular area", the members could turn round to the SRO and say, "Why should we? We can go to the SRO down the road, and it is not asking for immunity. We shall simply switch our membership."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well advised by people in the City who understand these matters, and they tell me that competition could arise from the voluntary arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced that my hon. Friend is on to a strong argument. When the Minister shakes his head he must be taken to be saying that part of die requirement laid down by the Secretary of State or by the designated agency is that in every case an SRO should have the type of voluntary agreement in its constitution that the hon. and learned Gentleman suggested. Is he saying that that will be a mandatory requirement on SROs? If it is not to be, my hon. Friend's argument has substantial weight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People will want to maximise the areas in which they can bring suits for damages. Certain SROs will be more desirable because they require a lower level of immunity. Can the Minister prove me wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to touch on two points raised by the Minister, and then come back to the argument of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's arguments are most unsatisfactory, and unconvincing. He spoke of a hypothetical, extreme situation in which shareholders could bring suits against SROs to such an extent that they would be bankrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why would members wish to bankrupt SROs? We want immunity for members of the SROs. Why should members wish, deliberately, to enter a conspiracy to bankrupt their SRO or even to hog tie it? The answer is that they might easily wish to do so, because they are the people whom the SRO will be regulating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shareholders are not being regulated, but protected. There is no possibility of a group of shareholders, or even one investor, capriciously, or conspiring wilfully, bringing an unnecessary legal action against the SRO, because they are the people being protected. The members of the organisation, on the other hand, have every reason to bring trivial legal actions against the SROs because they are being regulated. That is why we want to bring in the immunity to deal with those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the dire consequences that he envisages do not already occur with organisations that have such rules? The stock exchange is a good example. Why does the hon. Gentleman believe that such events will occur when they have not done so at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but we are moving into an area which the Government and the Minister agree, has moved beyond the bounds of reasonable activity and which needs strenuous and stern action. Indeed, the Government have presented the Bill as taking stern action to correct something that has got manifestly out of control, which is bad and which, in certain areas, has become corrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society, the other bodies that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and, indeed, the stock exchange, have been established for a considerable time. Although uncertainty remains about die capacity of the stock exchange to correct some parts of itself, we must distinguish such bodies from the organisations being established on an entirely new basis to get control of a situation which is already out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may ask the Minister to bring in such immunities during the early stages of the operation. Under clause 2 the Secretary of State can, without reference to Parliament, dismantle the Bill as he wishes, and he may wish to remove the immunities in due course.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
But in the early stages at least, until the legislation gets a grip on the problem, such immunity would greatly strengthen the hand of the SROs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was asked by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) why such problems did not occur now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there is no competition among regulatory organisations. The stock exchange is unique in the City. Only when the new structure is established will regulatory bodies be under such pressures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) makes a relevant point. Even the existing situation, complicated and new as it is, will change after the big bang. All sorts of people will come into the arena who are not practitioners at present and who may not be subject to the civilised and decent behaviour to which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a further reason why there are no such actions at present. The conduct of business rules—or at least the suggestions in the SIB document—introduce a set of rules, the like of which do not apply to those bodies at present. There are many more reasons why people may defend themselves in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support and I hope that the Minister takes account of it. A considerable body of evidence and reasoning is accumulating as to why the Minister should think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister drew a parallel between shareholders who are being protected and members who are being regulated, but they have two different motivations. It is the first category that we wish to keep under tighter control. Secondly, the Minister was also unconvincing when he said that there was an incentive for members of an SRO to provide such voluntary immunity as part of their agreement for that SRO: because they would somehow save money by not having to share the costs of the legal actions required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question not of sharing the costs of the legal action required, but of sharing the liability for paying any award of damages made against the members of the SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough; that is an extension of my point, but I take the Minister's correction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I still suggest that such shared liabilities and costs will be minimal in comparison with the financial advantages of having freedom of action under a weak SRO which can be hog tied at any time by a conspiracy or by one person taking legal action. If any member of an organisation considered what balance of advantage he preferred, the incentive on the City would be for weak SROs. Liabilities and costs would be vastly outweighed by the financial advantages of freedom of operation under an SRO that they knew they could hog tie at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
The hon. Member for Workington made a pertinent point, perhaps from a different angle. I have expressed to the Minister my anxiety—and that of senior members of the stock exchange—that because we are now operating under civil law, there will be an incentive for SROs to have the minimalist structure of their regulations. The fewer regulations there are, the less chance there is of their being challenged in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Minister provides immunity, he will exacerbate that incentive by creating a position where SROs will want to have the fewest regulations possible to minimise their chances of being legally challenged by their members. If we provide them with immunity, we shall move automatically towards a position where that incentive towards minimalism disappears, and there will be an incentive in the opposite direction towards an appropriate and reasonable set of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for having identified that important point I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter. I agree with Labour Members, and, from the tone of their interventions, it appears that a number of Conservative Members regard this as a key point in the Bill, which will show the Government's seriousness about setting up an organisation that is strong enough to perform the task required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only two new points have been raised, and I do not wish to cover points already raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) cannot have it both ways. He cannot, at one and the same time, make a song and dance about bankruptcy, and claim that the liability, in which a member of the self-regulating organisation would share, would be minimal. Clearly, if realistic contemplation were made of the possibility of bankruptcy of the self-regulating organisation, that would have a dire effect on its members, who would be asked to contribute to that liability. That is why they would have a clear incentive to enter into a voluntary agreement to give them immunity from suit. The hen. Gentleman is under a misapprehension on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us yet another reason. He claims that members will press their SRO not to police too effectively in some areas, for fear that they would incur liability if they were bankrupted in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the record be read. That is what the Minister said. Perhaps he will qualify his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that at all. I repeat what I said originally about bankruptcy. I do not, realistically, expect bankruptcy to arise, but, when I rose originally to explore the implications of the amendment, I faced up to the extreme possibility, to bankruptcy of a designated agency, and that of a self-regulating organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the effects of shared liability would be minimal; I said that they could be significantly less than the financial advantages which had accrued to those members, from having a self-regulating organisation that did not regulate effectively, and from having a freedom of operation from an SRO which was, frankly, busted and liable to be hog tied at any moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my recollection of the hon. Gentleman's comments, but, nevertheless, let me deal with his last point, which was also raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to finish this point, as we have already spent considerable time on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members assume that there will be competition between self-regulating organisations on the basis of the least effective regulation that can be provided. That lies at the heart of their anxiety, and it is a serious matter. But it will be the designated agency's task to ensure that there is equivalence in terms of protection provided and enforcement procedures adopted, in respect of regulation that will be carried out by different self-regulating organisations. It is not true that competing self-regulating organisations will emerge when they see an opportunity to offer a soft touch to members who may be disillusioned by an existing organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The designated agency would have the power to refuse to recognise such a self-regulating organisation if an existing one already catered for people carrying out that kind of investment business. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's concern is misplaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be clear about what the Minister is saying. Is he saying that the equivalence of treatment would in each case require SROs to include in their rules and arrangements a voluntary agreement of the type that he has described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not saying that and I do not need to say that, or anything like that, to meet the point made by the hon Member for Workington. The hon Gentleman suggested that one of the consequences of an absence of the kind of immunity that he favours would be a flight from an effective self-regulating organisation to a less effective one so that people could escape the rigours of regulation. I have sought to show that the basis for his concern is misplaced, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply wanted to say that many of the SROs would probably be companies limited by guarantee and I see nothing in the Bill that would prevent that. There are many such organisations throughout the country. Their liability would be confined, in many cases, to about £5 and in those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
circumstances, I would have thought that that would be the liability of the members. Therefore, about 75 per cent, of what Opposition Members have said—and maybe a lot more—is entirely irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister one question, and I need a reply before we divide. Will he give an absolute assurance that where voluntary negotiated agreements are entered into' on the question of immunities, there will be no movement from one SRO to another arising from those different voluntary agreements on immunity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has not answered me, perhaps I did not phrase my question clearly. I want an assurance that there will be no shift from one SRO to another because one SRO demands a higher level of immunity in an agreement that is entered into' voluntarily. Without that, I do not see how we can proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman's question. I cannot and do not give him the absolute assurance that he requested, but the extent to which self-regulating organisations will be competing in the same limited area of investment business will greatly restrict the scope for the kind of activity to which he has drawn attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I put it to the Minster that he is saying that the nature of those negotiated agreements may determine the SRO to which members apply? He may think that that will not happen on a large scale—that is a question of his view as against mine—but he accepts that it will certainly be a consideration. Will the Minister say yes or no to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 93 is not perfect, but is one of a series of amendments that includes an interesting one from the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ash-down).

The series also includes the sensible amendment No. 155 of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of all the amendments is to infuse a greater independence, an involvement in the public interest, into the self-regulating organisations. We wish to prevent them from being closed cliques, dominated by the practitioners in the field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the amendment is imperfect, I hope that the Minister will approach it in a greater spirit of compromise than he has shown so far. I hope that he will not seize on a few chance obiter dicta of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
Mine as the mainstay of whatever feeble argument he may make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be so kind as to tell us which of his remarks are to be treated as obiter dicta and which he really means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall read the pages of my script that are marked private and confidential at greatest volume—those that I read sotto voce, because I am uncertain of my ground, are to be regarded as obiter dicta.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not yet struck the right keynote for dealing with the Bill. He changes his stance—sometimes he is accommodating, at other times aggressive, seizing on obiter dicta as weapons in his onslaught. I have a vision of the Bill trudging slowly ahead of us across the countryside pursued by the Minister, who is, in turn, pursued by me, as the parliamentary cop part of the Committee, shouting insults at him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to inculcate a more statesmanlike approach in the Minister. He is dealing with real discontent on his own side. It must be taken into account, as it represents a widespread worry about the independence of the self-regulating organisations. I doubt whether Divisions will yield to that worry among Government Members. The hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) spoke in favour of our amendments and then left the room for the Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After my flattering comments about the hon. Gentleman in an earlier sitting that is a disappointing response. It is not the sort of approach that is likely to build up the cross-party alliances that I believe some Opposition Members were hoping for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand 10 per cent, of the hon. Gentleman's point. However, on the crucial amendment about journalists and their interests he praised with faint damns and then left the room when the vote was counted. The only Conservative Member with courage—and that is very attenuated at times—is the hon. Member for Stafford who has stuck by his guns to a greater degree than anyone on that Back Bench range of rebels behind the Minister. I am trying to encourage the Minister to keep looking over his shoulder, and not necessarily just for knives in his back. He should also consider my remarks, which are not just stooges to be attacked as an easy way out. He is dealing with matters of concern to his own Back Benchers which must be accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraging the Minister to feel a new mood of statesmanship in participating in our concerns. He should show where our wording is deficient if it is, and accept the substance of a point rather than knock it down in a lawyer-like fashion. He should consider the principle of the need for greater independence in SROs. They should not become a closed clique representing vested interests, or a system for putting crooks in charge of the cop shop. Perhaps we should call them "crims"—as Mr. Murdoch might call them—seeing that a journalist from one of his papers is here reporting the Committee.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
The Minister should infuse an element of independence and a concern for the public interest, which bodies as important as these have to take account of. He should accept amendment No. 93 which includes the users and deals with the public interest. I want to dilute the preoccupation with Insiders which is the essence of the SROs, and to make sure that they are independent and seen to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Government intend most SROs to be practitioners—poachers turned gamekeepers, people who know the field and are knowledgeable about the industry and what is going on. They probably consider that a practical necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to dilute the self-interest of the organisations. Let us remember the scandals at Lloyd's which we shall bring into the scope of the Bill. Problems can arise when insiders do what other insiders have been doing. In other words, it can be an insider ramp, and the danger is that insider ramps may come to dominate SROs. We want an independent user representation with a specified minimum number of people so that the public can have confidence that outside interests are represented and involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of schedule 2 is not tight enough without amendments Nos. 93 or 157. Although the Minister will doubtless justify the phrase "proper balance" at inordinate length in his lawyer-like way as the only tenable and popular approach, it is a weak phrase. We seek to introduce a separate category, with the public interest represented on the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public interest requires people who, apart from their membership, are otherwise unconnected with the activities of that organisation. An independent point of view is needed, with more concern for the wider interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 93 also provides for a separate category of user—the consumers—to be represented. That vital interest is neglected by the schedule as it stands. If we are to have confidence in such a body, the consumers must be represented. The interests of the users and those of the wider public are often distinct from each other. My amendment seeks to ensure that those two separate interests are represented on the SRO. The amendment of the hon. Member for Yeovil has a similar effect. The concern is widespread and must be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing for an element of equality. I saw "Weekend World" on Sunday and I know now that I am an egalitarian. Apparently, we are all egalitarians, particularly the Prime Minister, who will talk down to anyone. I have read the book written by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) which is called " Socialism and Freedom" and is published in paperback by Macmillan at £6. I must, incidentally, congratulate my hon. Friend on his brilliant part in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equality is widening the opportunity for people to control their destiny. What opportunity will outsiders have to influence those tight little knots of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
self-interested people? Perhaps the amendment is inadequate, but it provides for the wider public interest. It will enable the public to feel that they can influence the decisions taken by the SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not regard this as an obiter dicta. It is my antipodean view, which is doubtless shared by my hon Friend the Member for Dagenham, that the SROs represent all that is worst in British life. They are government by coterie. They put the criminals in charge of the cop shop. They represent a system of government that is self-congratulating, self-reinforcing, self-selecting, self-protecting, self-respecting, self-producing and self-interested. And yet we are setting them up to protect the City's vital commercial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The members will pick each others' fleas, scratch each others' backs and regulate each other. That is characteristic of all too many aspects of British life and, indeed, represents the mentality of the Conservative party. They also promote each others' kids.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members appreciate the hon Gentleman's difficulty and embarrassment. He has read in the financial press that Labour Members are failing to attack the Government with the force and fervour that we customarily expect and enjoy. He must not suppose that in our previous proceedings he was reasonable to a fault. We know that he is concerned for investor protection. Will he limit his indulgence in party political point-scoring and return to the serious consideration and improvement of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refuse to be sanctified by the hon Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). Despite his sanctimonious approach, he is anxious to protect his own back. Earlier in our debate, he manifested a slight degree of discontent and independence. He is now concerned to protect himself from the glares of his Whip who is sitting on the Front Bench keeping a beady eye on the Benches behind him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the question of the 	<i>Financial Times</i> article has been raised, may I tell my hon Friend that the journalist was perceptive enough to recognise the cunning of Labour Members on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now discussing a serious amendment. I hope that we can continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to discuss that serious amendment in a serious fashion, Sir Michael. The 	<i>Financial Times</i> article was largely irrelevant. Had there been a degree of user involvement and a concern for the public interest in that article, as my amendment proposes to insert in the Bill, it would never have been written in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one who is not conversant with the City of London or financial institutions, I regard this seminar, under your tutelage, Sir Michael, and the class monitorship of my hon. Friend, as a gigantic adult education class carried on at public expense. I am

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
a recalcitrant piece of educational material, learning my lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to try to grasp the problem. It is more difficult for Labour Members, as we do not have the financial or City background of Tory MPs, one in seven of whom are members of Lloyd's and they have a better background than we have. However, we are catching up, and the amendment is vital to that process, as it contains an essential basic principle that the SROs should be widened and should represent the anxieties of those the Opposition speak for and of the users, and not simply the self-interests of those dominating one section of City activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be diverted by the hon. Member for Straford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) into a party political harangue, and shall return to my main theme: self regulation, without the provision in the amendment for the intrusion of concern for the interests of the public and of the users of the service is not good enough. It does not inspire the necessary confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the scandals, and not only those in Lloyd's, that have discredited the name of the City, and they have been perpetrated by insiders. The regulatory organisation must not therefore be dominated by insiders, many of whom have known that these things are going on, but have said nothing, and have dealt with the scandals inadequately when they have emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a guarantee of independence if there is to be public confidence that future scandals will be put down promptly. All the problems have been those of insiders. Amendment No. 153 of the hon. Members for Stafford, sought to provide that the practitioner should be "honest, competent and solvent ". But as well as those characteristics, which I hope that we take for granted—except under this Government—we need independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In too much of what he says on the Bill, the Minister tries to get it both ways. I can anticipate, the Minister's reply. With some deterioration in style and grammar, he will be reading from his red book before long. He will try to get it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real supervision and the real guarantee of independence and concern for the public interest will come from the SIB, hovering in its ethereal and non-statutory way, impressing its concerns on the SROs beneath it. Yet when we try to strengthen the SIB and provide it with real power over the SROs, the Minister does not want it. He is invoking the SIB as an organ of protection in one respect, but not giving it the tools to do the job. The SIB will not, and cannot, possibly have the time, the staff, or the ability to supervise all the complex fields covered by the SROs; we must have confidence in the SROs themselves. That is what my amendment seeks. It seeks the necessary independence which will give the wider public the confidence that the views of organisations acting on their behalf and the views of the users are being considered. The similarity of amendment No. 155 tabled by the hon. Member for Stafford shows that that worry is shared by both sides of the Committee. Even if the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
Minister seeks to dismiss us with obiter dicta in his usual fashion and by hiding mehind the protective mechanism of his brief, he should at least listen to discontent expressed by his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the intrusion of an irritant that makes oysters from pearls; we are trying to intrude the irritant of the users' interests to ensure that independent SROs can produce pearls. Let us introduce the irritant before the oyster closes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I have just heard from the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) puts me in mind of what the Duke of Wellington said during the peninsular war when reviewing his allies, the Spanish troops; " I don't know what they do to the enemy, but, by God, they put the fear of God in me."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is an important question of principle. I entirely repudiate the attacks that the hon. Gentleman has made on people in the City and on the Conservative party. He overindulged himself in expletives and exaggerations. I hope that when he has heard what I have to say he will understand that my argument has a serious import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the substance of the hon. Gentleman's argument and sympathise with it, but the Bill is about setting up services that people can recognise. It provides an attractive market place, particularly for those abroad to use the extremely good services that the City can provide. The Bill is about market development, regulation and the prevention of fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be made clear and put on the record that the reason why the Government have brought the Bill forward is that, unlike previous Labour Governments, they have grasped the nettle and dealt with the problem. The Government acknowledge the fact that it is important to get the situation in the City right to ensure that we avoid fraud and provide a useful market place to which people from other countries are prepared to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Great Grimsby that the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was the Chairman of the Committee that considered the Lloyd's Bill and is now the shadow Secretary of State for Social Services, so any misgivings that the Opposition have about the matter may be reasonably nailed at their own door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want SROs to be a cosy club, nor do I want them to be generated by self-interest and by rules that are devised exclusively for their own benefit. I highlight the problem by pointing out that the schedule to the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 sets out the constitution—it is highly relevant that the Act is not repealed by this Bill—
	<br><q><p>"The Council shall consist of—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>	<i>(a)</i> twelve persons … 	<i>(b)</i> five persons nominated by the Secretary of State of whom one shall be a—</p></q>
lawyer, another a member of a
	<br><q><p>"body of accountants and a third shall be a person appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of persons who are or may become policyholders of insurance companies."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
So the point has already been made. Lloyd's has external names; I could give other examples, such as the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960, which I have mentioned in another connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that in all reasonably equivalent SROs, in this sphere and in others, with the exception of chartered bodies—even the Law Society has an independent element in its disciplinary tribunal—independence is directly relevant to the manner in which it is seen by Parliament. It is important to get the balance right and to have in each SRO independence on the one hand and a majority of practitioners on the other. The problem cannot be avoided and I do not think that the Minister will seek the avoid the point in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My guess is that the Minister will say that I should read paragraph 5, which states that there must be a "proper balance"
	<br><q><p>"	<i>(a)</i> between the interests of the different members of the organisation; and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>	<i>(b)</i> between the interests of the organisation or its members and the interests of the public."</p></q>
I fear that, if we are not careful, we may have a spate of actions for declarations about what is or is not a proper balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we have a practical Bill. The SIB says on page 17, paragraph 2.11 of the "Regulation of Investment Business ":
	<br><q><p>"In this connection the Board will review the entire decision-making structure of an SRO, and will expect the SRO to have in appropriate positions on its Board or Council a suitable number of independent individuals of high standing."</p></q>
The people who sit on the SROs and on its council will determine all matters relating to its government in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12, on which the SIB has already expressed its views, is directly relevant to my point. SROs could become a rather cosy club. That would make the present situation even worse. People could say that Parliament had legislated for the SROs but that they did not have the expected independent memberships. My amendment is much tighter than that of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, and I hope that the Minister will give it a fair wind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of the schedule is deliberately vague. I am aware that in legislative drafting there are times when vagueness is thought expedient so that people can make their own arrangements around the wording of the Bill. However, I believe that in this case clarity is required and that we ought to have independent members of SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am making already applies to the designated agency—the SIB—as is illustrated in schedule 6 and clause 96. The schedule states:
	<br><q><p>"The members of the governing body must include—
	<ol>
	<li>persons with experience of investment business … and</li>
	<li>other persons, including regular users ".</li></ol></p></q>
My argument already applies to the designated agency. I can say only that I have no contact with the National Consumer Council or, I am glad to say,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, and I hope that the Minister will give my conclusion a fair wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Cash) and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby is absent, but no doubt he will be back. Both hon. Members made several points that I wished raise and which I need not cover again in detail. I shall not follow the rhetoric of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. He has covered the ground most adequately—some may say that he has covered it several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to determine whether the Government are serious about providing a proper framework, what will happen about establishing the governing bodies is a key criterion. We heard some splendidly strenuous rhetoric from the Government. They have made something of an issue of saying how hard and tough they are being on the City. In reality, the Government's proposals are in all respects as loose as it is possible to be, with the Minister taking legalistic shelter behind such words as "proper person". I venture that he will build wonderful castles in the air from the words "proper balance" identified by the hon. Members for Stafford and for Great Grimsby. I do not for a second doubt that we shall hear wonderful legalistic paragraphs from the Minister's brief, based on his experience, about how the provision is sufficient and how it covers the whole subject. I put aside the unworthy thought that the Minister has created in the Bill not only the maximum room for lassitude but the maximum possibility of lucrative briefs for his friends. That suggestion does not necessarily turn on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in line with the Government's proposals that SROs should have a certain degree of flexibility but, goodness knows, flexibiliy can be taken too far. The Bill says practically nothing about the structure of the governing body of the SROs and it says nothing about composition and nothing specific about the chairman or about how the proper balance will be achieved. This provision is typical of others in the Bill and is thoroughly laissez-faire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever the Minister has had an opportunity to be specific about any of the procedures in any of the schedules, he has deliberately fudged the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of being laissez-faire but of trying to strike the right balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. We may disagree about what is the right balance and what is laissez-faire. If the Minister and the Government are to honour their rhetoric about imposing on the City a framework of legislation that will reform its institutions, they must be far more specific. The Minister and the Government will be accused in due course of always giving the City operators the benefit of the doubt. Whenever the Minister has the chance to put his foot down and to be specific about his proposals for putting the Government's intentions into legislation he dodges and ducks the issue, and I bet that he will do it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
I seek to achieve what the hon. Member for Stafford seeks to achieve in a different way. The hon. Member for Stafford said that his amendment was tighter, but I ask him to re-examine it. Amendments Nos. 93 and 157—different though they are— are much more specific than amendment No. 155. If the hon. Member for Stafford is looking for a tighter amendment, he should consider setting aside his own and looking more carefully at the proposals in the other two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the outline reasons for such a procedure—the hon. Member for Great Grimsby did that at some length. However, I shall point out some of the significant factors in my amendment, as compared with his. Opposition Members and those who are interested in strengthening the legislation and providing a more specific framework for the governing body might like to bear in mind that amendment No. 157 allows the structure of the governing council to be enshrined within the rules of the organisation, not just within this legislation. That provides a greater safeguard. I hope that the hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) will take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor dear to our hearts is that the amendment requires the chairmen of the SROs to be appointed by, and liable to removal from office by, the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) is shaking his head in bewilderment. I should be happy to accept an intervention from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the amendment is that we believe that it is important in the initial stages for the Government to take considerable control in the establishment of the organisations. There is serious doubt—in City circles, too—about the initial period. My amendment would allow the Secretary of State to intervene in decisions on who will be the chairman of these vital organisations—it is right that he should have a say in that—and to delegate that power to the SIB, as he can with other regulations in the Bill. He may choose to delegate that power to the SIB from the start. The amendment gives him the option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is arguing against the principle of self-regulation and moving towards direct regulation, which is a concern of the stock exchange council. That may be what he wants, but it is not embodied in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that that should be the case. Provided that we provide a free-standing organisation, the fact that the Secretary of State will appoint someone from the list of the great and the good to be chairman of the SRO should not diminish the SROs capacity for self-regulation. The Bill permits the Secretary of State to delegate powers to the SIB once the organisation is established. However, it is vital to get the structure right when setting it up. If we do not get it right initially, it will probably never be right thereafter. It will have established a bad framework and practices which cannot be effectively reformed subsequently, and will have problems in catching up with itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
I included the power in the amendment because it is one that the Secretary of State can use in the crucial initial period when it is important for him to have clear lines of accountabilty and responsibility. SROs such as Lloyd's have always fallen down in the past because the lines of accountability and responsibility have been so weak and fuzzy that someone could always say that the buck does not rest at his desk but at someone else's. We should be able to have access to such accountability in the House of Commons, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 allows the Secretary of State to delegate power and to delegate and alter the legislation without coming before the House. Surely mat is equivalent to the kind of accountability built into the American congressional system, where people can scrutinise key appointments. That is a useful feature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I adumbrated that important point on Second Reading and I have carried it through in the amendment. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that that is its strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third element, which is important and has been covered at length by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, is the specific inclusion of a responsibility for the governing body to look after the public interest. That is already included, but in a weak and indeterminate fashion in paragraph 5 of the schedule. As usual, it is only hinted at and we should like to see it made specific. My amendment does not go as far as that of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. I merely say that the members of the organisation should constitute less than half of the total number in the SRO. That seems to be sensible and correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to achieve a framework, which will be specified by the Government and carry through the Government's rhetoric in terms of legislative practice. Without that, one is tempted to think that the Government are simply uttering empty rhetoric on the matter. We believe that it will be a structure in which we can have greater confidence and, in the long term, therefore, there will be less interference. The Minister may argue that we are interfering in a matter in which he does not wish to interfere, but, if he is prepared to create such a framework, that will result in the long term in less intereference, not more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is put into practice, we shall not simply be hoping for the interests of the public and users to be taken into account, but positively assuring that they will be. That is one of the reasons why this is a key amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me summarise the three reasons why I wish to see the amendment accepted. First, it makes the Secretary of State responsible for the appointment of chairmen of SROs, although he may wish to devolve that later. Secondly, it provides a specific, rather than an indeterminate, framework over which lawyers may argue on fat fees in the future, about how to put into effect the balance which the Minister has included in the measure. Thirdly, it gives specific force to the idea suggested by the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
Member for Stafford, that the public interest should be specifically protected and represented in a clear and identifiable form in the structure of the governing body. I hope that the amendment will be accepted for those reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who has now returned to listen to the debate, might be surprised to know that I welcome his amendment for giving us the opportunity to debate the important, but difficult matter of the composition of SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I address my remarks to amendment No. 157, tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ash-down), I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will not take that as a disparagement. I wish to deal with a number of detailed points in that amendment. First, let me turn to the provision that the chairman should be liable to removal from office. I have listened to the arguments advanced in support of the Secretary of State having the power to intervene in the nomination of the chairman of an SRO, especially in the initial stages, but I am anxious about that proposal. It might be right, but, if that is so, we are losing independence in an important respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with hon. Members who have tabled the amendments that we need representatives of the affected interests in SROs. It is a weakness of those amendments that they tend to water down an especially useful provision in paragraph 5(a), that there should be a proper balance, including a representation,
	<br><q><p>"between the interests of the different members of the organisation".</p></q>
The wording chosen by the hon. Member for Yeovil dilutes that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is desirable, even essential, to ensure that the interest of the users of financial services and—there is a distinction—the interest of the public are represented. However, there are considerable practical difficulties. The hon. Member for Yeovil claimed that the virtue of his amendment is that it is more specific than the others. How does he propose to get such representatives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all see that, in general terms, it is desirable to have distinguished members and luminaries of the City, who are versed in financial services and investment, serving on the SROs. But how, in practice, can we ensure that people of such quality serve on them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should address ourselves to the important question, on which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby may have reflected already, whether the members of SROs should be full time. One's first response is: yes, they have an important responsibility and should be full time. However, would not that make it harder to get people of the distinction and standing that we want to serve on the SROs? The SROs should not be manned by retired people or people seconded from other organisations —firms rarely second their best people to serve on other bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to an existing self-regulating organisation. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) referred, set up the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Its two chairmen have served with distinction and been well-regarded in the insurance broking world. The editor of "Money Mail" and someone from the Consumers' Association have also been attracted as representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend is able to cite an encouraging precedent. I am not pessimistic about it, but the hon. Member for Yeovil could help us amplifying his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about perhaps five or seven SROs and the designated agency, so we shall be looking for a lot of people of suitable standing and distinction all at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil concludes:
	<br><q><p>"provided that the persons referred to in sub-paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> of this paragraph shall constitute less than one-half of the total membership of the Council".</p></q>
The persons referred to in sub-paragraph 	<i>(b)</i> are those who are
	<br><q><p>"capable of representing the interests of the members of the organisation ".</p></q>
That provision, if implemented, would depart from self-regulation. One could hardly call it self-regultion if persons representing the interests of the members of the organisation were not in a majority on the SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are genuine practical difficulties. They lead me to doubt the wisdom of specifying in detail, as the hon. Member for Yeovil has done, the membership of SROs, although I accept his object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). The hon.

His pusillanimous approach to those matters did not much help the Committee. Thank God that he was not alive when the Beatitudes were written, because

I think that my hon. Friend was trying to say at our first sitting that, given the wretched Bill before us, we would try to make some sense out of it. That is the proper function of the Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not much more likely that by the time the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made his complimentary remark at our first sitting he had read the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any member of the Committee would find it hard to argue that an independent chairman and a set number of independent persons on the SROs, would be damaging. We should agree, as I think the public would agree, that it would help the basic integrity of the body, would lead towards fair dealing and that it would bring investor public, and parliamentary confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get away from smug remarks about setting a thief to catch a thief, and having poachers turned gamekeepers, and turn to the serious question of independent chairmen. One of the problems about these institutions is that if the chairman becomes dishonest there is a fair possibility that the whole organisation will become venal. If the chair-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
Man becomes a thief, the institution has real problems. The more prestigious the institution, the greater the difficulties; the nearer the institution is to the top of the British Establishment, the more complex the problems. That is one of the fundamental arguments for having independent chairmen for SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking in the abstract. We have already an organisation that could become an SRO under the Bill—Lloyd's. [HON. MEMBERS: " Ah ".] —It is no good hon. Members saying " Ah ". Lloyd's gives us valuable experience on which to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if a non-independent chairman of one of the SROs, publishes a document, as Sir Peter Green did, in which in effect he says, " I am thief; I stole the interest from my company Imperial, a Cayman Islands company "? If that could happen with other SROs, we would find the Establishment resorting to a series of curious devices in order to overcome the difficulties. We do not want that. It was very unpalatable when it happened with Lloyd's in the past; we do not want it to happen with Lloyd's in the present; and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
