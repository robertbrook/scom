	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made repeated requests for improvements in our accommodation, especially today, with regard to the heat. The heat has been turned off, which will probably mean that we freeze next week, although there will be little difference today. But we have done our best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That during further proceedings on the Financial Services Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Howard.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are not disposed to oppose the motion and we are as keen as the Minister to make progress. A fair and objective reading of the Committee 	<i>Hansard</i> will reveal that we have not attempted to hold up proceedings. One way of ensuring rapid progress would be for the Minister to recognises more promptly the merits of some of our amendments. If he accepted them more speedily, as he did with amendment to clause 12, we might make rapid progress, to everyone's pleasure and approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, assuming that we make reasonable progress during the morning sittings—as we have every chance of doing—I hope that it will not be necessary to sit very often in the afternoon, especially not on Thursday afternoons, if that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a tidying up amendment. Rule alterations made by the Secretary of State in the circumstances specified in subsection (1) are to be made directly, not by order. The amendment makes corresponding reference in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 11, line 20, leave out 	<br><q><p>"on his own account or in partnership".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 119, in page 11, line 21, after "partnership", insert
	<br><q><p>"or as a member of an incorporated practice under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980,".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the amendment is simple. It is to meet what is now a real possibility, namely, that accounting firms will be able to operate as limited companies, rather than as partnerships. It is a real possibility because it is contemplated by the eighth directive on company law, which has now been adopted. I understand that the Department of Trade and Industry will be consulting on the arrangements for implementing that directive fairly soon. Will my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary say when that is likely to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For more general reasons the Office of Fair Trading is now examining what it calls entity restrictions in professional firms and asking why, for example, accountants cannot practise with solicitors or actuaries. The Office of Fair Trading may also examine the form in which accounting firms practise. To accommodate any future change it would be useful to approve the amendment to make it clear that professional firms could practise as partnerships, sole traders or limited liability companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Could</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) as I too am aware of the possibilities to which he referred. The difficulties in obtaining insurance cover are a major reason for accountants in particular looking for some form of limited liability to restrict their liability if things go wrong. It is right to expect such a change in the law and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 119 is in the same direction but is rather more specific. If my understanding of the brief from the Law Society of Scotland is correct, the possibility to which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield mentioned in relation to accountants in general has become a reality with Scottish solicitors, and I tabled the amendment to take account of the fact that Scottish solicitors are now permitted to practise in incorporated bodies. It is purely a drafting amendment and I hope that the Minister will accept it or assure us that the point is dealt with in some other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should start by explaining the reason for the provisions in the clause as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Membership of a professional body is an individual matter, and the sanctions that the body possesses are generally exercisable only against individuals. The general approach underlying the Bill is to prevent anyone who is not adequately supervised from carrying on investment business. That poses difficulties in the case of partnerships and bodies corporate where not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
all the members or controllers are members of a professional body and the firm or company may not itself be regulated by such a body. It would, moreover, be difficult in practice to stop an unauthorised partner carrying on investment business in the name of a partnership where other partners who are members of a recognised professional body were authorised to do so. The clause limits authorisation to members who practise on their own account or in partnership. In the case of partnerships, it provides that the partners in a partnership are only authorised by virtue of membership of a recognised professional body if all of them are so authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a good deal of sympathy with the principle underlying the amendments. It seems likely that several professions will move increasingly toward incorporated practices and mixed partnerships in future years. As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, that is already true of solicitors in Scotland. So long as suitable safeguards can be devised, the Government do not wish the Bill to stand in the way of such developments. I have listened with care to the suggestions that have been made today and I should welcome further suggestions from members of the Committee, from the professional bodies and from others who may be affected. If a satisfactory solution to those problems can be devised I shall table amendments at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have said earlier that I am parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. My hon. and learned Friend's comments were very helpful and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once an hon. Member has declared an interest in Committee perhaps hon. Members will remember that interest throughout our sittings. I do not press the observation as an important point, but it may help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 11, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) Investment business is not incidental to a professional practice if it constitutes a substantial part, either absolutely or proportionately, of the time spent in that practice, or of the turnover or earnings of that practice, and the question of whether or not investment business does constitute such a substantial part shall be determined, in the case of a partnership, either by reference to individual partners or to the partnership as a whole.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 142, in clause 18, page 12, line 33, after "kind", insert "and scale".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment takes us to the heart of a difficult question—the way in which professionals are to be authorised. They are important sources of investment advice and carry on a substantial amount of investment business, yet will do so in such numbers that it is difficult to see how the Securities and Investments Board could cope if each were to seek direct authorisation in his own name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, then, are professionals to be authorised? The Bill provides an answer in clauses 15 to 20: by becoming members of recognised professional bodies. Although I generally support that solution, it adds to the complexity of methods of authorisation. I shall listen with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) when, on clause stand part, he seeks to have the clauses deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are both anxious about how the provisions will operate. I shall listen carefully to my hon. Friend's arguments, but I am not at present convinced that it is right to strike out clauses 15 to 20. I fear that if we do so, overwhelming complications will arise, and I am sure that SIB would be unwilling to be faced with thousands of applications for direct authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My preferred course would be to ensure that the structure provided by clauses 15 to 20 will not provide too wide a gateway. The Committee may agree that while membership of a professional body should be a means of authorisation, the means should be strictly regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 15 places great weight on the word "incidentally", but unless the term is defined narrowly, I fear that a great deal of investment business will be authorised under the provision. That will lead us to question the effectiveness of the regulatory procedures laid down by a recognised professional body, and we shall debate those later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 116 seeks only to limit the type of business which can be authorised under the provisions and to ensure that it is properly controlled; amendment No. 142, tabled by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is animated by the same objective, which is shared by SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professionals—not only solicitors and accountants, but chartered surveyors and so on—provide, in their professional practice, an important source of investment advice, and investment services such as insurance broking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 21 of schedule 1 which we have debated, exempts from authorisation investment business that is totally necessary to the carrying out of other more central parts of a professional person's duties. So a provision already exists to set aside the purely incidental, and amendment No. 116 seeks to ensure that any person who is seriously engaged in the provision of investment advice, should not be able to seek authorisation simply by virtue of his membership of the Law Society or one of the accountants' professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although amendment No. 116 may be far from ideal, and the Minister will no doubt tell me that it is unclear, it attempts to give greater meaning to the word "inci dentally" and to ensure that where investment business that is substantially—a term which has meaning for lawyers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They make a lot of money out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt that is true. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) says that lawyers have made a great deal of money out of the word "substantial" which is no doubt true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A substantial amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a substantial amount of money. The word is designed to give a greater meaning to the word "incidental", and to allay fears that have arisen as to the scope of the provisions. The fears are best illustrated by the reaction to the consultative document issued by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
MIBOC on the role of insurance intermediaries. Having read the Minister's speech on this subject, I accept that MIBOC is not advocating what it says in the consultative document but it adumbrates the possibility of an intermediate category of professional people who for some reason cannot be expected to meet the normal standards laid down in respect of those who are either independent intermediaries or tied agents, and who will therefore be allowed to meet lower standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see why that combination of the uncertain ambit of the provisions plus the possibility that the regulation would be less rigorous gives rise to concern. I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us that the Government's intention is to maintain a strict system of regulation. I know that the SIB is concerned about the possibilities of people getting through this potentially wide gateway. Our concern should be not only to restrict and regulate it effectively, but to ensure that the provisions in the Bill are adequately drafted to secure that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of my amendment No. 142 is to determine that we are talking about a quantitative as well as a qualitative restriction. Paragraph 4.12 of the White Paper deals with the exemption for professional firms and states:
	<br><q><p>"This exemption will apply only as long as the investment business of the firm concerned is not a significant part of its activities".</p></q>
The SIB document contains a reference to the scale of activities. There appear to be up to a dozen candidates for recognition as professional bodies. I wonder whether my honourable and learned Friend the Under-Secretary could say who they are. It would be helpful to know whom the board has in mind. I have identified four bodies of accountants and two bodies of solicitors—those of England and Wales and of Scotland—which makes six bodies. I am not sure whether actuaries fall into this category, or chartered surveyors—I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) will want to talk about them later. There is a restriction that says that a professional body has to be recognised by statute as having some statutory function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2.20 of the SIB document goes on:
	<br><q><p>"The board will be equally concerned to ensure that the professional body has the ability to enforce its rules, and in this context will wish to review very closely the kinds of investment business activity that its members may carry on under the body's regulation and the scale on which its members do such business."</p></q>
My amendment merely seeks to introduce the words "and scale" to make it clear that there could be that sort of restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed paragraph 21 of schedule 1,1 said that it might be helpful to members of the Committee if they had some idea of how much investment business was done by professional firms. When the question first came up, the Institute of Chartered Accountants did not have the information and commissioned a survey by a firm of market research consultants called Taylor Nelson whose report goes into detail about what size of firm generates that kind of income. Its first general conclusion was:
	<br><q><p>"for very few firms in investment business, however defined, a significant part of their activities. Although a high proportion of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
accountancy firms accepted commissions, which would on the face of it indicate substantial investment business, in practice income for the majority of firms was less than £3,000 in the last complete year."</p></q>
The survey reveals that investment business is a background activity, which is what we are talking about. Background activity is a simple way of describing the concept of incidental business. It says:
	<br><q><p>Most firms, although giving investment advice in one form or another, don't charge fees for it. Few practices (17 per cent in England and Wales) effect or hold themselves out as effecting transactions in investments, even as agents—those that do earned relatively low levels of income. Similarly, investment management of any type was undertaken by only 7 per cent of firms in England and Wales and 16 per cent in Scotland. Even as executors or trustees, only 13 per cent of respondent companies in England and Wales were involved in investment business."</p></q>
There is more detail to support that general conclusion. It shows that for most firms the situation is that which the Bill contemplates—that the business is insignificant. If a firm has significant investment business, it will not be able to take advantage of the clause. It will have to register directly with the SIB or join an SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the hon. Gentleman's declaration of interest, the points that he has just made, and his role as the representative of chartered accountants, I would have expected him to favour the structure proposed in the Bill: that necessary but incidental investment business should be excluded, that incidental investment business should be authorised by membership of the professional body, and that significant or substantial investment business should be authorised in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment limits the area that would be included under incidental business. Will he tell us whether the Institute of Chartered Accountants wants to be a recognised professional body that would authorise its members for incidental investment business? In the amendment, is he speaking for the Institute of Chartered Accountants or independently of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Institute of Chartered Accountants wishes to be a recognised professional body, but it is a long way from that. The SIB has had one exploratory, meeting with the institute, which I think is in the lead on that—I know of no professional bodies that are ahead of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a long way to go. At the meeting, the representatives of SIB asked many basic questions about the institute. They did not know much about it. I think that they were a bit shocked to discover that if they cannot agree with the institute to make it a recognised professional body, 17,000 firms will have to register directly with the SIB. It will want to take that into account during the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ideal arrangement would be for the institute to be recognised under the clause. The institute suggested the amendment to me. It seeks to define clearly what is "significant" and what the cut-off point is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will understand that his amendment implies that the Institute of Chartered Accountants—and perhaps other similar professional bodies—is unwilling to take on the responsibility for authorising those 17,000 firms—it would be too strong to say that it wishes to escape its responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By introducing a scale that restricts the number of firms that would be authorised under clauses 15 to 20,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
is the Institute of Chartered Accountants telling its members that have substantial investment business to seek authorisation by other means, as it does not want that responsibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Some firms are already members of NASDIM. Those firms tend to have separate subsidiary companies which conduct their investment business. Those subsidiary companies are the authorised investment businesses, as it were, and they are members of NASDIM or registered directly with the DTI under the Prevention of Fraud (Investment) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institute is saying that if a firm has significant investment business, it should seek direct authorisation or membership of an appropriate SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a dichotomy in the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). It expresses anxiety about the scale of operations rather than about whether they are incidental to the main activity of the professional body concerned. That would appear to go against the objective of protecting investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of professional bodies, such as accountants, chartered surveyors—my own profession—or solicitors, may pursue their main profession, with investment business as an incidental activity. That investment business may give more protection to the public if it were on a large scale than if it were on a small scale. A practice that rarely conducted investment business would have very little experience of that business, so it may give bad advice. A practice that conducted a high volume of investment business, incidental to its main activity, would be more likely to give an investor good advice because it would have more experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall hear from my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary about professional bodies, but the ones that are likely to be approved are those whose rules of conduct are generally considerably higher than those that exist at the moment—for example, for NASDIM—or, indeed, those that are likely to exist. That raises the question of competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their general rules of conduct may indeed be higher than those that we might expect and those that currently prevail for NASDIM, but we are concentrating on rules of conduct in respect of advice and investment, where they are likely to be much looser or, in many cases, non-existent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipated me. I was going to raise the question of competence to give advice and to conduct investment business in a way which would protect the public. My point is that a high volume of business may give greater protection to the public than would a low volume, and I would be interested in the hon. Member for Dagenham's response to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I see his point, but it is different from the one that is at issue under the amendment. Somebody carrying out substantial investment business may be more expert, so may provide better investor protection. But the point of the amendment and, I believe, of much of the anxiety about the provisions, is to determine the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
appropriate means by which a professional person or practice should be authorised to carry out investment business, small or large. The processes of authorisation and regulation will be important; that is the point of the Bill. Therefore, is it appropriate for somebody conducting substantial investment business to be authorised under a regime which, many people fear, may be less rigid and less onerous than that provided by recognised SROs? It is not a question whether a person is competent; it is a question of how rigorous the regulatory regime will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be possible for the requirements for registration for a recognised professional body which are set out in this chapter to take the hon. Member for Dagenham's point into account? There must be a test within the recognised professional bodies and I am sure that they will make their own rules to ensure that those who intend to practice are competent and behave in a way consistent with other SROs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak to the amendment, but it introduces an interesting point which strikes at the heart of clauses 15 to 20, and identifies the centre of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) for providing the details of how much business is carried on under the cloak of "incidentally". If, as he said, a large number of people are involved in such business we must decide how to define the word "incidental" and how the rules regarding incidental investment business can be enforced. I welcome amendment No. 116 tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), with all the lacunae mentioned by the hon. Member for Bournemouth West (Mr. Butterfill), because it attempts to define the word "incidentally" in a way that will be understood not only by the law courts, but by the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter. Many people outside the Committee will read the records of these proceedings to see the extent to which Parliament and the Committee believe that there should be a restraint on the way in which solicitors, accountants and others may provide investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first job on leaving university was in the investment division of a merchant bank. One of our important tasks was to increase the business under our control. A business committee was set up to find new portfolios—for private clients, pension funds or whatever. One fertile area investigated by the committee to capture new business was the professions. It was felt then, and I believe that it remains true, that locked up in the files and clients lists of solicitors, accountants and others were considerable sums of money under management. I suspect—though it can never be quantified—that the indirect and direct investment advice provided by professionals over the years has had an enormous influence. It may have been given by long-standing family solicitors over generations, or by managers of charitable funds or corporate funds. The shift towards obtaining advice from financial institutions has been relatively slow in Britain compared to that in the United States, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We have a responsibility to judge the extent to which we should inhibit by legislation practices that have worked well in the past, where people have been content with the "incidental" or "substantial" advice from their solicitor or accountant in the management of investment affairs. We must also judge the extent to which we have a new responsibility to protect those individuals or organisations from incompetent or improper advice or from maladministration of their investment funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are probably implicit in the clause. The words in clause 	<i>5(1)(b)</i>
	<br><q><p>"subject to its rules in carrying on investment business incidentally to that practice"</p></q>
subsume the question of scale and the other matters referred to in the amendment of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). We should not unduly inhibit the right of professionals to give advice by making them consider whether they are transgressing the provisions of the Bill. However, we have a responsibility to ensure that professional firms offering a comprehensive investment service either package it so that it has to be separately authorised, or are aware that it forms a significant part of their business. We must see how it works in practice and learn from our experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like merchant banks, many British international firms of accountants seem to be expanding to provide a range of financial services. Some accountancy firms have an integrated private clients' department for such services. Their fundamental business is accountancy, but they also offer a tax planning service. That service involves contingencies and maintaining reserve funds on which investment advice must be given. They may often say that that should be done at arm's length by a specialist institution, but at least as often they may have arrangements with insurance companies and other financial firms and may channel the funds in one direction rather than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to moot the matter in Committee and ask the Minister to be aware of the changing trends in the professions, which no longer simply provide one professional service. The clause is aimed at businesses with a substantial involvement in investment advice. "Substantial" may mean a large amount of money in one case, or many small sums in individual cases dealt with by a solicitor or an accountant. In either case it is important that firms forming part of a profession and individual practitioners are aware that when investment advice becomes a significant part of their business—and "significant" cannot be absolutely defined—they must seek an alternative form of authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary feels that there are compelling reasons to accept the amendments, I should not be inclined to do so. However, they raise the interesting point about the extent to which the professional bodies will institute new rules to oversee and govern the investment activities—be they incidental or substantial—of their members. There are also implications for the membership of ruling bodies of the professions. If these firms are to have increasing involvement, even in an incidental way, in investment business, there should be a lay membership on the ruling bodies. I do not know whether that is possible under their charters and statutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point that has not been mentioned is the attitude of investors towards those giving advice. There is a danger that a prospective investor who receives advice either from a solicitor or an accountant will see that adviser as a disinterested party. That is the popular perception of solicitors and accountants: they are not giving investment advice for some dirty motive of their own, which is how people may view other sources of investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That behoves us to be extra careful in how we look at the regulations applying to solicitors and accountants. Earlier in the proceedings, I expressed anxiety that we had excluded financial journalists from the scope of the Bill. That is a pity, but I shall not raise the matter again. There is now a danger that we shall be reinforcing opportunities for people to receive advice, which may or may not be competent or substantial in relation to the practice or the person giving that advice. But, above all, it will be taken as gospel truth by the investor, who might question advice from his stockbroker, or the manager of his portfolio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the amendment, and whether it is necessary. I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) in that respect. This clause, and those immediately following, take us into territory which causes us anxiety about the protection of investors, because investors may be excessively trusting in their attitude towards solicitors and accountants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments relate to an important aspect of the Bill's provisions, which presents some difficulties, and we have had a useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two essential points have been made. The point arising from the amendment of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) relates to the concept denoted by the word "incidentally", and whether it is an adequate concept for the purposes that it seeks to achieve. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) seeks to import into the clause a quantitative concept related to scale. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) that the proposal of the hon. Member for Dagenham is already contained within the scope of the clause, although I do not agree that that also applies to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the amendments in turn. The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Dagenham seeks to define what is to constitute incidental investment business for the purpose of this and subsequent clauses. I do not disagree with the spirit of his amendment. Investment business, which forms a major part of a professional practice cannot be said to be carried on incidentally to that practice, and the Government do not intend it to be so regarded. The provisions, as drafted, secure that result. The word "incidentally" implies that the business should be a minor part of the practice's activity, and that it is not central to the practice. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would go further and exclude from the definition investment business that was clearly incidental to the practice of the profession, but which, because of the sheer size of the partnership, was substantial in an absolute sense. That would go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In achieving that effect, it would be approaching the effect which my hon. Friend the Member for Beacons-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
field seeks to achieve by his amendment, which would explicitly incorporate a reference to scale. That provision is not desirable. There seems no reason in principle to suppose that a professional body, capable of monitoring the conduct of investment business up to a specific limit, should be incapable of doing so above that limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, the Secretary of State or the designated agency may conclude that a body's regulatory systems provided adequate investor protection only if its members carried on investment business up to a specific amount. In such a case, he or it could refuse recognition, if there was no rule limiting members to that amount of investment business, on the ground that, without such a rule, the level of investor protection was inadequate. But it does not seem desirable to require such a rule in all circumstances, if it is not needed for investment protection purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that it is no more than we should expect from the Minister and his profession that he should seek not to define such matters, as it leaves them open for lawyers to argue in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is reluctant to define the word "incidental", what criteria will be used on making the judgment here? Are we talking of a percentage of the amount of work done by the firm, or by the total amount? If it were the percentage, the hon. and learned Gentleman must accept that large firms could have a low percentage, but give a great deal of advice on substantial sums. If it were the latter, the reverse might apply and although the sum was small in global terms, it could represent a high percentage of the firm's work. How does the Minister expect the courts to make their judgments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "incidental" introduces the concept of relativity. The investment business must be a minor part of the business, in comparison with the major part of the business, its professional activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) referred to percentages. I would not expect the courts to insist on a particular percentage, but it is the relationship of the investment activities to the professional activities of the business, that is central to the concept of the word "incidental". That is why I prefer "incidental" to "substantial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked about likely candidates for recognition. I have a list of professional bodies that is, to some extent, speculative, as some have not so far said that they will seek status as recognised professional bodies, and not all may wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list, for what it is worth, includes the three law societies, of England and Wales, of Scotland, and of Northern Ireland; the three institutes of chartered accountants, with which my hon. Friend is particularly familiar; two institutes of actuaries, for England and Wales and for Scotland; the Association of Certified Accountants; the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants; the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy; the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
I acknowledge that not all those bodies will seek the status of recognised professional bodies or would be granted it if they did, but they have been identified as possible candidates, and amount to the figure of about a dozen to which my hon. Friend referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. and learned Friend was speaking, the question arose of whether the professional status should be confined to chartered bodies, or those similarly recognised, as the licensing arrangement could exclude people who do not come within the general category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend knows from proceedings on another Bill, I am legal adviser to the Society of Company and Commercial Accountants. As there is some uncertainty about what is and what is not a profession, will my hon. and learned Friend keep an open mind on recognising bodies other than those included in the dozen referred to in paragraph 2.20 of the SIB document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My mind is always open and I am happy to respond positively to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, but the Committee will appreciate that to decide whether a body is eligible is only to surmount the first hurdle. The next hurdle is that to be erected by SIB or the designated agency. We have some suggestion of the nature and context of those requirements from the passage to which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by my hon. and learned Friend's comments. He appeared to say that my amendment was unnecessary but I do not under stand how the matter can be dealt with in practice other than by a monetary definition or a definition that uses numbers. How can one draw the line between "significant" and "insignificant" without some percent age or absolute figure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that it does not need an amendment to allow SIB to introduce a rule, but I cannot understand why my hon. and learned Friend objects to my amendment. I am reinforced in my view by the discovery during the debate that although the ICA queried what the phrase meant the amendment came from SIB, which said:
	<br><q><p>"It believes that the requirement"</p></q>
—in the clause—
	<br><q><p>"that investment business done by members should be 'incidental' to their main professional practice is helpful but does not go far enough; in some large practices even incidental' business may be very significant."</p></q>
SIB went on to argue for the inclusion of the two words in my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my hon. and learned Friend's argument that SIB can introduce a rule, but that is true elsewhere. We should accept the amendment and make the provision clear. Will my hon. and learned Friend say how the matter can be dealt with other than by using figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sought to say in reply to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) that there were two possible approaches, but I agree that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. One approach is to say that as long as the investment business carried out by a professional person or partnership is incidental to the firm's professional activities it should gain the benefit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
of the provisions without regard to any quantitative limit. The other is to argue that the test should be quantitative with reference to the words "scale", "substantial" or other term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. Member for Yeovil that the Government believes that the statutory approach, which is preferable, should be a concept of relativity. It should be relative, to the professional activities of the person or partnership, not to the scale of business. However, we should leave open the possibility that the designated agency may in some circumstances, but not as a universal rule, consider that in a particular case it would be helpful to have additional requirements defined with reference to a quantitative limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explanation makes clearer what I sought to explain before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard all that, but I cannot understand what relativity means. In the end it seems to come down to the same thing. People in the business will want to know what relative and incidental mean and how to work out the difference. For example, if, from X amount of turnover, some is gained from investment advice, is that business incidental and where is the dividing line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be perfectly possible for a large firm of, say, solicitors—I shall pluck a name out of the air and cite Clarke Wilmott and Clarke—to have business that was entirely incidental under the test of relativity handled by one person. That person would be the sole source of that advice. If that were his sole business, surely it would be more appropriate if he were registered in a more formal fashion and not merely registered as a member of a recognised body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. If one person is employed full-time, the firm would probably do better to hive off that activity and to have direct authorisation for it. I do not want to press this point because SIB will still be able to make rules involving scale if it wants to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we were discussing these matters it dawned on me that those who are not satisfied with advice they have had or with investments they have been advised to purchase might seek to bring legal action against their advisers. Clause 5(1 	<i>)(b)</i> states that contracts
	<br><q><p>"shall be unenforceable against the other party; and that party shall be entitled to recover any money or other property paid or transferred by him under the agreement, together with interest on any such money."</p></q>
That means that if any people suddenly decide that the advice that they had was not good and that they wanted to pull out of the contract, they might be able to use the clause to seek to prove that the person who gave them that advice was authorised wrongly or not at all. In refusing to give a clear parameter as guidance for people seeking investment advice the Minister is giving those who may wish to pull out of a contract a good way of doing so. All they have to do is to challenge the authorisation arrangements, which they will do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was fair and correct when he said that we had had a useful debate. I am not sure that the outcome is necessarily all that we want, but I am sure the issue should have been debated because it is important and causes great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) was right that the volume of investment business carried out especially by solicitors and perhaps by other professionals can be large. Many years ago when I was in practice I was in a firm that had clients with money to invest which they were often persuaded to invest in a trust fund run by the solicitors' firm. Other clients wished to borrow money, and the solicitor would use the trust fund money to lend to those other clients. That is substantial investment business in the fullest sense of the word. As services grow more comprehensive and distinctions between one type of service and another break down, that must grow apace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the point that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) was driving at, but we cannot rely on the sheer expertise and experience arising from the volume of work. If that were so, we would not be bothering with the Bill. It is designed to introduce a regulatory system that ensures that people are obliged to meet certain standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the means by which that is to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is about where we draw the line. There is little dispute over the fact that we do not want to pull into the net thousand of accountants and solicitors who offer investment advice incidentally and in a minor way. Paragraph 21 of schedule 1 shows that business that is necessarily incidental to the provision of professional services is totally exempt. Therefore, we have already got rid of one category of incidental business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then have to decide what is left that will be authorised by the provisions but which is still only "incidental," and it is that which gives us cause for concern. The Minister says that the matter has nothing to do with scale. He is setting his face against importing any notion of scale into the test, either absolutely or proportionately. At times he mentioned the word relativity, but I am not sure that that was exactly what he meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By "incidental", perhaps the Minister did not have in mind numbers, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) thought—the Minister will not accept any potential reference to numbers—but rather a causal relationship between the main body of professional services being offered and the incidental nature of the investment business. That is what I understood him to mean. As several hon. Members have pointed out, that would not exclude from the definition of "incidental" a substantial quantity of business. That is the first problem causing us anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we accept the Minister's definition of "incidental", we are still left with the puzzle that what is necessarily "incidental" is already dealt with by schedule 1, and, therefore, we are considering what is voluntarily incidental—something that people choose to provide in addition to their normal range of professional services. That is what will be authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such business is not necessarily part of their professional services, and there is no test of scale, we can see why there is anxiety about the potential ambit of the provisions, and of the gateway into authorisation. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield in respect of his amendment, but we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
like the Minister to show greater recognition of the problem. I am sure that he sees the problem, and, presumably, we agree largely about the overall structure, but perhaps he has not yet seen the pitfalls in the concept of "incidental", which is the crux of the issue. It would help the Committee substantially if the Minister were more willing to consider the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, for example, and the import of a concept of scale, either absolutely or proportionately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I see whether I can help the hon. Gentleman by putting a couple of examples to him. My starting point is that expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), who said that we should not be keen to interfere with the wide range of activity carried on at present, apparently in a perfectly satisfactory fashion. Recognition of professinal bodies is not intended to be a soft option, as the SIB document makes clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can consider one or two examples closely related to the test of necessity, which we examined earlier when we were considering what kind of advice would be excluded from the scope of the Bill. Let us suppose that someone went to see a solicitor, to obtain advice on arranging his activities to minimise liability for capital transfer tax. If the solicitor gave general advice about the kind of investments that could be made to achieve that objective, but without specifying a particular company's insurance policy, for example, the kind of advice given would be necessarily incidental to the provision of advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone went to see an accountant, to gain advice about capital gains tax, he might be advised to buy or sell shares at a particular time. If that advice did not extend to the particular shares that should be bought or sold, it would be necessarily incidental and would be excluded from the definition of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us then suppose that the professional person went further. His advice would be necessarily incidental if, when asked for advice on capital transfer tax planning, he suggested simply that the investor might take out a particular kind of insurance policy, referring to the policies only generically, without identifying the products of a particular company. But, if he went beyond that and said, "This company produces a particularly good policy for that purpose", that would no longer be necessarily incidental, so it would not be excluded from the definition of investment business. It would be incidental, but it would be the sort of business that would require a separate authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a client went to a solicitor, accountant, or whomever primarily to seek professional advice during which he also received investment advice that was not necessary for the purpose of the professional advice, it would come within the scope of incidental business. If people started going to an accountant or solicitor primarily to get investment advice, it would be less likely to come within that concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those observations have clarified what we think is the appropriate concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Minister has tried to help the committee. I understand the point that he is making, but it does not make me more comfortable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
with the reliance that is to be placed on the concept of incidental business. It turns—as I invited the Minister to explain—on nice distinctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that difficult lines would have to be drawn with any such concept. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) correctly said that a number of important questions may turn on it, including the enforceability of contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I intended to deal with the important, if—with respect—misconceived, point raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of recognised professional bodies would be authorised for all their investment business. Therefore, if they gave investment advice that was not incidental, the contract would not be unenforceable under clause 5, to which the hon. Gentleman drew our attention. It would breach the rules of the recognised professional body. If someone suffered a loss from that breach of the rules, he could take action under clause 57. The contract would not automatically become unenforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that elaboration and elucidation, but again it increases our anxiety. It suggests that the distinction between being authorised under those provisions and being authorised or unauthorised under other provisions will not be as important as in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person who is not authorised, because he is neither a member of an SRO nor directly authorised, will attract the provisions of clause 5, but someone who is authorised by his membership of a recognised professional body to carry out incidental investment business will not, if he undertakes business that is not incidental, be subject to clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone who is not authorised to carry out any investment business runs the risk of clause 5. That is clearly right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who is authorised to carry out some investment business, whether by membership of an SRO, by direct authorisation, or by membership of a recognised professional body, but carries out investment business beyond the scope of that authorisation will not fall foul of clause 5, but of clause 57. That is entirely consistent and sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing the fact that it is consistent and comprehensible. However, it illustrates again the unease that many people, including the Securities and Investments Board itself, feel about the enforceability of some of the provisions for recognised professional bodies, and about the effectiveness of the regulation. The Minister himself used the phrase "soft option". He said that it is not intended to be a soft option, but many people, including the SIB, fear that it may be a soft option unless it is kept within rigorous bounds.

The Minister is unwilling to accept the notion of scale as a relevant criterion and I do not know whether his Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) wishes to press his view. Outside the Committee it has been suggested—for example, by the Law Society of Scotland—that perhaps some concept of the manner in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
which the business is carried out and in which the advice is provided should have some weight when it is decided by which route authorisation should be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began to hint at that course when he switched his attention from the incidental nature of the business to the primary purpose of the client. The Minister appeared to suggest that some aspect of the relationship between the provider of advice and his client would be deeply affected by the client's purpose in seeking advice and might also affect the question of significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the plainly difficult and unsatisfactory concept of being incidental, the Bill should contain a tighter control irrespective of whether it is achieved through "scale", "principal purpose" or the manner in which the business is conducted or the advice offered. Some further provision is required. We did not intend to press the amendment to a Division because we wanted simply to have a debate to examine the question, but we may divide if the Minister cannot tell us a little more, subject of course to what his hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now clear that there are three possibilities on advice given by a professional person. First, it can be necessarily incidental, when it falls outside the scope of the Bill. Secondly, it can be not necessarily incidental, but none the less incidental. Thirdly, it can be not incidental at all and mainstream investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen with the middle category of incidental advice that is significant? The White Paper referred to a "significant" part of a firm's activities. I understand what my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said, but he did not explain what would happen when an accountant advised a client not just to sell £X thousand of shares to take advantage of the annual capital gains tax exemption but also to sell X, Y and Z shares. The fee for tax advice may be £100 but the commission for selling the shares may be £200. Although investment advice may be an incidental part of a business, the resulting income may be significant. I do not believe that that happens but we are discussing the theory of what could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to press the amendment to a Division because I believe that if it wishes SIB will be able to introduce a rule importing scale, but, in the end, the Bill will have to contain some element of scale to deal with the middle category, where incidental investment advice is none the less significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of interesting points have been made and I am happy to undertake to see whether we can do more to clarify the concept embodied in the word "incidental".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that I am not persuaded by anything that I have heard that it would be helpful to introduce any test of scale or quantitative test into the definition, but it may be possible to introduce a greater element of clarity into the thinking behind the use of the word "incidental".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's offer is most acceptable. I understand that he is giving no undertakings, nor do we undertake not to return to the issue on Report.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
We wait to hear the Minister's proposals and on that understanding I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to return to the problems dealt with by the amendments, which can be approached in a much more simplistic and clear-cut fashion. We should omit the clause entirely, thus ensuring that the professional bodies came under the rules and regulations of SIB. That seems to be the most simple and straight forward solution to the problem of definition. As the Minister spoke. I had a nightmare vision of endless arguments in court about the primary purpose of a visit to the solicitor and the intention of the client, with countless grey areas leading to dispute and litigation—all providing work for lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Surely, therefore, it would be simpler to delete the clause and provide common rules to cover all aspects of investment advice whether given by professional solicitors and professional accountants or given by financial institutions which will be subject to the regulation. Solicitor's practice rules specify:
	<br><q><p>"It is, however, no part of the solicitor's duty, in the absence of special instructions, to advise his clients on matters of business. Thus a solicitor is under no duty to advise his client whether a sale is a prudent one or whether an independent valuation is desirable: and a solicitor who had been instructed to advise a client on the terms of a lease and did so with all propriety was held not to be negligent in failing subsequently to remind the client that the date for exercising his option to terminate the lease was approaching. A solicitor is under no duty to advise his client not to exchange contracts before the mortgage is arranged, but he should warn him of the risk involved. It would seem that when a client consults with his solicitor on a matter of business as a preliminary step, before the legal action required of the solicitor can be decided upon, inferences of negligence will not necessarily be drawn if the advice proves mistaken—so long at least as it was given pursuant to an honest belief."</p></q>
Having to decide what is the "honest belief of the solicitor and the intention of the client is another grey area. It has been ruled that where a solicitor has given financial advice that has proved to be misguided or downright harmful, he is not responsible for that advice. The precedent for that was a case called Bowdage v Harold Michelmore & Company in 1962 where a games mistress took advice from her solicitor on a property matter. When the advice proved to be mistaken. Mr. Justice Melford Stevenson ruled that the solicitor was not responsible for the advice, on the ground that it was incidental to the main purpose of the case. Therefore, there is no satisfactory way of getting redress against solicitors when their financial advice proves to be misguided. That is why it is simpler to omit the clause altogether and make solicitors subject to specific rules for the financial side of their business. It is interesting that both the Consumers' Association and the National Consumer Council are in favour of leaving out the clause. The National Consumer Council argued initially in its response to the White Paper that solicitors and accountants should be directly subjected to the proposed legislation. Why has that not happened? Is it part of the Government's usual timorous deference to professional bodies—the same as that which led the Lord Chancellor to act as the provisional wing of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
Law Society when he refused to allow building societies to undertake conveyancing work? The Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor's legal officers had promised both myself and the House that building societies would be allowed to undertake conveyancing work. It is curious that the Law Society, flexing its muscles, could bring the Government to their knees in a way that the NUM was incapable of doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a suspicion that the Government's attitude is conditioned by deference to a vested professional interest which is so strongly represented both in the Cabinet and in the Conservative party itself. That is an ignoble motive so it would be better to rescue the Government from that imputation by deleting the clause completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment advice is for many practices a major feature of their business and existing rules and safeguards—particularly where solicitors are concerned—are inadequte to provide the same protection as is required for other investment advice under the Bill. Even if the rules were revised to make them satisfactory, how much faith could we have in the professional bodies' willingness to discipline their members on investment matters, when they have been so inadequate in disciplining them on professional matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society, particularly, has a dual role: it is a trade union, pushing the vested interests of its members—and getting a sympathetic ear from the Lord Chancellor—and, at the same time, attempting to assure the public that their interests are being defended by disciplining the same members. In the past, the trade union aspect has been the dominant part of the Law Society's work. It has, on the whole, been occupied in defending the interests of its members rather than those of the public. The changes introduced by the Administration of Justice Act 1985 were inadequate to meet the problem. Moreover, the Coopers and Lybrand report to the Law Society recommended an independent framework to allow an independent review of complaints against solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such reforms are necessary in professional matters, how much more important are they essential in financial matters? And how much more necessary is the safeguard of proper control and regulation under the Bill in the many grey areas and matters of dispute that have been mentioned by the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no confidence in the willingness or the ability of the professional bodies to do that which would, rightly, be expected of them, if they are to provide the same protection and guarantees for investors that other financial institutions will be required to give. If that confidence does not exist, it will be necessary to strike out clause 15 so that the professional bodies will be made subject to the same rules as other investing and advising institutions. That would be the most direct way to achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deletion of clause 15 is necessitated by public scepticism about the professional bodies. There is widespread unease about their ability and willingness to impose discipline even on members' normal work. How much greater must that unease be about the bodies' ability to impose discipline where the work is incidental to their normal work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
The National Consumers Council Book "In Dispute with Your Solicitor" identifies the need for an independent body to deal with complaints; if that is needed on professional matters it is needed on financial matters also, but because the work is incidental to their professional work, practices do not have the skill or the experience that an external regulator would provide. They would not attach the necessary importance to the subject, and as for most practices financial advice will be incidental, it is unlikely that they will develop the necessary skill, as it will not be very important to them professionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A professional body will be reluctant to discipline a member for an offence that falls outside the scope of its normal, regulatory function. It is easier to remove investment business from professional regulation and make it subject to the regulations of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, professional bodies have been reluctant to assume powers to make awards of compensation against their members. However, such awards will be essential if the consumer is to be properly safeguarded when seeking investment advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional bodies have also resisted public accountability. They do not publish enough information about professional procedures or disciplinary cases. The public is not well-informed enough to know the rules and how to make use of them. The procedures are part of the old-boy, professional camaraderie syndrome which has been dominant for too long, particularly in the Law Society. The SIB wants to pull the Law Society and other professional bodies kicking and struggling into the 20th century, but it will have a difficult task if they are allowed to opt out in this fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be much easier to make the investment element subject to the regulations in the Bill. That would prevent other abuses by solicitors in the financial side of their businesses. We have heard in the past few years about deputations of solicitors threatening to withdraw their money from building societies which pushed the case for such societies offering a conveyancing service. The solicitors were using clients' money, not in the clients' best interest, but to exert pressure to enhance their own professional powers and safeguard their professional role. If that is the way solicitors behave, it is important to have the safeguard of proper regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many professional bodies, and thus, as the Minister said many practices will be brought within the scope of the regulation. However, professional bodies differ in their effectiveness, discipline, and the confidence that they inspire in the public. That militates against a uniform approach. Special treatment will perpetuate demarcation among groups of professionals. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for a professional body to develop satisfactory criteria. The Minister, with his acuity has been labouring this point but is in difficulty. How much more difficult will it be for professional bodies to establish satisfactory criteria for defining the degree of investment business and the degree of regulation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that solicitors, accountants and other professionals give investment advice and carry out investment business is an argument for treating them in the same way and for giving them the same competitive advantage and tight regulation as anybody else in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
same field. It is not an argument for saying, "Here is a rather superior breed that is subject to some kind of professional old boy network." We all know that that is a cushion—a protective device—rather than a disciplinary procedure when we come to press cases against that professional discipline on behalf of our constituents. It is no use putting these people on a pedestal. If they are working in the same areas, they should compete on the same basis as everyone else and be subject to the same regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has not arrived to pull the plug on this argument too!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we ensure equivalent treatment there will be undue difficulties and complexities and it will be necessary to formulate a relationship with many bodies of professionals who need to wear many different hats. It would be much easier to cut through the Minister's equivocations and get to the nub of the problem. We could then strike out the exemption given to professional bodies and put them on the same terms as everyone else, which seems fair, just and a proper safeguard of the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it would be in order, Sir Michael for me to make some points that are relevant to clauses 15 and 20, as those clauses deal with the central issue of whether we should incorporate members of recognised professional bodies. It would speed us up if I could touch on that general point, rather than speaking on each provision as it comes up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central question is that raised by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)—whether excluding members of recognised professional bodies will ensure equivalent treatment and protection for the investor. That is a central pillar of the Government's case for the Bill, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the Government do not wish to have the extraordinary burden of having to register directly many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individual firms with the SIB. There would be a real problem with administration there, as it might swamp the resources of the SIB, and place great burdens on those firms. Nevertheless, we have to consider clause 15 and subsequent clauses in the light not only of that problem, but from the angle of whether the Government's proposal can be reasonably expected to provide equivalence of treatment in protection for the investor. That is the greatest problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence, including that evidence by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, points in the opposite direction, bearing in mind what we know to be the nature of our recognised professional bodies. Will the responsibilities that the Minister wishes to place on those bodies be honoured? The fact is that the bodies on the list that the Minister read out—and perhaps others—do not have the skills or resources in most cases to deal with regulation to provide an equivalence of protection for the investor in this case. If they do not have it now, will they acquire it in the light of responsibilities placed on them by the Bill? The Minister must concede that they will show considerable reluctance to acquire it. I do not claim that they will not do
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
it, but they will surely be reluctant to acquire adequate resources to provide equivalence of protection for the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby said that there was already substantial public dissatisfaction about the ability of many recognised professional bodies to regulate even the work that they are supposed to regulate under their present ambit. The bodies have a quality of purpose to regulate their own affairs and to represent their members—what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby called acting as a trade union. There is already considerable public concern about whether the current duties are being carried out where they cross. The Law Society has recently essentially conceded that point by agreeing to set up an independent body for complaints because of the inadequacies of the present system. That is not a history to give us much cause for confidence that if many bodies cannot regulate their own businesses effectively now, they will be able to regulate the new burdens imposed by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that many recognised professional bodies are changing and that most of them have faced up to the problem, but many remain reluctant to discipline their members for offences that fall inside their present scope, let alone those that the Government seek to place on them for which they currently have no expertise. The RPBs have in the past been reluctant to assume powers to make awards for compensation against their members. If the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) wishes to intervene I shall be happy to give way, but I am sure that he will not disagree that is a fact of life. I am not making a blanket condemnation of every professional body, but it is the background against which we must consider the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a regrettable resistance to public accountability by many recognised professional bodies. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that many of them still do not publish detailed information about their disciplinary functions under their present duties. Will they do so for the duties to be imposed upon them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester said cogently that there was inadequate lay representation on many recognised professional bodies. I ask the Minister specifically whether he is seeking equivalence of treatment for lay representation. Moreover is it true that as the hon. Member for Chichester said, the RPBs that will assume new responsibilities under the Bill will have to take on lay representation in the same way as the SROs and the SIB? I should be grateful if the Minister could comment on that question because it is of some importance to me and, I believe, to the hon. Member for Chichester and to other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried by the fact that there are already inadequate monitoring and enforcement resources in many if not all recognised professional bodies and that there is no evidence that they will take on sufficient resources to cope with the new responsibilities that the Minister seeks to place on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other reasons—I shall touch on them only briefly because the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has also mentioned them—which make the concept of exclusion from membership of recognised professional body a difficult concept. First, there are the large numbers and the difficulty of achieving a uniform approach. Secondly, there is the question of special treatment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
and of demarcation problems for those carrying out investment functions within a recognised professional body. Some RPBs with an anti-competitive slant in their conduct of their affairs might even forbid the carrying out of investment business. They might impose regulations so stringent that no one would seek to effect investment business because the burdens would be too great. The special treatment for those carrying out investment business within the recognised professional bodies must create considerable problems of definition and of demarcation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reasons behind the Minister's proposals but I am worried that they may create confusion in the professions and complexity in the laws. We had a good example of that in trying to define the wonderful concept of "incidentality." Did the Committee invent that word? Will it, God forbid, now be included in the Oxford English Dictionary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will also create obscurity in the operation of the bill. It is reasonable to conclude that it will not provide the equivalence of treatment that the Government regard as one of the important criteria of the Bill, giving investors who get their advice this way adequate protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult to frame a workable provision. On the one hand, there is no evidence to suppose that the route taken by the Minister will be workable, for the reasons I have given; on the other, it would be equally unworkable to burden the SIB with direct registration. The Minister may say that he has no intention of making this method a "soft option, or the wide gateway that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to, through which people could conduct business that would otherwise be forbidden to them. But, I suspect that however fine the Minister's intentions may be, the clause will provide a soft option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A thought occurred to me during the debate. If I had thought of it earlier, and if I had been clever enough, I should have tabled an amendment on these lines. Would there be any benefit in asking recognised professional bodies to register with those SROs which control the functions that the bodies are currently involved in?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply will be that that is unnecessary, as the bodies have to be recognised by the SIB. But I am not worried only by the initial recognition. There is also the day-to-day supervision of the rules and regulations. SIB is left in a curious nuclear deterrent position—under clause 18, again, T think—with the power to recognise and revoke, but nothing in between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The day-to-day supervision of the recognised professional bodies particularly in the early stages, is what will be important. If the Minister were to consider setting up a mechanism which would provide some supervising body to look over the recognised professional body's shoulder to ensure that it provided the equivalence of treatment required under the Bill, he would go a long way towards satisfying my anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, the Minister will not make that offer, I shall listen to his reply, and judge it in the light of other amendments that he may be bringing in, but I believe that clause 15, and the subsequent clauses 16 to 20, will prove unworkable, will not provide the equivalence of treatment we seek. They will create confusion in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
law and in the professions, and, most important, in the minds of the public, which expected benefits and virtues from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I intervene only briefly to put some new thoughts into the Minister's mind, unless he has already considered my proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is that we do not trust the Law Society and similar organisations. We all have had constituency cases, have gone to the Law Society, and have received its meaningless replies. We have therefore lost confidence. If the professional bodies are to be responsible for the activities of their members, the high standards expected of others must be implemented by the membership, and we do not believe they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be another solution. T have not tabled an amendment, but I put it to the Minister as a proposition to turn over in his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I discount the possibility of thousands of people registering directly, which is what would happen if we were to vote against the clause—although I may have to vote against the clause as I am dissatisfied with the Minister's reply to the previous amendment. Why cannot the SIB be given a reserve power to consider the matter, if an aggrieved party were to appeal? It could perhaps implement its power in clause 27 over authorised persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present mechanism allows an aggrieved person to take action for damages under clause 57, but he would have to go to court. An aggrieved person may not be able to bring a legal action. He may not understand how to go about it or he may be receiving advice from someone who is directly involved in the negligence and therefore unlikely to advise him how to pursue legal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That mechanism is not sufficient. An aggrieved party should be able to rely on an outside organisation, if the professional body were unwilling to discipline the member in the way that it would if clause 27 applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have got it wrong or simply misunderstood, but I sense that I am hitting the nub of the problem when I say that we have no faith in the professional bodies, so we want to know that there will be someone somewhere who can satisfy the customer in default of the professional organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the question of enforcement worries everyone on the Committee. I draw my hon. and learned Friend's attention to my amendment to schedule 5. I suggest that the SIB should have a statutory obligation to ensure equivalence of the enforcement of rules as well as equivalence of the rules themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SIB could tell an SRO or professional body that it is not enforcing the roles in an equivalent way, that would overcome many of the Committee's objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) show the extent of the legitimate and widely held worry about that aspect of the Bill. I share his dissatisfaction with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
the record of the professional bodies in disciplining their members. He rightly described the professional bodies as protecting their members rather than disciplining them in the interests of the consumer. My hon. friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) put his finger on the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with the problem, should we strike out clauses 15 to 20? That would deal with it, but might create a range of other problems which would overwhelm and destroy the process of authorisation under the Bill. The SIB would be unable to deal with the tens of thousands of applications for direct authorisations that would flow from striking those provisions from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be unwilling, therefore, for the sake of achieving a precise objective, to see the whole structure of authorisation brought down, as I fear it might be, if we delete those clauses. I sympathise with my hon. Friend's arguments, but I would prefer to consider more specific ways of achieving his objectives. Amendments have been tabled to clause 18, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 175.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right. Those amendments are directed specifically at the powers of enforcement. My hon. Friend for Workington and the hon. Member for Bournemouth (Mr. Butterfill) made interesting suggestions, but we should consider those more specific and directed amendments to achieve our objectives, rather than simply striking out the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sit on one of the Law Society committees with an interest in the matter. Such professional bodies as the Law Society would be recognised only if their rules provided, for their clients and the general public, protection equivalent to that which would have to be provided under the rules of an SRO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed clause 12. There are adequate safeguards in respect of that because the SRO, in conjunction with other people who will be considering those matters, will ensure that there is proper equivalence between the recognised professional bodies which acquire authorisation under the Bill, and other similar SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That disposes of the points raised by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). I regret that I was not present to hear what he said— 	<i>[Interruption]</i>—but I have the advantage of having sat with him on the Administration of Justice Bill Committee last year, and his comments have an air of predictability. I am sure that he will forgive me for making that remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor's profession is well placed to take advantage of the Bill's proposals and to comply willingly with all its provisions. The rules of the profession's members are subject to much of the protection already provided by the Bill. There is already a compulsory negligence insurance scheme and the amount for which a solicitor is covered is greater than seems likely to be provided for under the Bill. There is a compensation fund, clients' money has to be kept separately, there are strict rules on disclosure and accounting for commission, and the solicitor has a fiduciary duty to his client, and the public, and is bound to act in his best interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There are already provisions under which business conduct rules will have to be devised to deal with those situations where more appropriate tailoring of the existing rules will be made to meet the terms of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was only following a well-established Committee practice of commenting on speeches that he had not heard, and I did not understand why it provoked such a reaction from Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has made it clear that there is a widespread recognition of the need for an arrangement for professional bodies, which would avoid some of the difficulties that we have discussed. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) referred to the desirability of leaving in place arrangements which give satisfaction, and do not give rise to abuse. I take that as my starting point in considering those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it is right that we should insist on protection being afforded to investors who make use of their professional advisers, to ensure that adequate incidental investment advice is given. Although we may argue in due course about the details, clause 18 provides, in principle, at any rate, the protection that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) referred repeatedly to recognised professional bodies as though they already exist. It might have been a slip of the tongue, but it may have some significance, as such slips so often do. However, no recognised professional bodies exist at present, and they will obtain recognition only if they fulfil the requirements and meet the standards set out in clause 18. Subsection (2) ensures that a body
	<br><q><p>"maintains and enforces rules which … afford to investors protection at least equivalent to"</p></q>
the conduct of business rules
	<br><q><p>"under Chapter V of this Part of this Act".</p></q>
It ensures that a body should have:
	<br><q><p>"arrangements for enforcing its rules … and for the investigation of complaints in relation to the carrying on of that business which are adequate and secure a proper balance between the interests of its members and those of the public."</p></q>
We have already discussed the precise meaning of the phrase "proper balance" in the context of SROs. However, in principle the protection for which all hon. Members who have spoken have expressed a desire is provided in clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) spoke about the need for specific procedures to provide remedies for grievances which he said could occur. Many such safeguards are provided for in the Bill as it stands. Not only does the designated agency have to be satisfied about those matters before recognising a professional body in the first place, but it can withdraw recognition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the nuclear deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but it is not the only safeguard. The agency can revoke recognition if those safeguards do not continue to be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In answer to the hon. Member for Workington, if a member of a recognised professional body appears to have conducted himself in a way that merits investigation and the body is unwilling or unable to do so, the designated agency has the power to investigate that person under clause 92. If the designated agency felt that a recognised professional body was taking insufficient action to prevent a breach of its rules, it could seek an injunction to restrain such a breach under clause 56. Those powers are additional to what the hon. Member for Yeovil described as the nuclear deterrent, and additional to individual action on breach of rules under clause 57. Another power in clause 56 provides for a restitution order against a member of a recognised professional body if that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we can argue about the precise scope of protection, a range of remedies is available in principle which would provide sufficient safeguards to secure the protection for which hon. Members have expressed a desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I predicted, the Minister is taking shelter behind clause 18 on the matter of the granting or refusal of recognition. I am grateful to him for pointing out the two additional powers which I had not spotted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it two, but I shall take the Minister's word. I do not wish to underestimate this matter, but it is peripheral to the central point. We do not necessarily want the nuclear deterrent plus a little flexibility. How will the day-to-day operation of the recognised professional bodies be supervised to achieve equivalence of treatment for the investor? We are interested not in recognition but in supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister answer a question that has puzzled me? If, as he suggests, he is not prepared to consider the possibility of having recognised professional bodies registered with SROs, why did he follow the curious hybrid route for recognising professional bodies instead of having them register direct with the SIB? If RPBs registered direct with the SIB, the paraphernalia in the rest of the Bill for direct registration would also apply to those bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be misunderstanding the position. I hope so, because if he understands it, I do not understand his question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of powers that I identified as available to the designated agency are central to the agency's role as a supervisory body for the whole area of investor protection in the Bill. The powers to which I referred will enable the designated agency to supervise the way in which investment business is carried out by members of recognised professional bodies in the same way as the designated agency will be able to continue its supervisory role in relation to members of SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Yeovil will do me the courtesy of listening to my attempts to enlighten him, he will be more likely to understand the provision. The designated agency has the task of supervising and monitoring and ensuring that investor protection is secured by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
arrangements for both the SROs and the recognised professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers that I identified are not a curious hybrid route, as the hon. Member for Yeovil suggested. They are the same powers that will be available to the designated agency when it supervises the work of the SROs. There is consistency and parity of treatment and I believe that those powers convey the safeguards that hon. Gentlemen seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that under clause 19 the recognition order can be revoked if under clause 18(2)(Z>) there is no continuance of the enforcement of the rules? That is the very point that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) raised when he referred to supervisory functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is agreement on both sides of the Committee that that nuclear deterrent is available. I sought to convey the existence of a wide range of conventional artillery in addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Minister, I am filled with optimism about his attitude to amendment No. 88. Will the Minister say now whether he will accept that amendment, as his acceptance would transform the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If only because the contents of amendment No. 88 are remote from my mind at present, I must decline the invitation so generously extended by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons that I sought to convey—having regard to the range of powers available to the designated agency in supervising the work of the recognised professional bodies and their members when they seek to carry out investment business—I suggest that in principle the Bill provides the necessary powers to ensure adequate investor protection and that clause 15 and the other clauses that we have discussed with it should remain part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My disappointment with the Minister's is now a traditional routine in Committee. He should pay more attention to the tutorials conducted by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). The honourable and learned Gentleman's marks are only reaching B or C level, and we would like them to be higher by the end of our proceedings on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said that he sensed that he was approaching the nub of the argument, I told him that he would be able to tell if he had, as the Minister would rise with his red book and start reading from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remember when the honourable and learned Gentleman advocates, "Trust the lawyers" that he is one and does not need the red book. He can put himself on automatic pilot, representing as he does a system of government of the legal profession, for the legal profession, by the legal profession, which has taken over the reins of power in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the change. Solicitors are moving increasingly into financial business; they are now advertising their financial advice on radio and in the newspapers. That is an inevitable concomitant of the Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
argument that building societies should not do conveyancing because that provides a conflict of interest and people need independent financial advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitors are now setting themselves up to provide that independent financial advice. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham painted a picture of the profession as it was when he played a distinguished part in it, but that is changing rapidly, and we shall see solicitors undertaking much more financial activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the change, as it is part of the adjustment of the profession to competition and the 20th century. We are getting a more entrepreneurial legal profession, but if we do, there have to be safeguards, and those must be the same as the safeguards that every other financial business will be subject to under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the argument on clause 15 is not contained in the blithe assurances of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), speaking as the voice of the Law Society. I did not like to interrupt his reading; indeed. I was not able to do so. Those assurances are not satisfactory. If the Law Society has been so slow in providing proper safeguards, proper independent review and appeal procedure on professional matters, which must be the heart of its concern, how much more laggardly will it be on financial business, which is only one aspect of its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commenting on the Law Society's proposals to date, the chairman of the National Consumer Council, Mr. Montague, said two days ago,
	<br><q><p>"I entirely tail to see how an independent and separate body could be set up within the Law Society. The option which is being recommended ducks the requirements of independence and freedom from conflicts of role and interest which were set by the Society's own management consultants".—</p></q>
the Coopers and Lybrand report—
	<br><q><p>"The proposal Hies in the face of public opinion which has clearly indicated a wish for complaints handling to be taken out of the hands of the Law Society. A truly independent body is bound to come sooner or later: why not now?"</p></q>
If the society is that laggardly on professional matters, how much more difficult will it be to push it into proper control and proper regulation of the financial aspects of a solicitor's practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask that question, as I am sure that the SIB wants provisions for the financial aspects of legal businesses that are better than the provisions in force for its professional aspects. Amendments were tabled to clause 18, specifically and I hope most attractively, amendment No. 175, to ensure that the safeguards for financial business are better than those for professional business. Unless there is enforcement, I cannot see the Law Society—and other professional bodies—going far enough. We should have liked from the Minister an assurance that the safeguards required of professional bodies in respect of financial business will be better than those required for professional matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wanted outside review and independent appeal of some kind, rather than the traditional schizophrenia produced in bodies that act partly as trade unions, and partly as defenders of the national interest—two roles which are impossible to combine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happier if the Minister had said that, but we can return to the issue when we deal with the amendments to clause 18, and on Report. If satisfactory provisions have not been included by that stage, it will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
be necessary to knock out that independence because it will become a soft option, if we can judge from professional bodies' handling of professional business. Perhaps, therefore, we should not vote against the clause at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is purely a drafting point, which the Law Society of Scotland drew to my attention. It fears—and I suspect that it is right—that the phrase "carrying on investment business" may refer to the members rather than the rules, to which it was no doubt intended to refer. That phrase may. therefore, define a category of people, rather than the ambit of the rules. On a strict reading of the Bill, that is no doubt true, but I am not convinced that it is especially important. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether he thinks that it is a worthwhile amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the amendments are necessary.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight, the thrust of the amendment may appear to be contrary to the arguments advanced by myself and my hon. Friends, but I must make it clear that it is largely a probing amendment and can be used as an instrument for further elucidating the Minister's thinking on the circumstances in which a professional body will be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aspect of the provision which has attracted our attention is that, unlike other similar provisions—for example, clause 26, in respect of the authorisation of individual applicants—the language here is permissive, rather than mandatory. In other cases, the Secretary of State, when satisfied of a point, "shall" authorise or recognise; in this case, perhaps uniquely, even where he believes that specific conditions are met, he is nevertheless permitted, rather than required, to make the recognition order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>275</span>
That immediately suggests that Opposition Members were right in thinking that the category of recognised professional bodies differs substantially from other authorisations provided by the procedures in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fine, but, if that is not the case, we need to know what other criteria the Secretary of State would take into account in deciding whether to exercise that permissive power. Would there be criteria beyond the terms of clause 18(2)? The Minister may be about to tell me that the provision is not different from the others. However, if it is different, why is it? Why is it a permissive rather than mandatory power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is different from some of the other provisions, but not from all of them. Contrary to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, it is not unique. He will find similar provisions for investment exchanges and clearing houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives the Secretary of State or the designated agency a discretion to refuse to recognise a professional body even if it meets the specified criteria. However, that discretion is limited. The Secretary of State has to act properly and not unreasonably. A limited discretion is desirable because there is no explicit discretion—as there is in the case of SROs—to refuse recognition on the grounds that it is unnecessary because of the existence of other recognised bodies and SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A body with few members that carried on investment business might apply to the Secretary of State or the designated agency. Its enforcemer.t procedures might be satisfactory, but recognition of the body might mislead investors. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State or the designated agency might have good grounds for exercising his or its discretion and refusing to recognise the body. The permissive nature of the power thus introduces a desirable flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. But why is it not preferable to introduce a needs requirement into the Bill for professional bodies, investment exchanges, and clearing houses as well as for SROs? Section 10(4) allows the Secretary of State or the designated agency to take into account whether there is a need for an SRO in a particular area. I have tabled amendment No. 35 to import a similar requirement into the recognition of an investment exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of a vague permissive power that leaves open the question of what criteria the SIB might take into account in addition to those specified, it would be better to specify a needs requirement, as has been done in those other cases, to make it clear what the Secretary of State has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of SROs it is possible to identify the circumstances in which it would be undesirable to grant recognition. The Bill provides for those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With professional bodies we are less confident of our ability to identify such circumstances in advance. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
is why the Secretary of State or the designated agency is entrusted with a wider discretion for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what I and my hon. Friends said in an earlier debate. I am pleased about that discretion. It allows the sorts of criteria that the Minister has identified to be taken into account. That is valuable. My only quarrel is that it should be more pecific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to that point under clause 36. which deals with the recognition of investment exchanges, so I shall bear the Minister's remarks in mind and leave further debate until we reach that clause. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86. in page 12, line 21, after "may", insert
	<br><q><p>"on such conditions as to changes in the rules referred to in subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) below as he may specify".</p></q>
The amendment returns to the question that has bothered some members of the Committee—the finite and conclusive nature of the process of authorisation or recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us have worried that once that hurdle is overcome, the SIB or designated agency will be able to exercise the nuclear deterrent but have little intermediate powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to give the Secretary of State or the designated agency the power to specify the changes in rules needed to allow recognition of a professional body and is designed to compress what might otherwise be a rather awkward and long drawn-out process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present if the Secretary of State or the designated agency is unhappy about some of the rules he or it must say. "No." I expect that the Secretary of State or the designated agency will then informally consult the professional body to see whether it can bring its rules into line with what is required so that it can make a renewed application. I suggest that that process can be telescoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 88 were accepted, the designated agency might be able to insist subsequently on a change in the rules, which might help to ease the problem. However, we do not yet know whether amendment No. 88 is acceptable to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to give the SIB greater flexibility to make recognition conditional on certain changes in the rules thereby enabling everyone to resolve a difficult problem in one procedure, rather than spinning out a series of abortive negotiations, applications, refusals and reapplications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would allow the Secretary of State or designated agency to recognise a professional body on condition that it made specified changes to its rules. I do not dissent from the general proposition that some professional bodies at least will need to change their rules if the requirements laid down in this clause are to be met. but I do not think the amendment is required to achieve that effect. If a professional body applies for recognition and its rules are inadequate to provide the necessary level of investor protection, its application could be refused. The notice of refusal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
would specify the grounds on which the application was refused. It would then be open to the professional body to amend its rules to overcome the objections raised and to apply again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, professional bodies—like SROs—are likely to consult the Secretary of State or designated agency closely about their rules before submitting a formal application. This will give the Secretary of State or designated agency an opportunity to indicate which of the professional body's rules he or it believes need to be altered to comply with the requirements of the clause. The professional body would not. of course, be obliged to comply with suggestions made during such consultations, but if it did not. ii would know that its application for recognition was likely to be refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a particular problem for some professional bodies in that, for reasons to do with their constitution, they may not be able to make the necessary changes in their rules before the main provisions of the Bill come into effect. Examples are the Law Society, some of whose rules are laid down in legislation, and the Institution of Chartered Accountants, changes in whose rules have to be approved by the Privy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of schedule 11 provides a special transitional regime for such bodies. They will be able to obtain interim recognition, but only on the basis that satisfactory rules will be introduced within a specified period. If they are not. the interim recognition will automatically lapse at the end of:he period. To protect investors during this period, interim recognition will be available only if the Secretary of State or designated agency is satisfied that during the period the body will enforce its existing rules to give investor protection as nearly equivalent as possible to that provided by the main regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear the Minister recognise that this could be a difficult area. Indeed, it has occupied the Committee throughout the sitting. There will clearly be problems in ensuring that all the professional bodies in the Ministers list obtain authorisation in good lime and with an adequate body of rules, but I am satisfied that the Minister and I are in agreement in our aims and I am hopeful that the procedures outlined will meet our objectives. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 193. in page 12, line 26, leave out "is" and insert
	<br><q><p>"it or its officers arc".</p></q>
This is a purely technical and probing amendment in that the requirements under clause 18(2) for a recognition order to be made by the Secretary of State include a requirement that the body concerned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
	<br><q><p>"regulates the practice of a profession in the exercise of statutory powers or is recognised (otherwise than under this Act) for any other statutory purpose by a Minister of the Crown".</p></q>
I have a purely technical point on which I seek clarification. In many cases professional bodies that might otherwise be considered appropriate for recognition— including my own body, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors—are recognised for statutory purposes through the recognition of an officer of that body rather than the body itself. Often, responsibility is delegated by statute to the president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary would not intend that technicality to rule out the qualification of such a body, and I would be grateful if he would clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's concerns. I can assure him that the Government have no intention of introducing provisions which would have the effect that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors could not apply for recognition under the Bill. I am advised that the institution is in fact recognised under both the Insurance Companies Regulations 1981 and the Evidence by Certificate Rules 1961. and so it would appear that it satisfies the test in the subsection as drafted. I believe that if these provisions are passed in their present form the institution would be able to apply for recognition. It would, of course, be recognised only if the Secretary of State or designated agency were satisfied that it met the other conditions laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend, but I would ask him to consider whether an alteration on the lines of my amendment might be necessary to cover a similar problem with any other body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that it is not necessary. If any such body came to us and was able to persuade us that such a change was necessary to meet its concerns, we would consider that most sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
