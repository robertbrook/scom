	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [	<i>1 May</i>], No. 23, in page 4, line 18, to leave out the word "and".—[	<i>Dr. Marek.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 24, in page 4, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(e) all persons providing drugs, medicines or appliances as defined by this Act prior to the establishment of the list for the particular locality in which the provision is made shall be included on that list.".</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 31, in page 5, line 41, leave out " and ".</p>
	<p>No. 32, in page 5, line 43, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>(e) all persons providing drugs, medicines or appliances as defined by this Act prior to the establishment of the list for the particular locality in which the provision is made shall be included on that list.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Ray Whitney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of our last sitting, I was explaining that the anxiety expressed by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) was unjustified, and that we share the amendment's objective. I was explaining that the necessary or desirable test would apply only to new applications, although a current contractor seeking a major relocation of his pharmacy would be subject also to the new arrangements. But it would be unfair to new applicants to exempt current contractors in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham was worried about the information that would be available. I am happy to assure the Committee that the regulations will provide for the continuation of the existing list. So there is no problem- about the availability of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson (Holborn and St. Pancras)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(f) That sums distributed in respect of persons ceasing to provide drugs, medicines or appliances shall not exceed, in any individual case, the net annual remuneration previously received by the person from such provision.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 34, in page 5, line 43, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>" 	<i>(g)</i> that sums distributed in respect of persons ceasing to provide drugs, medicines or appliances shall not exceed, in any individual case, the net annual remuneration previously received by the person from such provision.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again is a probing amendment. The Minister may recall, although he was not responsible for the decision, when the Department of Health and Social Security tried to persuade National Health Service staff to retire early. I suppose that was a reasonable objective, but the inducements that were offered resulted in many people leaving. The health authorities had misjudged how many staff they needed to retain and, consequently, lost more staff than they intended under the accelerated retirement arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health authorities ended up in the barmy position of paying the staff lump sum pension payments and so on, and re-recruiting them, which was not the object of the exercise. It meant that most of them were paid twice as much as they received before the cost-saving exercise began. Therefore, the arrangements made to induce small chemist shop operators to give up their businesses should not be so attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fear that useful chemist shops might be located where there are no easily-accessible alternatives, and that the severance terms will be so broad and generous that they will induce such people to give up those businesses when it would be better for their local community if they stayed on in business. In short, that is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that our proposition that the compensation should not exceed one year's net annual remuneration is necessarily the right way to do it. That sum might be too low and might be unfair to some who give up their business. So far we have seen no evidence in the discussion documents, in the documentation provided to people involved in pharmaceutical sales nor in our debates that the Government recognise that the severance payment scheme might have a bad effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that we support the Government's objective of getting pharmacies evenly spread by not providing subsidies that would cause an uneven spread. Rather than speak at length now, I should prefer to hear what the Minister has to say about the sensitivity of his proposition and the Government's proposals to the problem that we have raised. On an earlier amendment, the Government said that a subsection had been included as a prudent contingency provision to cover " the possibility that". Some prudent contingency provision is needed in this arrangement to ensure that the Government's reasonable objectives rather than an accidental and damaging by-product will be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the honourable Member for Holborn St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) supports the basic approach to the scheme. I wish to reassure him of the soundness of the proposals. Whatever might or might not have gone wrong in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
terms of a reduction in NHS staff in the circumstances described by the honourable Gentleman, there is no analogy in these arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new contract for pharmacists includes a temporary scheme which enables those contractors adversely affected by the new contract package to relinquish their NHS contracts, if they so wish, on favourable terms, which is fair and reasonable. By agreement with the professions, the scheme will operate only for a two-year period. The contractors who relinquish a contract in year one of the scheme will receive a payment equivalent to their NHS remuneration in the immediately preceding financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contractors who give up their contract in year two will receive a payment equivalent to half their NHS remuneration in the immediately preceding financial year. The details of the incentive payments scheme have been discussed in detail with the pharmacists' representatives and agreed as part of the new contract package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the scheme is temporary, we believe that there is no reason to add such details to the Bill nor to reopen the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is sensible. Although there are sensitivities, I believe that the balance has been struck in careful negotiations with the profession. The cost of the scheme will be borne equally by the Exchequer and the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am always the first to acknowledge, our amendments in their wording or in their possible effect may not be what we are striving for. I am not sure that the Minister has given the reassurance that we sought—that a blunderbus effect would not be caused by the proposition. We do not doubt the Minister's motives, the motives of those who negotiated with the profession, nor, indeed, those of the profession itself. But, after all, the basic consideration for the profession when it is negotiating about money is to ensure that it obtains all the money possible from the system. No one would criticise the profession for doing so. Nevertheless, satisfying the profession need not be the same as satisfying the old lady who has relied upon a little chemist's shop round the corner that might be induced to cease business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many who might be providing a useful service, especially older people, might think that a nice lump sum that did not involve a year's work was very attractive. I recall when my area used to be served by a newsagents which delivered newspapers. When I was leader of Camden council we closed down a building because it was unsafe and uninhabitable, and the small nawsagent, housed at the bottom of the building, disappeared. Although we offered the proprietor alternative accommodation across the road, he was entitled to take his money and go. As he was about 56, he made a wise and sensible decision, from his point of view. But it was a total disaster for those who had relied on his shop to deliver newspapers every day. Newspapers have not been delivered since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
Some proprietors, who are probably getting on a bit and are getting sick of lumbering around in the shop all day, would like to retire early with a lump sum. However, that would mean the disappearance of a useful and important service in the neighbourhood. I am still not convinced that the ministerial position covers those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I offer one more point? The hon. Gentleman makes a fair argument and we recognise the interests of the contractors. Where there is an excess of NHS contractors and the available resources are under-used and the extra pharmacy in question holds an NHS contract, the NHS must take that contractor's costs into account in calculating the costs of the service. Wider considerations must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed scheme, those who expect to dispense fewer than 16,000 items in the NHS financial year, 1985–86 will be eligible as contractors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 4, line 23, after "appeal", insert—
	<br><q><p>"to a committee of such persons as should be appointed by the Secretary of State ".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

No. 35, in page 5, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>" on the ground of manifest unreasonableness at the time of the relevant decision and on no other ground ".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much unease within the profession about whether appeals will be organised locally or nationally. My sympathies he with an impartial national system of appeals. However, I recognise that that could create a large bureaucracy, staffed by 20 or 30 people and occupying two or three floors of a multi-storey building in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could we introduce an independent national appeals system that necessitates only three or four extra staff? I believe tha such a system would be preferable, if the applicant is turned down by an FPC sub-committee, the regulations say that the appeal would be considered by an appeal committee, which would be comprised of members from more than one neighbouring pharmacy sub-committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Circular HCFD 85.15, states on page 5, paragraph 33, that:
	<br><q><p>" If in the opinion of the chairman of the Appeal Panel (to whom the appeal will initially be referred) or subsequently of the Appeal Panel itself the notice of appeal discloses no reasonable grounds of appeal or its vexatious or frivolous (e.g. the grounds consist of unsubstantiated allegations against the persons who considered the application) the appeal can be rejected forthwith."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
Paragraph 34—it is important to put this on record —continues:
	<br><q><p>" The appeal system exists to ensure that obviously wrong or perverse decisions are changed; it does not exist to overturn without good cause local judgement on the necessity and desirability of any proposed changes in NHS pharmaceutical services. Minor errors in PPSC procedure on the arrival of new information are not decisive; a PPSC's decision should be altered only if the Appeal Panel is satisfied that the errors or the new information are of such magnitude that the original decision cannot be sustained."</p></q>
There we have the nub of the argument. The right to appeal should not be limited only to cases where clearly a wrong decision has been made by the original pharmacist sub-committee—it should be given to everyone. There should be a national body to which an appeal could be sent if it did not clearly and unequivocably show that it was not vexatious, capricious and so on, was not based on some narrow principle of law, was not an appeal or interpretation of the regulations, and was not an appeal based, perhaps, (on an interpretation of the original decision. Therefore, if it were not clearly shown that the original decision was completely unreasonable, the appeal could be dismissed immediately. There would be no need for any hearings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations talk about local appeal committes perhaps having oral hearings and moving from place to place. There would be no need for that. The papers could be put on someone's desk, looked at to find out if there were an apriori case for the appeal, and a decision could then be made about whether there was something clearly and obviously wrong with the original decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not want that responsibility in the hands of one person because that is dangerous. Indeed, the first sentence of paragraph 33 allows that. It says:
	<br><q><p>" If in the opinion of the chairman of the Appeal Panel (to whom the appeal will initially be referred) or subsequently of the Appeal Panel itself the notice of appeal discloses no reasonable grounds … the appeal can be rejected forthwith."</p></q>
Even if the Minister gives no undertaking to think about this again, and insists on local appeals. I think it is wrong to allow an appeal to be " rejected forthwith " by the chairman. Therefore, I hope that the regulations will be re-written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will also apply if a national appeal body is introduced, which is what the amendment seeks to achieve. There ought to be one, two or three people to whom the appeals could be sent and when the chairman is minded to dismiss an appeal because it does not come within the tight terms of reference drawn for the appeal committee, he should pass it to his colleagues and say that unless he hears from them within a week the appeal will be dismissed. I am sure that could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That measure is important not only because Opposition Members tabled the amendment, but because it is one wanted by the industry. It is wanted by the small pharmacists and also by the large retailing pharmacists. I believe that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have received letters from
Underwoods, the British Retailers Association
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
and from the PPSC on behalf of small pharmacists, which desperately want a national committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that is that there is likely to be a " You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours " attitude if such matters are left to the local committee. That is the problem. If appeals are undertaken by committees from surrounding areas, the committee members will know -that one day there will be an appeal for an application in their area and members from the original committee will sit in judgment on their decision. That will be difficult, and with the best will in the world people are only human and may not take an independent and objective view about whether an original decision was one that no reasonable committee could conceivably have reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not arguing for a massive new bureaucracy, but a small unit that will sift those appeals. If the regulations were seen to be drawn tightly, applicants would know that when a decision had been taken there would be little point in appealing as it would need to be based on stringent criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal committee should be as independent as possible. At present, it consists of three lay members, three pharmacists and an independent chairman. It would be useful if at least one of those pharmacists did not have an NHS contract. He should have no financial involvement in a large undertaking and should not practice in the area for which he sits on the committee. That would improve the appeal committee. The system will work only if the public knows that the committee will do its job dispassionately, independently and without having different vested interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a committee which decides who should be able to open a pharmacy should consist of lay members only. Pharmacists should only advise. However, it is normal practice to have a 50:50 make-up in such committees, with an independent chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must show the public that the committee's decisions are absolutely above board and that there are no vested interests. If it is thought that there are vested interests, people will appeal and there will be much more of an outcry when those are turned down. If appeals are allowed only on a strict ground, the original decision must be seen to be above board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing an important matter. Our amendment may be defective and may not meet the case completely, but the appeals procedure will be detailed in regulations. However, a helpful reply from the Minister would be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A national appeal system would lead to consistent decisions and equity would be seen to exist among contractors. On the other hand, a local appeal system would be advantageous as there would be local knowledge, but there could also be local interest. It is suggested that the panel should be drawn from the same NHS region. How far from the FPC should that panel be drawn? Would it be so far away that it would still have a local knowledge but not a local interest?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) implied that these days there are chains of chemists throughout the country, so it is almost inevitable that if a shop appeals against a decision, one of its people will be involved in the appeal process, even if it is same distance from where the original request was made. There is a dilemma over getting it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the thinking of hon. Members who would like some type of national system, but I am not sure that the amendment's proposal that the Secretary of State appoint a panel is the right answer. I hope that my right hon. Friend will give the matter further thought—I suspect that he will not accept the amendment—to see whether there can be consultation with the appropriate bodies to work out a compromise appeal mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it unlikely that there will be many appeals, because once the criteria are clearly laid down, it must be evident in each case whether people should apply or should not apply. It would be evident to applicants what their chances would be if they appealed. They would need fairly strong grounds for suggesting that the committee has not made its decision in accordance with the criteria laid down. But we know that the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee, both of which are genuinely in favour of the package in the Bill, are unhappy about the local appeals system. That being so, 1 hope that my right hon. Friend will look at this again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the services committee accepted the proposal in the original negotiations but it was, after all, part of a package, and to some extent a take-it-or-leave-it position, so it is understandable that the committee has reservations. Without endorsing the amendment, perhaps my right hon. Friend can discuss the matter with the appropriate bodies between now and the issuing of regulations and possibly come up with a compromise that meets my reservations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment strongly, because it touches a point of critical importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 and the amendment, which will attract a great deal of debate, relates to the freedom to provide pharmaceutical services, if a person so wishes, and to the related issue of an independent right of appeal against refusal to admit a would-be practitioner to a neighbourhood list. I have serious concern about these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reading clause 2 for the first time, I decided that the Government owe us a philosophical ex planation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not debate too much of clause stand part now. If he does so, and we discuss the other amendments in relation to clause, I shall move clause stand part formally at the end of the discussion. It is a matter of choice for the hon. Gentleman. If he goes too far into clause stand part and away
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
from the amendment, he will jeopardise a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very fair warning, Sir Philip, which I shall heed. I merely wish to state briefly the general principles and relate the amendment to them. If I stray too far, which I shall take care not to do, I shall forgo my right to speak on clause stand part, because I do not wish to take up the Committee's time unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is about more regulation rather than more competition, and the Government are taking the opposite direction from their other areas of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is about more regulation as opposed to more competition. The Government are doing quite the opposite from what they are doing in other policy areas. The clause is about the right of someone wishing to set up as an independent practitioner of pharmaceutical services and the regulations surrounding that. I learnt from both the debate and the valuable speech by the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). The hon. Gentleman pointed out on Second Reading that free enterprise does not apply at present and that in starting up as a practitioner, an independent contractor incurs an on-cost for the Government. Therefore, strictly speaking, it is not fair to argue that this is entirely a matter of free enterprise; rather, it is one of subsidised entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point strongly that, unless the amendment is accepted, the clause puts all the cards in the hands of established chemists in existing businesses as opposed to the challengers who want to enter the market, and that is not right. Someone who wants to break into the local scene and provide these services may be a better practitioner than some of the established local practitioners. Unless we provide stringent national safeguards we shall be threatened with having locally-established pharmaceutical cartels, and that is not right. The challenger may have new ideas, but however good they are, he may have little likelihood of a breakthrough in the established local conditions, especially if they are buttressed by a system of local appeal. In principle, the clause as drafted is not fair and should be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the rights of appeal, and if there are no rights as to freedom of entry the system of appeal is critically important because that system must adjudicate on who can and cannot provide the service. Therefore, the system of appeal must be watertight, impartial, and purer than Caesar's wife. But at present it is not, because the scene is set for local jobbery in certain circumstances, and I shall expand that argument shortly, in aid of which I shall later describe a case to do with rights of appeal in pharmaceutical services, which came to my notice in connection with my duties as a member of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As freedom as we knew it has gone, rights of appeal must be provided which are scrupulously
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
independent and free of any local establishment influence. I suggest that the clause does not provide such rights of appeal. The present proposal is that the neighbourhood local pharmaceutical committee should be involved, but that is not good enough. I do not think that the local and even the neighbourhood situation will be free from local influence. Those who are doing well will want to keep the status quo and stand pat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenger—someone new who wishes to establish premises—could be a potential better purveyor of services than the established one. As that cannot be proved by the market place, there must be a critical form of regulation. Will national standards of service be laid down, so that a mediocre established chemist can be shifted and an enthusiastic newcomer given a chance to prove his enterprise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government are introducing regulations, will they push matters a little further to encourage new blood?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister explained why the Government were not setting up a national appeals procedure. He referred to:
	<br><q><p>" all the bureaucracy that that would entail."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 15 April 1986; Vol. 95, c. 799.]</p></q>
That is an awful admission for a politician. The Minister said that we could not have an appeals procedure because it would entail too much bureaucracy. It is absolutely deplorable to suggest that we could not set up a simple appeals mechanism without cluttering it up with bureaucracy. The Minister gave not a reason but an excuse. Will he come clean with the Committee now? It is not necessary to have a clutter of bureaucracy in an appeals procedure, so the Minister should think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeals procedure envisaged in clause 2 should coincide with local needs. I remind the Minister that we are discussing the needs of local consumers, not the jobbers who provide the services. I define " local needs " as fresh blood being introduced with scrupulously fair rights of appeal to ensure that no one is shut out in favour of established chemists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to local bureaucracy and shall quote paragraphs 38 and 39 from the first report of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, session 1984–85, which was published on 2 October 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set the scene. We were examining a family practitioner committee about pharmaceutical services in connection with an abuse. I am certain of my facts, because I did most of the questioning. The Health Service ombudsman does not consider family practitioner matters very often. He is more concerned with hospital services. But when this matter was considered, we found that something was not quite right in the state of Denmark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There had been a dispute about the hours in which pharmaceutical services were to be provided. A Jewish chemist wanted the hours altered to conform with his religious practices. There was much toing and froing. Perhaps I can sum it up better
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
be saying that it was jobbery. There was no doubt about that. The Health Services Commissioner found that the family practitioner committee, particularly the sub-committee which is responsible for the provision of pharmaceutical services, had been responsible for maladministration over the opening hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fountain of all wisdom in this matter was Sir Kenneth Stowe, the permanent Secretary in the Department. The Select Committee said in paragraph 39 that:
	<br><q><p>" We were astonished that the Family Practitioner Committee could have behaved so unfairly and furthermore could have been reluctant to agree to Sir Cecil Clothier's recommendations. We are pleased that eventually they did consent to rescind their decision, but the manner in which the witnesses from the Committee gave evidence left us unhappy "—</p></q>
That is the understatement of the year—
	<br><q><p>" We were very surprised that the Secretary to the Local Pharmaceutical Committee, who was the source of the allegations against the complainant and who seemed to be a motive force behind his unfair treatment, was to be the next Chairman of the Family Practitioner Committee. The behaviour of those involved in this case highlighted the need for some provision of a right of appeal. In his evidence to us, Sir Kenneth Stowe indicated that the DHSS was committed to legislation to put this into effect. We hope that a right of appeal is created in the near future."</p></q>
Let me now press the button, having built up that platform. The leading civil servant in the DHSS is now thinking hard about a naional system of appeal on chemists hours. We are talking about the right of entry into the whole trade. If the Department is already thinking about a national appeals system on such a minor matter, compared with what we are discussing, the Minister has lost his case without firing a short. The Department is already alking about a system of appeals. There is nothing about erecting a bureaucracy or what would happen if it were cluttered up with civil servants. Sir Kenneth Stowe said that it has been on the stocks for a long time. Therefore, the Minister's bland reply is not good enough because the case has been conceded in another context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote one more short paragraph just to put the remaining nails in the coffin. The Select Committee report states:
	<br><q><p>" Sir Kenneth Stowe reported last year the Department's commitment"—</p></q>
I underline the word " commitment"—
	<br><q><p>" to considering legislative action with a view to providing a right of appeal to individual pharmacists to the Secretary of State "—</p></q>
in other words, there will be an appeal right to the top of the triangle—
	<br><q><p>" against decisions of family practitioner committees in hours of service matters. Sir Kenneth wrote to me on 23 October last year to say that they had intended to include in amending regulations, facilitating the introduction of a pharmacists's new contract, an appeals mechanism for individual contractors on hours of service matters."</p></q>
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the case for a national appeal has been conceded. It is being thought about in the Department in connection with pharmaceutical hours. If a national appeals system is being considered on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
such relatively minor matters, our amendment cannot be seen as a step forward, especially as it relates to the critical aspect of a national appeals procedure—the entry of newcomers to the provision of pharmaceutical services. I shall not even ask the Minister to think again because the thinking is already taking place in his Department, as I understand it, but no doubt the Minister will reveal all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As professional standards have been mentioned by Opposition Members, let me deal with that issue first. The standards of existing pharmacies are not involved in the matters now under discussion. They are the responsibility of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, which has a responsibility for standards in much the same way, I suppose—I speak without advice—as the General Medical Council has responsibility for general medical personnel. Therefore, this debate is not about whether one of the family practitioner committees would be the responsible body for dealing with a pharmacy that was infringing appropriate professional standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several important matters have been raised in the debate. I recognise that although the profession has supported the package of which the arrangements for appeal form an essential part, it has expressed its preference, during the negotiations and since, for a different appeals system. Whether what is being sought is as a result of the parliamentary proceedings—or renegotiation in public of part of that which was done to formulate the package—I leave others to judge. Of course, if that is what is intended it might lead to wider considerations. The lion. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) fairly acknowledged that the arrangements for appeal form part of a package, and he made it clear that, as he understood it, the profession's negotiators had accepted the package as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that all hon. Members, and all those outside Parliament who take an interest in these matters, will be seeking an appeals system that is objective and fair to all involved. That is what it is all about. As drafted, the Bill merely provides for an appeals system without specifying the detailed procedures, which will be spelt out in regulations and in a guidance document which will be issued to family practitioner committees. I thought it courteous and proper to circulate to Committee Members the existing draft guidance document which outlines the Government's thinking and which was prepared last year. Indeed, the hon. Member for Wrexham and others have referred to it during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the appeals process is referred to as a local system, it is more accurately described as a regional system which is sensitive to local conditions, but independent of the FPC concerned. It carries with it several supporting arguments as to its appropriateness. It is consistent with the functions of the FPCs. The committees must consider whether it is necessary or desriable in the interests of local needs for the contract to be awarded. That is a fundamental requirement. The decision is not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
considered in the interests of the profession generally, nor a chain of stores and so on. I hope that that commands the widespread support of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain shortly how the cartel and the undue influence from those involved in chains are dealt with. Important safeguards have been built into the provisions to cover that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to whether such a regionally-based system that includes knowledge and sensitivity to local conditions can work more quickly, and with less bureaucracy, than a central system which might imply that hearings would be held in London. Alternatively, civil servants might need to consider an area about which they know nothing. They could become involved in problems about the rigid distance limit, such as the matter of 1 or 2 kms which the Committee discussed at our previous sitting. Local people will understand that sometimes a 1 km distance is formidable, which would not be so readily known to people from my Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, prima facie, there is an argument to say that a regionally-based system, 'which involves local interest and decision element, can operate more quickly, perhaps, than a centralised one. If it were an issue about hours which apply nationally or a matter which ranged over the profession that was being determined, than a national appeals system would be appropriate. But when it is a matter of trying to judge the individual circumstances of an application, there is advantage in a regionally-based system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the safeguards against the matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chisle-hurst (Mr. Sims) about whether those involved in pharmacy chains could be involved in the determination of an appeal by another party to such a chain. Under the regulations, all members of FPCs are obliged to declare an interest. Therefore, that requirement to declare an interest would resolve that matter. As for the problem of the appeals body establishing a cartel of local pharmacists, the composition of the panel means that pharmacy members are always in a minority. The panel comprises an independent chairman, three pharmacy members and three non-pharmacy members. The quorum rules are designed to maintain that position. If one member is missing from either the pharmacy or non-pharmacy side, the committee will not have a quorum. There must either be three pharmacy and three lay members or two of each, in addition to the independent chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that, even with the balance of the committee as it is. I can envisage an applicant appealing unsuccessfully through the local level structure described by the Minister and then pursuing the matter with his Member of Parliament by claiming that the committee was loaded against him. The niceties of the composition of the committee will not remove the essential worry that current operators in the locality will have the right to ensure that others are prevented from entering their commercial territory. Is the Minister satisfied that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
that problem can be overcome? Chemists in my area are worried that it will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we try to overcome that problem. I have been a Member of Parliament long enough to know that constituents approach us about matters whether their cases are strong or weak. It is proper that our parliamentary system allows them to do so and I am not criticising it. Matters which initially appear to have no merit or justice sometimes turn out to have both after investigation. Indeed, the law has sometimes been changed as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman's argument about what could happen, whatever appeal system is set up. Even if the decision were taken by the archangel Gabriel, I can envisage constituents— perhaps, not mine—wishing to appeal against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, people are anxious about the matter. Locally dominated or local pharmacy-interest dominated committees must be avoided. The system of appeal must be fair and objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 26 would not have the desired effect. I shall follow the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst to consider what has been said today. Further consultations and discussions will be taking place between my officials and pharmacists' representatives and we shall take account of all that was said on Second Reading and in our Committee debates, so that we can establish a fair and objective appeals system and meet the needs of local people. That is the aim of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's undertaking we shall not press the amendment. We recognise that the issue is the subject of negotiations with representatives of the pharmacists, but we have a right to poke our noses into the matter as we represent consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, the Department already has a hand in all sorts of appeals from people providing primary care services. If a family practitioner committee decides that a doctor should be suspended, there is a procedure for appealing to the Secretary of State. Similarly, if someone applies to take over a general medical practice and is turned down at local level, an appeal can be made to the Secretary of State. Such appeals involve judgments about the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of an appeals machinery in this matter would lead only to a minor increase in the workload of those presently operating the national appeals machinery for matters arising from decisions of family practitioner committees. We hope that the Minister will not see it as an insuperable problem. While there is a touch of a second bite of the cherry approach by the profession, it would be wise to consider allowing an appeals machinery as the matter must be seen to be fair, square and above board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply which is as much as we can expect at the Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
mittee stage as we recognised that our amendment is not the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft circular refers to hearings and visits, but I am not sure that a perfunctory visit one morning to a town will help the committee. It will need to consider all sorts of matters, such as where people live, how they go to work, what their work patterns are, where the shops are, bus services, and so on. That is a large undertaking which a committee will be unable to appreciate by visiting a neighbourhood. I believe that many of the appeals could be decided after considering written evidence, which would simplify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is worried about the need for an independent appeal committee, so we should bend over backwards to allay its fears. As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said, however, we shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amedment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 5, line 43, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>" 	<i>(f)</i> that persons having received sums in respect of ceasing to provide drugs, medicines or appliances within the previous five years in the area covered by a list shall not thereafter be considered for inclusion on that list.".</p></q>
The amendment is related to amendments Nos. 25 and 34. It provides that if someone had received severance pay and been severed, so to speak, he would not be able to come back on the payroll immediately afterwards and start drawing money again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rightly announced their intention to get rid of what is known as 24-hour retirement by general practitioners whereby they give up practising for 24 hours and start again, thereby receiving all sorts of lump sums and pension entitlements as well as their pay, which is a ridiculous arrangement. For obvious reasons, we do not believe that anyone who takes the accelerated disappearance money for a local pharmacy should be allowed to come back into the business within the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the amendment is entirely superfluous and that the matter has been considered by the masters of intelligent anticipation in his Department. In that case, we shall be reassured, but we shall not be satisfied until either our amendment is accepted or a similar Government amendment is produced on Report or in the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the manner in which the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) moved the amendment. As he said, it follows on from amendments Nos. 25 and 34, but it also raises a point of real substance in that if the scheme were operated in such a way as to lead to the abuse mentioned both on Second Reading and today so that the contractor could obtain payment for relinquishing the contract and then start up again in a slightly different hat or a slightly different situation, such a possibility would not be generally acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
As we are making such constructive progress, I shall again respond constructively by saying that I should like to look at the matter again to see whether it could more properly be covered by regulation. Following the discussions, inquiries and advice that I have already had, I suspect that it is a difficult matter to handle with absolute certainty, but I think that we shall be able to make some advance on the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as a result of further discussions, it appears that primary legislation is required, I take the honourable Gentleman's point that it might be appropriate to introduce an amendment on Report or in another place. Certainly, I am prepared to look at the matter again because I share his view that the scheme is not for the benefit of someone who can get out of his existing arrangements, receive payment for doing so, and then immediately or soon afterwards start up again in a way that would be wholly out of sympathy with the general proposals that we are considering and which form' the basis of the package negotiated between the Department and the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's helpful response to our proposition. It occurs to me that our amendment may be too harshly drawn. I can imagine—not in my own area but perhaps in the constituency of the honourable Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), who has popped out for a minute—that someone might take the money in one area where he was superfluous and spend it in setting up a pharmacy at the other end of the constituency, where there was no pharmacy. In that case, it might be a useful form of public inducement to provide such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's helpful response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After debating the amendments, it may be as well to consider whether clause 2 is a good clause which should stand part of the Bill. The amendments have dealt with a number of matters, and the Government have seen the sense of some of them. I thank the Minister for listening carefully and saying that he will think about our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the Committee's attention the problems of expanding the services provided by pharmacists, who want to provide an expanding service. The clause is drawn very generally and many of the points will be included in regulations but a pharmacists' charter has been produced—I think that the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee produced it two years ago—and a number of its recommendations would provide extremely useful services to the public if they were provided by pharmacists. I shall go through the summary of recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first recommendation, on the provision of information and advice, states:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<br><q><p>" The advisory role of the Community Pharmacist should be developed, and could result in a significant saving in medical consultation time and drug costs."</p></q>
Perhaps in the regulations the Minister could explore that recommendation to see whether there is a job here for pharmacists to undertake as part of the new contract, which I believe to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition put forward an amendment dealing with counselling, which is the second item of the summary of recommendations in the pharmacists' charter. The charter states:
	<br><q><p>" Where appropriate, provision should be made within community pharmacies for counselling areas incorporating health education materials."</p></q>
That is an extremely important point. The Government successfully resisted our amendment but I am sure that they did not resist the idea that preventive care is far better than having to cure people after they have become ill. Counselling is important. I think that all Opposition Members believe that, and I know that some Conservative Members agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third item—availability of pharmacies— reads:
	<br><q><p>" There should be a proper distribution of community pharmacies in order to best serve the public need, where-ever that need may arise and covering all areas of the community."</p></q>
This is the central issue in the clause and the new contract—that there will be a restriction on the number of pharmacies in certain areas, that there will be an appeals committee, and that the availability of pharmacies will be regulated. We welcome this, because many areas in the United Kingdom have not sufficient pharmacies, not only in rural areas but on council estates where it would be very convenient to have pharmacies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, pharmacists tend to be next door to a doctor's premises or in the centre of town. Indeed, in London there are many examples of half a dozen pharmacies being within a couple of hundred yards of each other. They are there not because they want to dispense prescriptions but because they have a NHS contract which provides them with money even though they do not dispense many prescriptions and allows them to sell other products not necessarily connected with the NHS. That arrangement, of course, is one which the clause and the regulations will seek to avoid, and we welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth item in the summary of recommendations relates to domiciliary services. It states:
	<br><q><p>" The current level of domiciliary services provided by pharmicists should be extended as an essential services to the elderly, mentally ill and physically disabled, and in those areas where a pharmacy is not located."</p></q>
Again, that was the subject of an amendment which the Government successfully resisted. There should be no difference between us on such a matter. Anyone who is elderly, mentally ill or physically disabled should be provided with that service. For example, pharmacists could make up and deliver prescriptions. They may require extra funding to cover the costs of that extra service, but I am sure that they regard themselves as professionals and take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
a pride in providing the best possible service. If that services does not cost any more money, there is no need for the profession to demand more money from the National Health Service. If they have to provide counselling rooms or health education materials, the Government should provide the money, but it should not cost much to deliver items to people's homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charter also refers to drug security. That has caused the biggest difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition. The summary says:
	<br><q><p>" The very highest standards of drug security should be available in pharmacies to counteract the increase in break-ins ".</p></q>
I have not received figures showing the increase in break-ins, but I take the pharmacists' word for it. It is too easy for people to break into pharmacies and I regret that the Government did not take that point on board and suggest a suitable amendment. Drugs held by pharmacists should be secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that the summary recommends that
	<br><q><p>" More pharmacists should be made available to the public in order to meet public demand for specialist advice and attention."</p></q>
The number of people per pharmacy is much higher in the United Kingdom that in other European countries. If pharmacists are to provide a more comprehensive service, we have the skilled manpower which should be used to increase that service. A pharmacist has now become someone who merely puts pills into bottles and as long as he can add up to 25 or 30, that is fine. But a pharmacist is a skilled person. He undertakes a three years' course and his skills should be used more for counselling and providing other services. An increase in the number of pharmacists will be needed over the next decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charter says:
	<br><q><p>" Legislation is required to allow pharmacists to provide emergency supplies of drugs under the National Health Service as currently allowed within the private sector."</p></q>
That should not be a cause of contention between the Government and the Opposition. I do not think that the regulations will cover such changes. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next item covered by the summary is a pharmacists' national formulary. The summary recommends:
	<br><q><p>" A pharmacists' National Formulary should be established so that the pharmacists can, where appropriate, supply the public with emergency supplies of certain drugs under the NHS for the symptomatic treatment of common ailments."</p></q>
That is one way in which pharmacists can branch out and provide a better service. Obviously pharmacists will have to consult the BMA to see whether the provision of emergency supplies by pharmacists will be acceptable generally within the health care profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charter recommends:
	<br><q><p>"A full 24-hour pharmaceutical service should be made available to the public."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
Obviously a doctor has certain drugs that he can supply in the middle of the night, if necessary, but every major town should provide a 24-hour pharmaceutical service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the charter says:
	<br><q><p>" Patients should be able to obtain repeat prescriptions direct from pharmacies, thus saving the time of both doctor and patient."</p></q>
While pharmacists should not give repeat prescriptions for certain ailments, they could provide them for common ailments. For example, people who suffer from hay fever every year should be able to ask the pharmacist for the same drug or ask whether an improved drug has been introduced on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome clause 2 as it allows discussions between the different parts of the profession to bear fruit. I am glad that the Minister will reconsider the appeals procedure as we want to satisfy the profession. Often, two parts of a profession are at each other's throats over some issues, but in this instance both sides of the profession—the big retailers and the small pharmacists—are as one in requiring an independent appeals procedure. I hope that the Minister will consult the professions as quickly as possible to find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister say whether it is possible for a pharmacist to apply for an NHS listing without accepting the front loading? As I understand it, front loading is being decreased under the new contract, but a pharmacist may wish to open a second outlet in a town. He may wish to provide a full domiciliary service and deliver prescriptions to people's homes. He may not wish to make up 'he prescriptions in the second outlet, but he may want people to be able to visit those second premises to ask for a prescription to be made up and delivered to their home. Under present rules that would have to be a separate NHS contract with money provided by the NHS, first at the front end and then for prescriptions. Would it come under the pharmaceutical sub-committee of the Family Practitioner Committee if the applicant did not want the front-loading money, but simply to be able to say, " Prescriptions dispensed and delivered", and to have money from the National Health Service only for prescriptions as though he had only one retail premises in the town? Has such a system occurred to Ministers? If it has, I should be interested to hear their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would also say something about rural dispensing committees. I have read the draft circular, which was not circulated. Am I right in thinking that rural dispensing committees will be entirely separate in their agreements and deliberations on prescribing by general practitioners, that any applicant who satisfies the pharmaceutical sub-committee of the FPC will still have to apply to the rural dispensing committee, and that the committee will not be influenced or leant upon by any other committee? The relationship needs to be spelt out and I should be grateful if the Minister would do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

On the essential small pharmacies payments scheme, the Minister gave assurances about the two-kilometre rule and we are grateful for them. There are places in the country where to disallow an application for a pharmacy because it would be nearer tha two kilometres in a straight line from another pharmacy in a prescribed area would be inappropriate. I gave the example of Welsh valleys which run parallel, where the straight line distance between points in two valleys is perhaps; one and a half kilometres but to go from one to the other one would have to fly or go by a round-about route of 20 miles or so. I have no doubt that the same applies in Scotland, with its lochs without bridges—unless a person has a boat or can swim he has to go the long way round to get from one point to die other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assured us that mere would be freedom to consider individual situations when a pharmaceutical sub-committee considered an application in such a prescribed area. However, the draft circular states:
	<br><q><p>"A revised scheme of payments for Essential Small Pharmacies will come into force on 1 October. A pharmacy contractor will be eligible to receive payments under the ESPS scheme if and for as long as the following conditions are satisfied: —</p></q>
	<br><q><p>that the pharmacy dispenses fewer than, 16,000 items annually, and is not less than 2 km. (1·24 miles) in a straight line from the next nearest pharmacy, and, if it dispenses fewer than 16,000 items annually the contracting FPC has stated in writing that the pharmacy in question is essential to the provision of proper pharmaceutical services. These are the only qualifying criteria and there are no exceptions. Standing instructions will be incorporated in the Drug Traffic."</p></q>
That states straightforwardly that there are no exceptions and that if the distance is less than two kilometres there is no chance of a pharmacy benefiting from the essential small pharmacies payments scheme. I can still conceive of say a large conurbation, in one Welsh valley, and the other valley may be a dead-end valley with no roads leading out of it. There may be an isolated village there which desperately needs a pharmacy, which cannot exist alone but will be there only if it can benefit from the scheme payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is clear. Will the Minister confirm that any such possibility will be taken into account by the relevant committees when they consider applications to enable that hypothetical example, which could be a real one if the Bill goes through containing the same draft circular, to benefit? If not, a small village will lose its pharmacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the clause and wish it well although it needs tidying up between now and Report. I shall be grateful to hear what the Minister has to say about the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the Minister's statement about looking again at the appeals; mechanism is extremely welcome. Perhaps that has been the single main issue about this aspect of clause 2 which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
gave rise to concern. I hope that the Minister's discussions with his officials will bear fruit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is worth saying in that context that, as has already been pointed out, there is now a flood of applications going to FPCs. That reminds me of the " beat the Budget" endowment policies of two years ago. I managed to get one through my accountant only to find that the Government are now negotiating with building societies to try to get those policies back if they were not dated properly. Therefore, it is worth putting down a marker about whether the status of some contracts issued in advance of this legislation reaching the statute book will be absolute. I should also point out that if a large number of applications go through during the period before the Bill is enacted, that should relieve the pressure on any appeals mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally, on me principle of the clause trying to ensure a more rational distribution of pharmacies, everyone has said that that is sensible and should be supported. It has also led to a significant split of opinion within the profession. We have seen the emergence of die BPA. I do not know what its standing is, what strength it has managed to maintain or the level of support that it has obtained, but there is no doubt that some significant figures in the pharmaceutical world have spoken out very strongly indeed and mere have been considerable divisions and some very hard remarks about certain individuals as the debate has raged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, in a sense, is hardly surprising because in such a Bill clearly there will be those who gain and those who lose. Therefore, it is worth putting on record that at one point I think the BPA said that nearly 1,500 small chemist shops would close because of this legislation. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, however, put the figure in me region of 300 closures. Probably, like most things in politics, the truth may turn out to be somewhere between the two. From the political viewpoint that I adopt, that is a reasonable conclusion to draw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either way, it is not an insignificant level of closures. I accept that the so-called incentive payments are available to ease the position but at a time of high unemployment when many of us look to small businesses to generate additional jobs it is worth expressing concern about the closures that will result from his legislation. I hope that the effects will not be so dramatic in their impact as the top end of the predictions suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I must be fair and say that any negotiated deal will favour some people more than others. Thinking about another Bill now going through Parliament, it is similar to trying to reconcile the differences regarding salmon fishing. It is impossible to please everyone. The Government have been faced with that situation and it is commendable mat the legislation as drafted has commanded such strong support within the profession. Nevertheless, it is fair to express concern about the closures that will result and the effect that they will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) spoke about the essential small pharmacies scheme in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
context of various Welsh valleys. I do not know much about the Welsh valleys but I know a bit about the highlands and glens of Scotland. As I understand it, the essential small pharmacies serving mainly rural areas will be no worse off in Scotland but in England and Wales identical pharmacies will receive improved National Health Service payments and a guaranteed minimum income. The view has been expressed to me, and I put it to the Minister for consideration because I do not have the information to hand to make a judgment on this complaint one way or the other, that resulting from the dislocation—if that is the way to put it— between those north of the border and those in England and Wales it will be a slightly lower tier health service in Scotland when the Bill is enacted. I shall be grateful to hear the Minister's comments on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the general principles embodied in the Bill are sound, command all-party support and are welcome because they affect an important aspect of the health service—the local chemist shops. We look forward to hearing on Report that the Minister and his Department have reached agreement with the pharmacists' representative bodies that some form of appeals mechanism can be introduced which will allay the fears expressed and result in a fairer method of deciding the distribution of pharmacies at local level than is the case in the legislation as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say how grateful I am for the general support given to the clause which provides the legislative basis to enable the Government to implement the agreement which was made last year with the pharmaceutical profession but which, alas, had to be postponed because of concern that the appropriate legal provisions were not contained in primary legislation. I am glad that we have reached this stage in carrying through the agreements that had been entered into properly and honourably by my predecessor in his detailed discussions with the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said that he thought that there was a difference between the Opposition and the Government about drug security. The difference arose on the technicalities—whether it was appropriate for reference to it to be made in the legislation—but there was no difference between us about the high importance of appropriate drug security being maintained on both new and existing pharmacies. I hope that the only message to go out from the Committee will be one of unanimity on the importance of maintaining proper security arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More widely, the hon. Member for Wrexham brought out many of the points which arose from the Nuffield Foundation inquiry and which are also covered in the Government's consultation document on primary care. A wide-ranging public discussion is starting about the role and development of pharmacy. Pharmacists are highly skilled, but their role in the profession and the industry has changed. The importance of their high professional skills in making up medicines has been altered because of prepackaging, the fact that pills are produced in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
appropriate dosage, and so on. Technical change has caused the services performed by the pharamcist to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nuffield inquiry points towards the way in which the profession can develop the service that it offers to the public and to patients. I do not wish to pre-empt those discussions. It is clear that discussions will take place with the contractor professions and the Government. But I hope that there will be more wide-ranging discussions on primary care. The Government are seeking changes and developments that will improve the services to the public and to the patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked several detailed questions. I should prefer to reply in writing to his technical question about a branch being opened up in particular circumstance as I suspect that I must get the nuance and detail absolutely right. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman was correct about the rural dispensing committee. The Bill will not affect the functions of the rural dispensing arrangements. Paragraphs 37 and 39 of the draft circular make that clear. As for essential small pharmacies, it is not intended that exceptions would be made to the rules as currently operated, but account will be taken of all the points made on the clause on Second Reading and in Committee in the further consultations with the profession about the regulations and the guidance. I am grateful for the way in which my comments about the appeals machinery have been received by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Scotland, I am unaware that the fears expressed by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) are well founded, but I shall draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister responsible for health in Scotland to what has been said. I am sure that my hon. Friend will write to the hon. Gentleman if there is any change. In view of what I have said, I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment aims at fairness. For too long the Government have operated a system in which from opticians in particular, but from general practitioners, dentists and pharmacists as well, they try to recover gross overpayments well after the event. Rightly, the opticians took the Government to court and won.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to give the Government power to do anything they like. The clause is wide ranging. Later amendments seek further to restrict the Government's powers, but this amendment seeks simply to ensure that if the Government have made overpayments they should not try to make blanket recovery of the money regardless of what has happened to the service in the meantime. For example, an optician might have obtained discounts for grinding lenses which the Government did not take adequately into account. It would be wrong for the Government to levy an extra charge on every optician two or three years later, solely for administrative convenience, although they should have the powers to recover overpayments. I refer to' the system whereby the costs and remuneration paid to the professions and agreed between the professions and the Government are not abrogated. New information should not enable that to happen a year or two later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money should be recovered from those who benefited from the overpayment. If the overpayments are recovered two or three years later, some opticians will have retired and new entrance will be practising. The Government are likely to say that it is technically impossible to' do anything because there are insufficient clerical staff to discover who has benefited from the overpayments and so' on. Such arguments are not worth the paper on which they are written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ought to have decided to start from scratch with a new system from the day on which the Bill is enacted. They should have decided to let bygones be bygones. If they are to try to recover overpayments, they should show justice and fairness. On Second Reading the Minister said that the Government would not try to recover money from eye test fees where opticians had been overpaid for the grinding of lenses. I might not have that quite correct. I forget precisely what the Minister said on Second Reading but it went some way towards allaying the worries of many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
We are discussing a principle of fairness. If someone is overpaid, it is no good saying to' him in two years' time, " We want the money back. We are the Government and can pass laws to levy a flat rate on the profession." That is neither fair, just nor moral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 seeks to put that right by substituting the words
	<br><q><p>" from the remuneration of those persons who provided the description or category of services falling within such description and to no other persons, an amount to take account of any overpayment made to those persons."</p></q>
The computing facilities in the DHSS should be capable of handling that. Those payments should be logged to individual retailers. If not, the Government should not chase that goose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is sensible, honest and would lead to less cynicism about the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the objective of the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) that we should continue to strive for fairness in our contracting and payment arrangements. It is important to understand that the arrangements have worked well for many years and it is not our intention to change the current system for doctors, dentists and the other professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing public money and it is important to pursue overpayments. The hon. Member for Wrexham said that the clause gives the Government power to do anything they like. That is unjustified. Discretion is necessary, and it is accepted by the professions involved that such discretion has worked well. There is an element of balancing in such arrangements and different factors apply for the various professions, so flexibility is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This all sounds very reasonable and the Minister is a reasonable man, However, it is misleading to suggest that all is sweetness and light. The clause exists because the Government were taken to the cleaners last October when they tried to act in exactly the heavy-handed and unfair way to which the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred. It was both regressive and retrospective. The Minister suggests that the Government are all good men and true who make good judicial judgments, but the opticians' profession took the Government to the High Court and won.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here to enact a provision that is generally accepted as fair and reasonable. I hope that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) is not suggesting that as guardians of the public purse, we do not ensure that the large amounts of money given to the National Health Service are properly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance has to be struck. The £11 million has been written off and is water under the bridge. We seek to confirm, as far as possible—within the Bill, a system that requires the type of flexibility that we have discussed—to enshrine arrangements that, with that exception, have worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various professions' remuneration systems require balancing arrangements. It is all very well,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
as the hon. Member for Wrexham said, to let bygones be bygones, but, as regards the £11 million, perhaps we can accept that that is where we are. We need to ensure that both overpayments and underpayments can be worked out on a basis acceptable to the professions, so that the final level of remuneration is calculated carefully. It is made up of many different fees, allowances and costs, and any service includes categories of service—to use the legal term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The calculation is not straightforward but the aim of negotiation is to achieve a reasonable overall settlement, taking account of each element within that category of service. I hope that the Committee accepts that this set of provisions is what is needed to achieve the fairness that the hon. Member for Wrexham mentioned, and that the impact of the amendments would be unnecessary or would restrict and limit the arrangement in a manner detrimental to a general proposition that has worked v/ell in the interests of the contracting professions and the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I can do no better than use the words in a recent letter to me from the director general of the Federation of Opthalmic and Dispensing Opticians. The Minister's general tone was one of sweetness and light and fairness and reasonableness, with everyone coming together to see what was in their best interests. He used an extraordinary phrase in answering my earlier intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To judge by the party political broadcast I was unfortunate enough to watch last night, the SDP manifesto is appearing in the Labour party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that hon. Members will not pursue this too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My fairness and reasonableness have been tested and provoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was widespread agreement and that everyone appreciated the wisdom of the provision. That is absolute balloney. The Government, having begun with a Bill to abolish Crown immunity in hospital kitchens, sensibly used the opportunity—as there was heavy pressure from the pharmacists' lobby to get their contract through—to sag on a second clause dealing with a pharmacy contract. But they were hammered yet again—as has regularly happened to the DHSS in the courts since the last election—and have introduced a third clause quite unrelated to the other two but connected with this aspect in clause 3. The Minister therefore gives the wrong impression of the background to these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman in favour of adjustments of remuneration? They are the basis of the clause. The structure of the pay is that there are underpayments and overpayments which need to be adjusted. Does he support that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. But, as the hon. Member for Wrexham said, it has to be fair. The Minister also spoke of fair and sensible arrangements. The Government's motives could hardly be described as in that spirit when the Secretary of State was judged in the Courts to be acting illegally last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, therefore, I question the Government's motives. The rounded happy description that the Minister gave does not seem to reflect thinking in the upper reaches of the DHSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister speaks of the need to be sensible and for the provision to work. What did he say to the director general of the Federation of Ophthalmic and Dispensing Opticians which, in a letter to me dated 23 April stated:
	<br><q><p>" We feel that it is a notable defect of the clause that nowhere does it contain any obligation on the determining authority to provide fair and reasonable remuneration"?</p></q>
That is a fairly telling criticism which the Minister would do well to answer, because that central trust is what his case was based on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond in the words of the director general of the federation who, in a letter dated 18 April, in which he thanked the Government for the clear undertaking given by my right hon. Friend and me that no further attempt had been made to recover the sum in question, stated:
	<br><q><p>"In the light of the undertakings you have now given, I hope that both we and the Department can put all this behind us and resume our normal good working relation ship."</p></q>
The proposed legislation enshrines that good working relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The director general stated in his letter to me that there is a notable defect in the clause. Does not the Minister feel anxious that notable defects in legislation will have a detrimental effect on the good working relationship?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the Government are so far from wearing a hair shirt that they have not even mentioned that they had to change their clothing at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government were doing was so manifestly unfair that it was set aside in the courts, and, as a result of trying to act in a way for which they did not have the power, they have had to write off 11 million quid. If a local authority had done that, the people responsible would, under present law, be liable to find it from their own pockets, but because we have a benificient Parliament which, thank God, has never imposed these obligations on Ministers, that does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the writer of the letter was grateful to the Government for not saying that they would return and attempt to steal again the £11 million to which they had no right. Ministers ought not 1o be too thrilled and exhilarated at receiving a letter of thanks for committing a monstrosity in the first place, and not attempting it a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
So far, because the Minister has not had the power, the Government are not under an obligation to act fairly and reasonably under statute. If we give them powers to do in future what has hitherto been unlawful, it is not unreasonable to require them to behave fairly and reasonably in the exercise of such powers but for the possession of which they would not be able to do what they have tried to do in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have been given substantial powers to claw back money. We consider it fair and reasonable of the Committee to require them to behave fairly and reasonably in the exercise of these new and substantial powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the Government have been just clawing —taking back money from those who never had it in the first place. That was a mess and we welcome the fact that it will be cleared up. Those with whom the Government consulted and negotiated welcome it, too. They want the Government to act fairly and reasonably in the future. That restraint must be placed on future Governments as well as the present one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the clawing back went in both directions. For example, between 1978 and 1982 opticians were paid arrears amounting to £2 million. I hope that he is not challenging the concept of underpayments and overpayments in both directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone would challenge in the court the Government's obligation to pay up for underpayments, although I am not sure how you make an underpayment, Sir Philip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do no such thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally, I do so at every opportunity. Everyone was satisfied with a system in which underpayments were made up, but the draconian and unrestricted use of the power to get back overpayments, including theoretical ones from, people who were not overpaid in the first place, led the profession to take the Government to court and the court rightly found that the Government had no power to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives substantial power to the Government and restraints should be built into the provisions to the benefit of all concerned. I am sure that the officials and far-sighted lawyers who helped to draft the legislation do not want to appear in the High Court again. Unless the concept of fairness and reasonableness is written into the Bill, there may be some mess-up in the original calculations and the professions may find themselves in the court. I suspect that I represent more lawyers than other members of the Committee as Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn are within my constituency, but I have never believed that the country prospers the more people resort to litigation. It is Parliament's obligation to produce legislation that minimises rather than maximises the chances of lawyers making money from litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend realise that one feature of this Parliament is that the Government have been battered round the courts? That applies especially to the Secretary of State for Transport. The Government have been on the wrong end of innumerable decisions. In that sense a provision which seeks to prevent the Government from becoming one of the " old lags " is surely to be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, in our usual generous way —full of freedom and fairness—our desire is to ensure that Ministers do not appear before the courts again. The Government have had a record number of defeats in the courts. That is especially true of the Secretary of State for Transport who, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Brom-wich, East (Mr. Snape) said, now has more form than the Kray brothers. We seek to cut litigation to a minimum. It does no one any good as a way of life, other than its practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the concept of reasonableness and fairness written into the Bill. We are not saying that our amendments would properly achieve the aims of the profession.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 6, line 14, after " authority ", insert
	<br><q><p>" after consultation with and by agreement with the contracting profession.".</p></q>
I move the amendment on behalf of the hon. Member for Chiselhurst (Mr. Sims) who had to leave the Committee early. It is important as it is a continuation of the one that we have just discussed. It seeks to insert the words
	<br><q><p>" after consultation with and by agreement with the contracting profession."</p></q>
The profession is uneasy about what the Government will do if clause 3 is unamended. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said that the Government have shown no reasonableness in their previous actions in settling prices with the contracting professions, There are procedures set out and the professions are apprehensive that the Government may interfere with those and vary them to their own benefit.

Clause 3(2) states:
	<br><q><p>" An earlier determination is to be taken to have been unsatisfactory only if, had it fallen to the authority to make it at the time of the later determination, the authority would have made it on the basis of different information."</p></q>
That is a wide-ranging subsection and means that subsection (1) could be interpreted by the Government in any way. They have a 	<i>carte blanche</i> to say, " The determination that we made with one of the contracting professions is not satisfactory. We now have different information." That different information is not defined; we do not know whether it must be substantial or based on an independent inquiry. It is little wonder that the contracting professions are extremely apprehensive about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will appreciate that something must be done either now or on Report, to ensure that proper procedures will be followed. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Chisle-hurst—if I understand his intentions correctly— seeks at least to preserve the position of the contracting professions by saying that the Government must consult them before embarking on or varying a determination. It is an extremely sensible amendment that should be written into the clause along with others, and I hope that the Government will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, on consultation, I assure the Committee that the Government are already obliged under existing regulations to consult the relevant representative organisations. However, in the wider panorama over which the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) took us, I became increasingly confused about his approach. We are being told constantly of his party's devotion to the National Health Service. Without going too far, I hear that only last night assorted members of Equity told us of that devotion and Mr. David Yip said how safe he felt the NHS to be in the hands of the Labour Party. We have a duty to the contracting professions, but we also have a duty to the NHS, to the taxpayers and to the patients, so for the balance that we are striking to be fair and reasonable it must be fair and reasonable to all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to both this amendment and the other, I remind the Committee that under the general law the Secretary of State is obliged to act reasonably when fixing remuneration as indeed he is when exercising powers of a similar nature in any other sphere. That is the balance that we must strike. The effect of amendment No. 49 in the names of my honourable Friends the Members for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) and for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame J. Knight) would be to give the contracting professions, in effect, a veto over the Government's decisions, which, of course, would not be in the interest of all those whom we seek to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the honourable Member for Wrexham will accept that that is not an objective that the Government share. Consultations are provided for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
already under the relevant regulations, but consultation is not a matter of allowing a total right to veto any decision. Consultation is there, but ultimately a balance must be struck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister's point about the drafting is well taken and accepted, but it does not destroy the force of the argument. The Minister is calmly making a full-bloodied attempt to re-write history. Mr. Justice MacPherson, who had to rule on this matter at the end of last year, spoke about the obscurity of the existing position. It is obscure indeed if the far-sighted lawyers in whom the Minister for Health earlier placed such great faith were at variance with rulings coming from the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as the Minister has said, there is already an obligation to consult under existing arrangements, there must be something defective about them if the outcome of that excellent consultative procedure is that the two groups who are supposed to be consulting each other—the Government and the industry—end up conducting a dialogue across a courtroom. In view of the comments of Mr. Justice MacPherson, I do not think that the Government can argue with much conviction that the existing legislative situation is satisfactory. It is quite the opposite. It is obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the director-general of the Federation of Ophthalmic and Dispensing Opticians is writing a great number of letters at present. I have another one. He says that the profession wants a statutory requirement for consultation. No wonder! It someone had tried to recoup vast amounts of money and the only way that we could see them off was by going to court, we would not be happy to allow a piece of legislation to go through on the nod which would clarify the right of that person to take that action without any legal recourse. On a practical level, consultation is as much in their interests as in the opticians' interests. I cannot see why the Government will not accept a greater measure of statutory consultation built into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Department's thinking on this matter is not clear. After the ruling that went against it in October, we heard that the DHSS were to appeal in the new year. We also heard that the Scottish Home and Health Department did not intend to appeal. England and Scotland have different legal systems—thank goodness. The system is much better north of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to speculate why the DHSS felt that it had room for manoeuvre and appeal whereas the Scottish Home and Health Department did not. That adds to the problem that the Government have got into up to the neck. The law was not clear and it was not clarified by the manner in which the Government acted. They are now introducing legislation that does not clarify the law but simply gives them greater powers. Therefore, it is only reasonable to suggest that the Government should build in a greater measure of consultation. If matters end up in the High Court, obviously the consultative mechanisms have failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of instruments by which consultation is provided for. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) referred in particular to opticians. I am advised that under regulation 10 of the National Health Service (General Ophthalmic Services) Regulations 1974 the Secretary of State must, before fixing remuneration, consult such organisations as he may recognise as representing contractors providing general ophthalmic services. Parallel provisions are laid down in other regulations. Therefore, the regulations provide for consultations and it seems otiose to add anything further to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is symptomatic of the many amendments that we have yet to consider, and which are a result of the wide and sweeping nature of the clause. I understand the Minister's argument about contractors being provided with a veto, but that assumes that contractors will exercise that veto. Progress will be made only when both parties—the Government and the contractors— behave reasonably and reach an agreement. However, we do not know what is meant by re-opening negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Opposition are committed to the National Health Service, we must satisfy opticians,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
dentists and pharmacists if they are to provide a good Health Service. That is an absolute prerequisite. We must therefore ensure that the contracting professions are happy with the terms under which they operate. We must believe they can provide a good service and that their morale is high in providing that service. That is something that the Government always seem to forget in many other areas. Therefore, where possible we want legislation which is generally accepted by those people whom it affects—in this case, the contracting professions.
