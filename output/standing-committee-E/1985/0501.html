	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF FOOD LEGISLATION TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH SERVICE PREMISES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [29 April],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Along with the rest of the Committee, I am impatient to hear the logic of the argument of the honourable Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Norris).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Norris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As if not a moment had passed by, I remind the Committee that I intervened in the speech of the honourable Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) to point out the rather extraordinary assumption that he appeared to be making that no improvement in service efficiency was possible without massive capital investment, and that any measure which did not propose such investment must be as of nought. Is the honourable Gentleman not aware that in the Stanley Royd case, for example, it was the evident failure of standards of practice rather than the absence of capital equipment that so notably contributed to the deplorable position there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the honourable Gentleman. Is he a smoker that he should be so out of breath after coming up a few stairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the result of a mis-spent youth!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is a mis-spent adulthood as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course no one can deny that money must sometimes be laid out to improve working practices, but if a health inspector says that a cooker, for example, is out of date and no longer hygienic, the matter can hardly be rectified by improving the working practice; the cooker must be replaced. The honourable Gentleman may be suggesting that the hospital board should see whether the Salvation Army can provide one that can be installed for nothing, but I do not think that the health inspector would view that as the right way to deal with the problem. I think that he would say, "You will have to spend some money and buy the best modern cooker", which is what one expects in a hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that some improvements in working practices are needed, but so is there a need for
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
capital expenditure. If the honourable Gentleman thinks back to what I said, he will recall that I was objecting to the Government stating in the explanatory and financial memorandum that clause 1
	<br><blockquote><p>"has no implications for public expenditure".</p></blockquote>
I do not see how that can be the case. First, there are financial implications for health boards and health authorities in terms of the money that they will have to spend in improving some of their hospitals' kitchens. Certainly, in Scotland, this is not a matter merely of hospital kitchens and working practice; nurses' homes should be included as well. If three or four nurses' flats are served by one kitchen, which may be only a poky little hole in the wall, presumably money would need to be spent to improve it. In Scotland, the small canteen facilities in health centres would be included, because they are part and parcel of health board property, which I gather they are not in England and Wales. Money will be involved from the health boards' point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money will also be involved from the local authority point of view, and there will be manpower implications. My other objection is that the Bill has no manpower implications. In my own local authority—Glasgow district council—the environmental health department will have to carry out regular inspections of the major hospitals, the teaching hospitals—Glasgow university has a medical school and many of the large hospitals in Glasgow are teaching hospitals for the university— the smaller hospitals, health board accommodation, nurses' homes and health centres. All of them in the area will need to be inspected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government believe that that burden of extra work can be achieved without any extra manpower and that not one extra person will be put on the payroll to carry out that work? I cannot accept that. How can a local authority be expected to carry out that work without taking on extra manpower? Local authorities will have to spend money employing extra people, so the Bill is bound to have financial as well as manpower implications for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill has manpower and financial implications for local authorities as I wish to see food regulations applied to all Health Service institutions. However, if money is not spent on improving kitchens or on extra staff, we are wasting our time. There is no point in our discussing a Bill that will be unenforceable, once enacted. Unfortunately, we tend to spend too much of our time passing laws that cannot be enforced. I hope that the Bill will not fall into that category and that it will be properly applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope also that the Minister will define the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"premises used by a health authority"</p></blockquote>
The clause does not specify premises "owned by" a health authority. For example, the Greater Glasgow health board may wish to rent some council flats from Glasgow district council for the use of doctors or nurses, who will live in them rent free. Will such premises fall within the terms of the clause? Of course, if they were merely privately rented flats,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
they would not be covered by public authority food regulations. However, the clause implies that a food inspector can say to a nurse living in one of those flats, "Sorry, you are not keeping your kitchen tidy enough". Perhaps the Minister could spend a little time explaining the term "used by" a health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider that point in relation to Scotland. Scotland has a unitary system of health control and the health board controls both primary and secondary health care. That does not apply in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to vote against the clause, but I am not happy about the clause as it does not go far enough to ensure that the highest standards of cleanliness will be kept in hospitals once the Bill is enacted. I detect the hands of the Treasury and the Prime Minister in the way in which the Government have approached the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
Not in an NHS hospital!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the precise point. My honourable Friend has hit the nail on the head. Few Conservative Members use NHS hospitals. They prefer not to. Certainly, the Prime Minister does not use NHS hospitals; so why should she spend public money on them? Spend only the minimum amount of public money so that scandals are not revealed on the front pages of newspapers week in and week out. Basically, the Conservative party does not believe in the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> of 2 November 1985 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thatcher stands by NHS legal immunity".</p></blockquote>
There is no question but that Prime Minister was not going to do anything about the dreadful pest infestation and general unhealthiness of NHS premises. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has no immediate plans to change the law to allow prosecution of National Health Service hospitals which break hygiene regulations … Mrs. Thatcher made it clear in a letter to Mr. Ashley"—</p></blockquote>
my right honourable Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the Government was concerned about unhygienic food handling and pest infestation in hospitals.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But she added: 'It would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that abolition of Crown immunity is the only answer. While this is not ruled out as an option, the Government has no immediate plans to lift Crown immunity from the NHS."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the principal ethos which drives the present Administration is that they do not want to spend public money unless absolutely forced to do so by public opinion. Moreover, the Government were forced in this instance. I do not tar every Conservative Member with the same brush, and I am aware that many do not hold the view which I have outlined, but the Government do. When a Conservative Back Bench Member brought forward a Bill that would lift Crown immunity, the Government were spurred into action. The Government asked themselves, "What can we do? Can Crown immunity be lifted so that the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, the Public Health
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Acts and the Food Acts apply to NHS hospitals? Oh dear me, no. That would cost far too much money. We don't want to spend money on the public. We want to keep that money for our supporters." Therefore, the Government proposed a compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 does not do even the barest minimum. It does not do enough. It makes an attempt but it is only a fig leaf to cover NHS legislation. The clause provides that only the Food Acts will apply to the kitchen and food preparation areas of hospitals, and that is not good enough. It is pathetic and abysmal but it is better than nothing. One must be grateful for crumbs from the table of this Government, with their huge majority. It is better to have a crumb than nothing, however, so I shall not vote against the clause. But it is important that the public realise exactly where this measure can be placed among a panoply of measures that the Government could have brought forward if they had so wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate on Tuesday, I argued that simply to try to keep pest infestation from the kitchens is impossible unless hygiene regulations are applied throughout NHS premises. Cockroaches, feral cats and mice do not recognise boundaries. They do not agree to remain in the kitchen. Nor do they say, "If you eradicate us from the kitchen, we shall not enter it from outside." Such a suggestion is ridiculous. Pests will stay in the ducting system and in the wards and it will be ineffective simply to try to apply the food regulations and their cleanliness aspect only in the kitchens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Minister reply to my argument? The answer to that is no. He merely said something about the innappropriateness of the amendment and expressed sorrow that other amendments had not been selected. Of those that were selected, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but they would not have any effect on the Bill except to introduce some rather superfluous wording."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 29 April 1986; c.23.]</p></blockquote>
I find the Minister's argument dismal. Surely, he recognises that there is a serious problem of vermin infestation in our hospitals, that the clause deals with it only partially and that its provisions will not cure the problem. He could have said that he would consider the matter further and, perhaps, give more powers to environmental health officers so that our hospitals can be rid completely of vermin infestation. But he did not do so. He hid behind the technicality of the amendment by saying that it was defective and that some amendments that relied on it were not selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the position immensely depressing, but we have had three years of a depressing Government. However, it will not be long before the Government change, which is what the public—as evidenced by opinion polls—increasingly want as time goes on. The clause should contain provisions about making available information to employees, as it is under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, although the Government have no intention of applying its provisions to National Health Service premises. It would be interesting to hear the Minister's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
The problem will be helped only by co-operation. If it is made easy for staff to report sightings of cockroaches and other vermin, infestation is more likely to be eradicated from NHS hospitals. I know that systems exist where staff are supposed to log such matters, but I understand that, in practice, it is difficult for them to carry out that process. Hospitals are communities and people must work together. Staff could be encouraged to co-operate if information were made available to them. If such a provision were included in the clause, we would have a better Bill than at present. Therefore, will the Government provide through regulations or a circular—if they cannot do so on Report—that information is made available to staff, so that there can be a co-operative spirit in trying to keep our hospitals clean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the First Lord of the Treasury spends only a sufficient amount of money on the National Health Service. The Government tell us that they are spending 24 per cent, more since 1979 and that that is a real increase, but that is all pie in the sky. They base their figures on the wrong index; They use the RPI and not the medical index. They do not compare like with like. People do not believe the Government anyway. They see wards closing at weekends, emergency units closing for periods and entire hospitals closing down. In London, waiting lists for operations have grown substantially in the past six months. Whatever the Government say, they are either not providing any money to the Health Service or misproviding it. During the past six years under this Government the Health Service has worsened, and the crisis is there for all to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the Committee can have a general debate on the Health Service. We are confined to discussing the provisions of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. I was merely making a passing remark. I wish to discuss the matter referred to by my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), which is the financial effect of clause 1. The Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 has no implications for public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
That is a bare-faced lie. Clause 1 will have implications for public expenditure, and I defy the Minister to provide a logical justification for the statement that it will not. Many millions of pounds will have to be spent in hospitals if they are to do their jobs properly and hospital kitchens are brought up to the required standard. If the Government were trying to be honest, such a statement would not be included in the Bill. I can only accuse the Government of double-think, double-thought and downright deception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies I hope that he will say, "We don't actually mean that there will be an increase in public expenditure." If the Minister does not say that, the country will judge his words for what they are. I shall not comment on those words because I will be ruled out of order and have to withdraw my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the section on "Financial Effect" the Bill states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Effect on Public Service Manpower</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Bill has no manpower implications."</p></blockquote>
That statement includes clause 1 and, apparently, that clause has no "manpower implications". Surely that cannot be the case when environmental health officers' time is already stretched inspecting buildings throughout the country. When the Bill is enacted officers will have to inspect premises more thoroughly because they will have the power to issue enforcement notices and to prosecute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, the environmental health officers will have to inspect hospital kitchens—that will become a major part of their job—and other parts of the hospital as a direct statutory duty. How can that duty be carried out without employing more environmental health officers or, at least, assistants to those officers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me back to the argument that if the Government really want the Bill to work they must provide the required manpower. My honourable Friend the Member for Cathcart rightly said that we can talk all day and pass legislation but what good will that achieve if it cannot be implemented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation will require environmental health officers to augment their staffs to ensure that the Act works properly. Therefore, how can the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill has no manpower implications."?</p></blockquote>
That statement defies logic, and I defy the Minister to justify that statement with a logical argument and not bluff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, clause 1 is a crumb for the table that I shall accept. I shall not vote against it standing part of the Bill, subject to what is said by my honourable Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson). The clause does not go far enough but I hope that my honourable Friends will not object to it. It is not good enough for our people, however, and I have grave doubts that the clause can be applied if manpower is not increased and many extra pounds are not spent to bring hospital kitchens up to the standard required by the food regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave reservations that anything will be achieved unless the Government revise their opinion. Principally, I am concerned that clause 1 does not go far enough. However, it is a crumb and I would rather have a crumb than nothing from this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friends have expressed serious reservations about clause 1. We welcome the principle of lifting Crown immunity from hospitals to make them safer, better places for those who are patients, those who work in them and those who visit patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not conjured our reservations out of the air. They are being expressed by the organisations whose pressure during the past decade has finally forced the Government to acknowledge that Crown immunity should be removed, at least partially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must acknowledge that hospitals are dangerous places. They are full of sick people who may infect one another and those who look after them and visit them. Hospitals are also full of dangerous materials and substances, the purpose of which may be benign. Many processes that take place in hospitals may be dangerous to patients and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Society ought to take special care to ensure that hospitals are safer and that the intrinsic dangers are kept to a minimum. However, we do not do so. There is a catch-22 situation and a feeling that death and disease are taped in hospitals. Nothing could be further from the truth. Hospitals may be able to cope with the diseases and injuries that necessitate people being in hospital but they are not very good at coping with the dangers and problems that arise within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recently those outside the hospital service tended to shy away from interference on the grounds that expert professionals understand and are aware of the problems, and are capable of coping with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago two people in my constituency died of smallpox. They had visited an elderly relative in hospital and in the next bed a patient was suffering from smallpox, unbeknown to anyone. The smallpox resulted from experiments at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. During the subsequent inquiry the environmental health officers in Camden were asked why they had not more closely supervised the experiments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The honourable Gentleman is going rather wide of the clause, which covers food legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to demonstrate people's reluctance to interfere with technical medical processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When asked why they had not supervised more closely the work on smallpox, the environmental health officers said that they would have needed expert advice. A QC asked from whom they would have obtained that advice, to which they replied, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That was the place on which they were meant to keep an eye. Although that example refers to experiments, it has a bearing on our general attitude to what is happening in hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament introduced legislation applying to other less dangerous materials and processes in places that are less dangerous than hospitals and occupied by people who are less vulnerable, such as guests in a hotel or restaurant. Yet, we have allowed Crown immunity to protect hospitals from laws that were intended to improve matters for people who are fundamentally less exposed than those who work or are treated in hospitals. We have allowed that to happen, in our wisdom or lack of it, and I am not blaming the Government especially for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Government's decision to lift Crown immunity from food regulations, but despite the Minister's assurance that that will apply in all parts of hospitals and for all stages of preparation, distribution, consumption and disposal of food, I am advised that that is not correct. I am not suggesting that the Minister tried to mislead us as it is a complicated matter, but I hope that he will reexamine it and come back on Report if my worries are correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from earlier debates that certain types
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
of vermin have been identified which are not covered in the Bill, but the Minister has rejected an extension of it. The clause lifts Crown immunity from food regulations, but it does not cover other matters, such as hygiene in hospitals. If we accept that it is wrong to have a dirty kitchen, it is illogical not to object to a dirty ward, a dirty yard outside the hospital or even a dirty operating theatre which are still protected by Crown immunity. That is unsatisfactory so the Bill is both inconsistent and dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is growing anxiety about the cleaning services in hospitals, privatised or not. I am trying to be objective but there has been a noticeable decline in standards of cleanliness in hospitals. Until fairly recently, I cannot recall receiving letters of complaint about the cleanliness of wards, but that happens now. It is time to improve the cleanliness of hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer, in passing, to the new clause which has been tabled by my right honourable Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent (Mr. Ashley).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will only be in passing. The honourable Gentleman knows that it has been selected and we shall discuss it fully later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to say only that we hope that the Minister will see the logic of extending the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to everyone in hospitals to provide a health and safety provision in places which are fundamentally dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister refused to accept our amendment to clause 1(2)	<i>(b)</i>. He described the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a prudent contingency provision to cover the possibility that the application of food legislation may not fit the way in which health authorities are constituted."</p></blockquote>
That baffled me as I did not know what he meant, and no explanation was offered. I was so struck by that that I did not notice his next remark, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lawyers, from their vast experience of legislation"—</p></blockquote>
what poor experience that has been—
	<br><blockquote><p>"have seen that difficulties could arise over implementing a provision to remove Crown immunity from food legislation.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 29 April 1986; c. 12.]</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the difficulties that those far-sighted lawyers envisaged. The words "far-sighted" and "lawyers" do not normally run together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having suspicious minds, my honourable Friends and I—and people outside—feel that there are difficulties which accountants rather than lawyers have identified. Some hospital kitchens are a stinking mess. We know that it will cost a good deal to put them right. The inquiry into the Stanley Royd hospital suggested £680,000 would be required to put its kitchens right. An estimate of £1.5 million has been suggested to put matters right at St. Thomas' hospital across the river. Between 70 and 100 hospitals are currently operating sub-standard kitchens. If we allowed, say, £500,000 to cover the smaller improvements that will be required under the legislation, we may need £100 million. That is why my honourable Friends and I were taken aback by the statement in the financial memorandum which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 has no implications for public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
If there is to be no additional public expenditure, that money must be found from health authorities' existing budgets. The Minister must tell us where that money will come from in the six-months or the year within which the Bill will come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be knocked out of St. Thomas' budget? Where will it find £1.5 million? Will it stop further research into renal failure? Will it close more wards? At present, the West Lambeth health authority is considering closing the hospital throughout August except for emergency admissions. Clearly, that authority will not want the Bill to come into operation within the next year, or even in the year after that. That is because it will not be able to do the necessary work unless the Government provide additional funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might argue that if the kitchens are so bad, they should be closed and that outside contractors should be brought in to provide food. Perhaps that is another explanation for various combinations of the clause with the financial memorandum. However, that is not the right way to get food supplies for important hospitals. There is not much evidence to show that reputable food companies are prepared to take on the work. The reputable firm of Trusthouse Forte is withdrawing from rather than extending into the work, despite the blandishments offered by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is serious, where will he find the money to implement clause 1 as quickly and as effectively as Parliament has been led to believe? We do not wish to divide the Committee, but we shall remain dissatisfied if the Minister cannot provide satisfactory answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) referred to what I said at column 12 of 	<i>Hansard</i> about lawyers and their vast experience. If he changed "seen" to indicated and "could" to might, it would better reflect what I wanted to convey. I am grateful to him for allowing me to make that correction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Committee's general welcome to the clause. I do not wish to follow the rather sour comments of the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), whose world started, apparently, in May 1979. He seems to have no recollection of anything that occurred prior to that date. It might be appropriate, in view of what the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, to explain that pressures have been exerted over the past decade for lifting Crown immunity. When that pressure was being exerted for the first time, the then Labour Government did not believe that the lifting of Crown immunity was appropriate. They issued a circular in 1977—it was a good one— and I shall refer to it again later. It should be absolutely clear that Crown immunity was always maintained by the Labour Government. If the Conservative Government's action of lifting Crown immunity can be criticised as pathetic and abyssmal—to use the words of the honourable Member for Wrexham—I take it, Sir Philip, that you would rule out of order the honourable Gentleman's comments about the actions or inactions of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Labour Government on the same issue. I do not wish to dwell on the honourable Gentleman's rather sour comments because our debate has shown clear support for the content and intention of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras referred to the representations made by the president of the British Pest Control Association. On amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10, there was talk about mice, birds and feral cats not being covered by existing food hygiene regulations. I thought that I had made it clear then that we were giving careful consideration to the representations made by the association, which suggests amending the food regulations, rather than using primary legislation, to deal with the problem. I reiterate that we are considering that representation. The same applies to other representations made by the association. For example, the association refers to certain areas in hospitals, such as day rooms and ward kitchens where food is handled, being excluded from food hygiene regulations, and we shall take that into account. The honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will recognise that it is appropriate to deal with that matter in food regulations rather than in primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other comments in our debate have been centred mainly on manpower and finance. The honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) asked about improved management and put his finger on the vital issue which has been so vividly illustrated by the Stanley Royd inquiry. Anyone who read and considered that inquiry with care must have been gravely concerned about the serious lack of supervision and management over a long period in the running of the kitchens. That lack of supervision had a direct bearing upon the tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the view that it is essential to ensure that catering staff are properly trained and supervised in hygiene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. I listened for a considerable time to Opposition Members and I hope that they will allow me to develop my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Correct procedures, backed by firm supervision and management, are the essential requirements to guard against unhygienic practices and to maintain high standards of hygiene. That is why the Government are strengthening their guidance on the expected standards of food hygiene and pest control throughout the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We plan to discuss the new draft with interested organisations, such as the Institution of Environmental Health Officers and the British Pest Control Association. We then plan to issue guidance without delay. The hotel services branch of the DHSS will be issuing a revised version of its food hygiene catering manual. I think that that matter was linked with the circular issued by the previous Labour Government in July 1977. The existing version of that document was praised by the Stanley Royd inquiry committee and it is now being revised to take account of the lessons learnt in that inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
That manual will be widely circulated among National Health Service catering staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the Stanley Royd inquiry tended to blame people who worked in the kitchens and their immediate management? The inquiry identified them as being almost solely responsible for the incident. However, a great part of the report shows that there had been protracted wrangles among the health authorities, the district council, the regional health authority and some of the Minister's officials. Those who worked in the kitchens said that money needed to be spent on them. We do not wish to give a total clean bill of health to the people working in the kitchens or the immediate management, but it must be recognised that no one involved in that incident came out of it with a clean bill of health. They were all responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely happy that people should read that report and learn all the lessons from it. We have circulated the report widely and I am absolutely sure that it will be a case study for people in training for many years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering carefully the training needs of NHS staff dealing with pest control. The Department runs a week's course, which has been attended by more than 400 members of staff over the past seven years. Health authorities are encouraged to take up training being offered by local environmental health officers. We are exploring a welcome offer from the British Pest Control Association to provide training for NHS staff. There is much activity taking place on guidance, advice and training for staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably that training costs money.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the honourable Gentleman was not listening when I said that I would come to the financial aspects shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the provision in the clause for environmental health officers to have access to hospital kitchens so that they may visit the kitchens more often. I remind the Committee that that access was guaranteed in the July 1977 circular. I am not aware that any environmental health officers or their staff have been denied access. If that has occurred, the matter should have been dealt with by the authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not changing the access provision but we are providing legal backing for it. By lifting Crown immunity we are allowing environmental health officers who are not satisfied to take legal action if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members queried the statement in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum that clause 1 has no implications for public expenditure and public service manpower. We have followed the standard procedures for drawing up the statements in accordance with Treasury rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enactment of clause 1 will not alter the public expenditure and manpower provisions of the National Health Service. Public expenditure for
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
1986 and 1987 has been agreed and approved by the House. As reference has been made to capital spending, I remind the Committee that the Government are making £768 million available to health authorities in England for capital spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to deal with this matter, which I know is unwelcome to the honourable Member for Wrexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, it is estimated that health authorities will raise £130 million from the sale of land and property. The NHS will retain those funds, so almost £900 million will be available for capital work in 1986-87. Within that total the health authorities must decide their priorities. Some authorities may re-order their priorities as a result of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I remind the Committee of the terms of the circular issued by the previous Labour Government and endorsed by the present Government. The circular stated that Crown exemption from food hygiene regulations and the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 should not be an excuse for tolerating standards below those set out in legislation. It has been clear since 1977 that Crown immunity should not alter the basic position that was set out by the Labour Government. I have never suggested that that circular was hypocritical. I have always accepted that it represented a sincere, deliberate and considered attempt to improve standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Wrexham referred to the comments of my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister last November and I referred earlier to the report of the Environmental Health Officers Association and my meeting with an all-party delegation led by the right honourable Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley). We said on those occasions that careful consideration was being given to the lifting of Crown immunity, and that has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought not to exaggerate the implications for health authorities, and the honourable Gentleman may be doing so. Successive Governments have told health authorities that they are expected to comply with food legislation. The 1977 circular was very clear on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the extra funds that are available to the hospital service this year. I remember the statement of his right honourable Friend the Secretary of State in which he stated that additional funds of approximately 6 per cent, will be available against an inflation rate of 4.75 per cent. Will the Minister tell the Committee how much of that extra money will be found within the hospital service as a result of supposed cost-efficiency savings.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the honourable Gentleman is confusing revenue expenditure with capital

expenditure. He referred to inflation, and it is relevant that the estimate of 4.5 per cent, has been reduced. Therefore, more resources will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined that the high standard of hospital catering that is achieved by most hospitals shall be regarded as the norm throughout the National Health Service. The removal of Crown immunity from health authorities regarding food legislation is an important part of a larger process. We seek to increase awareness in the NHS of the need to give food hygiene a higher priority and to strengthen management control to ensure effective action to raise and maintain high standards in hospitals.

Clause 1 makes a contribution to that process and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19 in page 3, line 18, after 'supply;', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and, if they consist of or include the provision of counselling, details of counselling areas established for this purpose; and, if they consist of or include the provision of domiciliary services, details thereof;'.</p></blockquote>
This is one of the more important proposed amendments to clause 2. Pharmaceutical services are an important aspect of health care and I hope that all members of the Committee agree that we should desire the best possible service for everyone in both rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas there are too many pharmacies and in others there are too few. In some areas many services are provided and in others they are minimal and could be greatly improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to improve public knowledge of the services provided by pharmacies and to give impetus to the Government and the profession to provide better services. It seeks to add to the clause a requirement that applications shall state whether there will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision of counselling, details of counselling areas established for this purpose; and, if they consist of or include the provision of domiciliary services, details thereof".</p></blockquote>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of counselling is important because when people go to a pharmacist with a prescription it is very easy for that pharmacist, from his podium or dais, to take the prescription, ask for the money or an exemption certificate and, without any interaction with the patient, make up the prescription in five or 10 minutes and hand back the prescription. We can improve that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, many patients are ignorant about what is available. When they are ill, they go to a doctor who cannot spend much time with them— doctors would like to but cannot. Given the number of doctors and the frequency of visits, many doctors can spend only two or three minutes with a patient. The doctor—dependent upon his diagnosis—will
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
write out a prescription and say, "I hope these will make you better. If they don't come back and see me in a week's time."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible for a doctor to spend perhaps five, 10, or 15 minutes talking to a patient either to reassure him or her or to explain symptoms, the best remedy and, perhaps, suggest alternative drugs that may be available. I know doctors do that when they can, but there are too many restrictions on their time and they must have a list of priorities. Doctors may regard an illness or ailment as serious for an older patient and not so serious for patients who are younger and healthier. However, other calls on their time mean that they cannot always discuss an illness or ailment fully with their patients. They are unable to discuss what can be done, different drugs, or whether patients should change their lifestyles, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, pharmacists have no remit to do that, and they should have. I believe that pharmacists would want a remit for this service. It is a complementary service because doctors suffer from the problem that drugs keep changing because technological advance carries on regardless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors are under severe pressure from drug companies to try different remedies and they do not have the up-to-date knowledge and experience to know whether a particular drug would be useful to a patient or whether an alternative, should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that doctors can telephone pharmacists in such cases, and also that there are plenty of drug companies which employ travelling salesmen—a few years ago the figure was seven doctors to one travelling drug salesman, which is an extremely high number. There is a legitimate need for drug companies to inform doctors of the availability of different products, but they are not giving an independent assessment. It is necessary for the drug industry to provide such information, and it would be useful to have an independent professional assessment of different drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pharmacists are professionals and they could have the opportunity to improve the Health Service for the public if only we would give it to them, and that is what the amendment seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will enable a higher standard of pharmaceutical service to be available to a patient. Pharmacists could provide little alcoves in the pharmacy where they could talk to patients and tell them about the drugs available. They could tell the patient that a doctor had prescribed one drug but that there were others, and advise the patient about remedies that may, or may not, be available on prescription. If there were rooms or counselling areas which were confidential, or private, that would reassure many patients. If a person wants only a prescription for a cold, that does not matter, but some people are peculiarly sensitive about some of their illnesses and will not want to discuss them with a pharmacist in front of a queue of five or six others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a counselling area is available, it need only take three, four or five minutes for the pharmacist to advise patients. If that is an initial advice session, which I shall not argue for—I do not expect the pharmacist to take the place of the doctor—there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
are many minor ailments on which the pharmacist could give advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government think along these lines because there are certain cases where nurses, particularly district nurses, can prescribe for minor ailments. I think the Government have that in mind because they have raised the issue in their discussion papers. Therefore, the service that could be provided by pharmacists should be nothing new to the Government. If such a scheme would improve health care—I believe that it would—are the Government prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If counselling areas are provided, patients will receive privacy of advice, full access to pharmaceutical advice and health education, which is something doctors would dearly love to give to their patients. As I have said, the constraints on time make that difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is better to spend more time on preventative care than curing illness. I hope the Government will recognise that we must put more emphasis on preventative care than on curing people, and it is that which the amendment seeks to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a pharmacist provides counselling, he could make a point of ensuring that he is up to date with the newest drugs available, either on prescription or not, so that he could advise the patient accordingly. The patient would then have more information services at his disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals also with domiciliary services. It is important for us to try to get pharmacists to deliver drugs to certain people. Old people of 70 or 80 years demand more attention because they fall ill more often. It is difficult for an old person to walk one mile—or 2 km—to get to a pharmacist. I believe that pharmacists would welcome the opportunity to deliver drugs to certain patients—perhaps some pharmacists already do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can confirm that. But would it not be a good idea for that service to be generally available? I know that that is not part of the amendment, but if in the contract the Government recognise that service, it could be achieved under regulations. The amendment seeks only to make the public aware that such and such a pharmacist performs such and such a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would provide collection and delivery to patients homes in appropriate circumstances as part of the domiciliary services. For example, oxygen and appliance-fitting services would be useful to patients if they were included in the regulations and clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, advice on pharmaceutical services in nursing homes and other residential establishments, and provision of services to the mentally and physically handicapped and the elderly, would also be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I include those items in the broad term of domiciliary services. If they could be included in the regulations and the clause, that would help the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
member of the public who wants health care but is unsure of the best way to go about getting it, and ends up by going to a doctor if he thinks that the ailment calls for more than a pharmacist's care. If the ailment proves not to be serious, the doctor may not be able to give the patient the time that he would like to make available to him. If the ailment is serious, I am sure that doctors find sufficient time, but if it is not—I say this in no way trying to denigrate the medical profession—they cannot always spend as much time on a case as they would like to because of the pressure of work, and so we are left with the pharmacist. Here we have a gap. We have the pharmacists who, I believe, want to provide the service which I have outlined. All that is lacking is the will, and if the Government can provide that we can make a step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to support my honourable Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), and in doing so I pay tribute to the many pharmacists throughout the country who give a first-class service to the community. I underline "community", because pharmacists and chemists' shops have for many years been integral parts of the communities they serve and have won the confidence of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my honourable Friend because I want to underline the point that some of the proposals in his amendment are implemented already. Such services greatly profit the public who seek advice. I believe that people should seek advice from the professionally qualified—that is a matter of course—and from those with whom they feel most comfortable and can talk to freely. I have a case in mind. The pharmacist who serves the residents of a large estate in my constituency, and my family, has been serving the area for many years and provides, among other things, a counselling service of sorts. People avail themselves of his service because they often need to ask what they consider to be elementary questions not worth consulting their general practitioner about. In the course of visiting the shop they feel better able to mention those simple matters. A common and relevant question, having been prescribed a drug or medicine, is, "What is being pumped into me?" I have heard that question asked when I have been in the chemist's shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that discussions are taking place with the object of shifting some of the onus of counselling on a certain range of matters from general practitioners to pharmacists. I welcome that shift as a rationalisation and redistribution of the load. It will enable advice to be given to ordinary people in the best way. I do not think that we have sufficiently thought out counselling and preventive medicine to arrive at the right distribution. I believe that pharmacists have a greater role to play and that, besides adding words to the text, amendment No. 19 is farsighted in looking to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn my honourable Friend the Member for Wrexham that we must be aware of two possible difficulties. First, if there are to be counselling areas and services they must be arranged with professional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
sensitivity. I shall not put it so strongly as to suggest that there may be lines of demarcation, but professional contention could arise in certain areas. If the Minister is entertaining the idea behind the amendment—I hope that he is—it must be carefully thought out, along with widespread and detailed consultation. Nevertheless, I stress that I believe the idea to be good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Wrexham rightly said that general practitioners are under pressure from pharmaceutical companies—the drug industry. In a sense, this is a sort of commercial pressure, but pharmacists and chemists' shops often are under that pressure so my second note of warning is that there must be a close look at that angle and the provisions of safeguards. My honourable Friend was right when he said that the amendment proposes a further rationalisation of a counselling service. Even if the wording of the amendment is defective, it contains the germ of an extremely good idea, which I believe already is part of established thinking and of the discussions taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, my honourable Friend mentioned domiciliary services, which many community chemists throughout the country already provide. They go out of their way to do so when ordinary people are in difficulty, and take immense time and trouble. We can take great encouragement from that effort, and the amendment seeks to build on it. I hope that the Minister will, therefore, give it his sympathetic consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to support the amendment. I go along entirely with the remarks of the honourable Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). His final point that this approach is already—to use his words— "part of established thinking" is underlined by two developments—the Nuffield report and the Government's Green Paper. One of the most encouraging features of the Green Paper is, of course, what is not in it and might have been, according to reports that were circulating last year. Another encouraging feature is what is in it—the attitude that we should be moving towards a broader definition of primary care, more integrated primary care services and a more responsive system of primary care in terms of the relative needs of the community. That is sensible and will, I think, command widespread support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that occurred to me when the honourable Member for Wrexham moved the amendment was that clearly there are various disciplinary and professional attitudes and sensitivities to be respected in moving towards a more integrated system. No structure, however good, can compensate for rigidly sectarian professional attitudes, and I greatly hope that the professions concerned will take full advantage of the consultation period now open to them until the end of this year. I hope, too, that the Government, will be appreciative of the sensitivities that will arise when dealing with the broader delivery of
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
pharmaceutical services, especially in a rural area such as my own, although the general point of principle is the same for any part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, if the nursing profession is to play a broader role, there are bound to be legitimate and proper expressions of concern from the medical profession, including general practitioners, about the exact nature of the proposal and how it will affect their duties and obligations. For example, as one who is arguing for a more integrated primary health care team and approach and as one who would support the idea of a career structure for community nurses and of patients being able to consult various members of the primary health care scheme, including pharmacists and others, I know that such matters have implications for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a good one and, like the honourable Member for Ipswich, I think that it reflects current thinking. Clearly, anything that we can do and that the Government can do to forward it after the Bill is enacted would be welcome. Moreover, it is clear from the views expressed by representatives of pharmacists, by the nursing sector and by others that there will be a positive and constructive response from within the medical profession, which will provide us with the opportunity to move the emphasis in health care towards greater counselling, more health education and towards more preventive priority being given. Therefore, the emphasis in the Health Service on excellent and necessary crisis intervention will move towards preventing bad health and promoting good health. The pharmacist has a crucial role to play. I am sure that the Government will act in the spirit of this good amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Ray Whitney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to agree with very much of what has been said by the honourable Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) and for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) in respect of the amendment. The honourable Members for Wrexham and for Ross, Cromarty and Skye spoke about health education and disease prevention, both of which are extremely high on the Government's list of priorities. I hope that honourable Members have noted the activities of the Health Education Council. Moreover, I very much hope that several new initiatives in that area will be taken before long. Personally, I am disturbed by the intense public concentration on the development of the hospital services when the emphasis is on old hospitals being closed rather than on the many new hospitals that are being opened. Each of us spends a period in hospital once every five years—that is a medium figure—but one gains the impression that most of us spend much of our time in hospitals. As a nation, we should continue to concentrate on health education, and in that respect we are at one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at one in our wish to develop pharmacy services to the full and to make the most effective use of the skills of pharmacists, which is the burden of the amendment's message. I also agree with the honourable Member for Ipswich that much of that is being done already. The message from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
pharmacists' professional bodies already urges them to provide considerable guidance. For example, on average, one in three pharmacists provides a domiciliary oxygen service. So far we agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between us is one of need and timing. First, any extension of the pharmaceutical services is covered by existing legislation and would not require further primary legislation. Indeed, it would be neither necessary nor appropriate in an application for a pharmacy contract. To that extent, the amendment is unnecessary. But, more importantly, it comes at the wrong stage, given that so many other developments must be harmonised. The honourable Member for Ipswich emphasised the need for careful consultation and we are engaged upon precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nuffield report, to which much attention has been paid, is now in the public domain as part of the debate on the concept of a wider role for the pharmacist. More importantly, there is the impact and the outcome of the primary care discussion document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the remarks made by the honourable Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye. The consultative document on primary care has been warmly received and widely acknowledged as a positive step forward, which is right and justified because we are seeking much better co-ordination of all health care services directed at providing patient, consumer and customer satisfaction. The role of the pharmacist in these developments will be of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the processes were started by the launch of the Nuffield report and our consultation document, several steps remain to be taken. We must consult, among others, the medical profession. Therefore it would not be right to take a further firm step forward now as that would negate the consultation process that have started. Furthermore, the excellent report on community nursing services—headed by Julia Cumberlege—is an important part of the general debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I agree with the spirit that motivated the tabling of the amendment, I urge the Committee not to accept it. The details in the amendment are unnecessary both in terms of the granting of a pharmacy contract, and in terms of the broader development of the wider role of the pharmacist as a contribution to our general structure of health care, it is premature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reply briefly to the debate. I thank the Under-Secretary of State for his reply and for putting things so nicely. He said that the time was not ripe, that the Government had to consult and that we should not fuss as he agreed with us. I am glad that the honourable Gentleman said that we are at one. Unfortunately, he gave the stock Government reply on such amendments. The effect of it is that the Government see the merit in an amendment but they do not want to accept it because extra problems would be created, and Ministers already have enough work on their desks each morning. So they make the excuses that the amendment is not quite right, that they must discuss it and that it might be dealt with next Session, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
The amendment is important. It does not say that pharmacists must provide the services, but pharmacists who provided extra services would be shown as doing so. Clause 2(2) uses the word "shall", not "may". It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations shall include provision … for the preparation and publication by a Committee of one or more lists of persons".</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 	<i>(b),</i> it states
	<br><blockquote><p>"that an application to a Committee for the inclusion in such a list shall be made in the prescribed manner and shall state … the services which the applicant will undertake to provide".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that if certain services were not provided, they would not be put on lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are peripheral services that are not commonly used. Moreover, there are services that we wish to be provided regularly, in the next decade perhaps, but which now are being provided only here and there. Part of our reason for tabling the amendment was that it sought to clarify and concentrate on the issue. Such services as counselling and providing domiciliary services are available in some pharmacies but we do not know whether they are available in many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not require the Government or the relevant committee to put an applicant on the list because he provided the services. But I believe that the amendment would provide an incentive. I agree with my honourable Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), who referred to possible interface problems between the two professions—pharmacists on one side and the medical profession on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suffer from hay fever and get tablets from my doctor every year. Thank goodness, I do not suffer as much as some people. My period of discomfort lasts only from the end of June to the end of July. In the past three or four years, I have not seen the doctor, but have asked the nurse for a repeat prescription. I am sure that many other people do the same. We do not wish to trouble doctors with our hay fever problems as we know what they are and that we shall be all right again in August.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there have been technological advances and there are now many hay fever tablets, some of which send us to sleep. Others are mild and there are some which have no effect. In the past three years, pharmacists have provided me with much information about what is currently available on the market. My doctor may have also given me that information had I visited him, but I felt that I should not take up his time discussing my hay fever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a place for a pharmacist saying, "Yes, you have hay fever. Have you seen your doctor at least once?" He must ask that as some people may suffer from allergies and their general practitioner should tell them whether they can take hay fever tablets. In succeeding years, they can then go to pharmacists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there are problems which must be discussed if pharmacists are to perform counselling duties. The Government must talk to the British Medicial Association and pharmacists, which will not happen overnight. Our amendment does not seek to institute formally the provision of such services, but is merely a suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
We thank the Minister for his helpful reply but we shall divide the Committee to underline that we wish the Government to consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the negative reaction of my honourable Friend the Minister to the amendment. Surely, we all wish to improve the standard of pharmaceutical services, which is the aim of the Green Paper and the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate his problem of timing and understand that he does not want to build into the Bill something that may or may not emerge from the eventual discussions on the consultation paper. I understand that the Committee will consider the information given to it when deciding whether to issue contracts. If there was more than one application for a contract and the Committee felt that there was scope for one contractor only, it would need as much information as possible about the services that each pharmacist would offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not repeat the services that they could offer, as the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) explained them. We are not discussing a new idea—some chemists already offer such services. I cannot believe, whatever the outcome of the consultations on the Green Paper, that it will be decided that pharmacists should not provide the services that we are discussing, although there may be a rather more structured form of providing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my honourable Friend, the Minister will be more sympathetic. We could find ourselves with the Bill enacted, the outcome of the Green Paper known, yet having to wait another year or two before giving it legislative effect, by which time we shall have missed the opportunity that is now before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the anxiety of my honourable Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), but insist that we are at one in wishing to improve the contribution which pharmacists' services provide for health care. I am merely worried about the timing and the necessity of the amendment. Clause 2(2)	<i>(b)</i> states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) the services which the applicant will undertake to provide … and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) the premises from which he will undertake to provide those services".</p></blockquote>
That covers the information required by the Committee in deciding whether to issue a contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Chislehurst is justifiably suspicious about Governments delaying putting good thoughts into legal effect. Depending on the outcome of the consultations, it is likely that the extension of pharmaceutical services would be covered by existing legislation, so will not require further primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the honourable Member for Wrexham felt that it would not be right to truncate the consultation process which is important and long overdue. We are now taking a good, long, hard look at primary health care. It is an important subject so we should not rush in on a little amendment when it is not absolutely necessary for pharmacy contracts. Indeed, we could risk upsetting the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 28, in page 5, line 4, at end insert 'and—
	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) the arrangements made for drug security.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 20 refers to drug security. It is not directed to whether there will be a certain level of drug security, because I hope that that will be a requirement placed on applicants wishing to be put on a list. It is about whether such information will be available to the family practitioner committee when it decides whether to grant an application. I hope that in due course the Government will be able to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations shall include provision".</p></blockquote>
and it refers to services. Drugs and their security are not a service to the public. When a person visits a pharmacy, he wants tablets, ointment or some drugs. The security of drugs is a different matter. As I understand it, the clause does not refer to the premises from which an applicant will undertake to provide such services, except that it insists on identification of them. There are no provisions in subsection (2)	<i>(a)</i> and 	<i>(b)</i> about whether those premises shall be secure. If drugs are held anywhere, it is important that they are secured in a safe manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Addicts may be taking prohibited drugs which they could not obtain on prescription. But they might be able to obtain the drugs if they visit a doctor who advises them on a course of drugs to cure their addiction. That is how things should be done. Unfortunately, there are criminals who want to obtain drugs so that they can provide them to those who are addicted, and it is not unknown for break-ins to take place on pharmaceutical premises. It is normally easier to break into small pharmacies because there are more such premises than wholesale depots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the cost of providing security. It has fallen in recent years, and there are more efficient ways of providing security than the old-fashioned bolt, or padlock. For example, premises could be fitted with double-glazing or infra-red
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
detectors, which are efficient and reasonably cheap. A person could buy an infra-red detector for about £50, together with an adequate security system for about £500 or £600. Certainly, if a person spent £1,000 on such a system, it would provide proper security for his premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the committee should know the whereabouts of an applicant's premises. The premises might be in a delapidated state, and if an application is granted the applicant may convert them into a pharmacy. It is important to know what that applicant will do to provide security and whether he will invest sufficient funds to ensure that the drugs are secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot at the moment see any argument against the amendment and I hope that the Government will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I must disappoint the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). Misuse of drugs is a serious matter and many initiatives have been launched by my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister and the ministerial group on the misuse of drugs under the chairmanship of my honourable Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. Much effort and energy and many resources have been devoted to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One initiative was the report of the advisory council on the misuse of drugs about the security of controlled drugs. The report set out various criteria, urged all doctors and pharmacists to assess the adequacy of their security, and made some recommendations. All independent contractors are expected to provide adequate security to standards laid down and controlled by the pharmacy profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we considered the recommendations of the advisory council we took account of the change of circumstances since the preparation of the report. The threat to licit stocks especially appeared to be less severe than when the report was prepared. However, I am not suggesting that the security of drugs in pharmacies is not important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement is a continuing one and it should not merely determine whether an application for a pharmacy contract is accepted. Applications should state the location and services to be provided to enable family practitioner committees to decide whether the necessary and desirable criteria have been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not relevant to the issue covered by the clause—the granting of contracts to pharmacists—because all pharmacies should meet the standards to which I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed with the Minister's reply. There is a tendency to suggest that crime can be dealt with by the police, armed with water canons, helicopters, computers and machine pistols, for example. However, we all know that a multi-agency approach is necessary. The Government have accepted that in respect of some issues, and the law enforcement agencies certainly agree. Everyone should be looking constantly for
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
ways of reducing the opportunities for people to commit crimes and harm the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The family practitioner committees, especially in their new and extended manifestation, are responsible for the general health of the people in their areas. If pharmacies are run by slap-happy people who do not care about security, items may be stolen that will damage people's health. Therefore, the family practitioner committees have an obligation to try to prevent the misuse of drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that this small amendment will have earth-shattering effects, but the only way in which we can resist and fight back against the extent of drug addiction and the attendant crime is by small increments of effort and thought wherever the problem arises. Therefore, the Government should accept our proposal. We are prepared to accept that something may be wrong with the detail of our proposal but the Minister should be prepared to impose an obligation on the family practitioner committee to consider security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are differences between pharmacies, and if it were known that a little group pharmacy with half a dozen premises was notorious for being slap-happy about its security, it would be perfectly acceptable for a family practitioner committee to say that it had received an application, knew that the group did not care, that the police complained about it, and that drug addicts were constantly getting materials from the premises, and had accordingly—for legitimate reasons—rejected the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that to protect a locality, to promote health preservation and the various duties of a family practitioner committee, and to help the police and everyone fighting against drug addiction, and the crime that goes with it, the Government should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was tabled to enable the Minister to tell us how the family practitioner committee will consider applications when they are received. If an application is received in an area where the committee may believe that there are plenty of people providing run-of-the-mill pharmaceutical services, but not many providing appliances or counselling services—it will not know that now, of course, but there will be a good deal of information on the list—how will it judge the value and priority attached to one service or another? Will it treat them all as vital or will it say, "We don't necessarily need so many pharmacists to provide this service, although the applicant provides it. As the application is at the bottom of our list, we shall not allow it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) in probing gently. As he said, the amendment provides an opportunity to find out a little more about the thinking behind this procedure. We are in a dilemma inasmuch as it is difficult to know how much is or should be written onto the face of the Bill and how much in regulations. We have seen a draft of the regulations and we now have an opportunity to probe their possible content and to express our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause is drawn, it is possible that an applicant contractor will not be accepted simply because he does not provide a handful of services. Equally, if someone can offer a range of services, the committee can say, "We already have a pharmacist here who can offer most of the services, so we shall not give a contract to those who offer the full range."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect. To what extent will the services offered by the pharmacist form part of the contract? Presumably, if his application states that he intends to offer various services and he fails to provide them, he has reneged on his contract, but is he restricted in providing those services? Can he provide services other than those that he has undertaken to provide? One can visualise someone presenting a prescription for a particular type of appliance and the chemist saying, "I am sorry but this is not on the list that I am permitted to dispense." Would he actually be precluded from dispensing it? I hope not, but it is important that we should be clear about the exact thinking behind this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This discussion centres around whether it is all or none, or whether a selective approach is desirable. As far as I can judge, both the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and my honourable Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) are concerned about the approach. I am grateful to the honourable Member for Wrexham for having tabled the amendment as it has revealed a matter that requires further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
The honourable Gentleman said that he did not intend to press the amendment as it would place an unnecessary restriction upon the FPCs whereby, if applicants wished to provide three different types of services, they could grant the application only if all three types of services were "necessary or desirable". If only two services were required, the FPC could not accept the application in respect of those two services only, so if all the services were not "necessary or desirable", the application would be turned down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's wording at the moment might well be read in the reverse direction—that the FPC would, when the application was for services only some of which were necessary, have to grant the application for those services which were not necessary, so it would be granting the application for all the services even though the local circumstances required only some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would probably be common ground that the FPC should have the right to make an appropriate judgment. Therefore, if the amendment is not pressed, I give a clear undertaking that I shall consider the matter again and, I hope, come forward with an amendment on Report to make the discretion of the FPC to be selective clear in primary legislation, so that an application would be granted for those services which were required locally— obviously the other conditions must also apply. I give that undertaking to the Committee and hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to probe the Government's position on the family practitioner committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
defining "the neighbourhood" in geographical terms when deciding whether it is "necessary or desirable" to grant an application for inclusion in the pharmaceutical list which will benefit a particular neighbourhood. The amendments define "neighbourhood" as being
	<br><blockquote><p>"the area defined by a radius from the premises of one kilometre in urban areas and of two kilometres in rural areas."</p></blockquote>
We understand from other sources and from discussions that have taken place between officials of the DHSS and representatives of the pharmaceutical profession and other pharmaceutical bodies that the Government have in mind a radius, or distance limit, of 2km, to use a magic phrase, as the crow flies. To the best of my knowledge, few crows attend pharmacies to collect prescribed drugs; it tends to be done by human beings, and very few of those can fly. We therefore need to take care, either in the Bill or the regulations, when defining geographical limits. I hope that the Minister can tell us that what is proposed will be sensitive to the needs of human beings trying to get to pharmacists for the drugs that they need. In the nature of things, such people tend to be sick, in one way or another, and usually old, and many will find it difficult to get about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have consistently said, as they did on Second Reading, that they accept the Government's intention to seek to cease encouraging by public subsidy the proliferation of chemist shops in certain geographical locations. It might almost be described as the Holborn and St. Pancras syndrome, because I have, I am sure, a record number of pharmacies in one or two of the streets in my constituency. I do not believe that they are doing much good for anyone, except possibly for the profits of their shareholders. I accept the merit of the Government's proposals that there does not seem much point in giving pharmacists in effect, a public subsidy to encourage them to set up business if they will set them up, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many parts of the country—not just rural areas—where there are not many pharmacies, and companies making more money from selling plastic and furry guardsmen to tourists than from prescribed drugs. That does not happen in Hackney, Southwark or in some run-down areas. So we must be careful to ensure that the reasonable intentions of the Government do not damage the provision of pharmaceutical services in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many parts of the country, 2km is quite a long way for some people. It is from here to St. Paul's, which is a fair stride for a person in his 70s who wants to obtain a drug to ease a pain in his leg. Therefore, I have doubts about a hard and fast geographical limit, whether under the Bill or in the regulations. Considerable sensitivity would be needed about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who grew up in a rural area and now represents an innermost inner-city constituency, I can make distinctions between those areas. For example, there are parts of London in which a walk of a specific distance is considerably more dangerous and difficult than in many rural areas. A distance of 1km could involve crossing several nasty main roads and passing through areas which had a higher crime rate towards individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Therefore, a universal distance for either urban or rural areas cannot be justified, especially if it is determined on the as-the-crow-flies basis. For instance, that basis does not determine the limits beyond which children are provided with school transport. That is decided by working out the shortest reasonable route that a child would take travelling to and from school. So, whatever distance limits are set, they should be determined by such a basis and not as-the-crow-flies. Last week, I was in Glasgow—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a good speech, Frank.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my honourable Friend. A pharmacy could be within 2km or even 1km, but it might happen to be on the other side of the Clyde and sited where there was no bridge near it. That would be an absurd application of the definition. Similarly, in some rural areas a person would have to travel five or six miles to reach a pharmacy if he went by a route that a normal person could negotiate, but, as the crow flies, it would be half a mile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that we have misunderstood the matter, but we have not seen the draft regulations and we only know at second hand of the discussions with the pharmaceutical representatives. We understand that a set distance limit on an as-the-crow-flies basis is intended. We find that unsatisfactory, but if that is the Government's intention, we hope that the Minister will be prepared to consider another reasonable approach to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why some honourable Members representing pharmacists would like to see a specific figure, either in the Bill or in the regulations. They would know where they stood, and people wanting to open up new pharmacies could see from a map what their chances were. However, for some of the reasons touched on by the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), I should need to be convinced of the argument for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Minister was kind enough to supply us with a copy of the guidance which might form the basis of the regulations. I was attracted to paragraph 3, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no hard and fast rules for formulae for determining the number and distribution of pharmacies supplying NHS services. FPCs are recommended not to adopt norms, quotas or national average figures as an absolute guide nor to establish fixed rules as to, say, distance from another pharmacy. Rather, the decision on any particular application will depend on an assessment of a number of different factors in conjunction."</p></blockquote>
That seems an entirely sensible and logical approach. The whole object of the operation is to set up local FPC committees. They will know the local circumstances—and the difference between a straight line and a curved one. They will know the conditions in which it is appropriate to site a pharmacy in a given place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the paragraph to which I referred contrasts with that about the essential small pharmacies payments scheme, which lays down quite specifically that the particular pharmacy is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
less than 2km in a straight line from the next nearest pharmacy. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are the only qualifying criteria and there are no exceptions."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a far more rigid approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some South Wales Valleys could be less than 2km apart, but to travel from one valley to another might involve a journey of 20km. I wonder whether the Government have really thought that problem through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sims</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that there are quite a few crows in the valleys. However, my point is that there seems to be a conflict between the two criteria which I quoted. The first criterion seems to leave a great deal of flexibility to the FPCs and that approach appeals to me. Whether it appears in the Bill or in the regulations, I hope that my right honourable Friend will take into account our discussions in Committee. If it is decided to lay down a distance criterion in the regulations, I am sure that my constituents and those of the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) are likely to be slightly flummoxed by kilometres. Please, will the Minister use miles in the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong our debate unnecessarily, as the Minister may be able to clear up all our doubts. On Second Reading, I said that the most dramatic contrast between two constituencies must be between that of the honourable Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and my constituency of Ross, Cromarty and Skye. The point is well taken. As all manner of communities lie between those two extremes, it is sensible and highly desirable to have as much local flexibility as possible. Indeed, it is perhaps the only way to obtain effective and workable regulations that are comprehensible to those trying to operate or apply them as well as making some sense to those who will make applications in the hope of coming within the ambit of the regulations. I believe that it is the only way to achieve such sensible working arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could speculate for ever, but I suspect that the Minister will give us the news. I hope only that the news is sensible and that he will bear our anxiety in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes, when towns expand to create new suburbs, some of the planning and the building involved fill me with dismay. Often, the developers build as many houses as possible that will command a price in the commercial market but leave no space for commercial buildings or services that cost money to the developers. Frequently, there are few community service or commercial buildings. I have seen many estates consisting almost completely of houses for sale or rent where the service buildings have a much lower priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister whether there is consultation between family planning committees and planning authorities about the provision of pharmaceutical services when new suburbs are being created. What discussion takes place before
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
such areas are planned and built? Is there comprehensive discussion about the supply of pharmaceutical services? Usually, when there is urban sprawl, services are left behind. If the amendment would help to rectify matters, I for one should be pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the amendment was proposed in the manner in which it was because I have agreed with almost all that has been said in this short debate. For those who do not understand the simple clarity of our parliamentary procedure, may I explain that, as I understand it, the amendment, which seeks to impose a rigid limit, was tabled to obtain an assurance that no rigid limit would be imposed. I am glad to give such an assurance. We shall follow the flexible and sensible guidance that has been suggested and we shall abhor the rigidity of a limit, especially one that a crow is alleged to have flown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these elegant simplicities! Are they being used for the sake of not being repetitious? Does the Minister mean that he would contemplate that for the definition of the boundaries for essential local pharmacies, too? If so, we can avoid innumerable debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it is in the guidance. In considering an application for a new pharmacy, a family practitioner committee will not be bound by the rigidity about distance that would be imposed by the amendment. The committee should take into account such matters as the acceptable travelling distance and the type of terrain. A distance considered excessive in one environment might be ordinary and natural in another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft guidance that was circulated indicates that that would be done in a flexible and sensible manner. I can assure the Committee that, this being draft guidance, it will take into account the points made in this debate and also any other representations that are received before it is sent out to the family practitioner committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 	<b>4</b>, line 	<b>18</b>, leave out 'and'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 24, in page 4, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>'(e)</i> all persons providing drugs, medicines or appliances as defined by this Act prior to the establishment of the list for the particular locality in which the provision is made shall be included on that list.'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 31, in page 	<b>5,</b> line 	<b>41,</b> leave out 'and'</p>
	<p>No. 32, in page 	<b>5,</b> line 	<b>43,</b> at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(e)</i> all persons providing drugs, medicines or appliances as defined by this Act prior to the establishment of the list for the particular locality in which the provision is made shall be included on that list.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment merely seeks to strike out the word "and" from line 18 on page 4 of the Bill. If the Government accept the amendment, they will probably have to say that clause 2(2) 	<i>(d)</i> which follows will have to be similarly altered to read,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prescribed body mentioned in Clause 2(2) 	<i>(c)</i> may give its approval subject to conditions."</p></blockquote>
However, the important amendment is No. 24, and that seeks to add paragraph 	<i>(e)</i> after line 20 on page 4. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all persons providing drugs, medicines or appliances as denned by this Act prior to the establishment of the list for the particular locality in which the provision is made shall be included on that list."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is sensible because in any area the public and the family practitioner committee in England and Wales—in Scotland the health board— will want a list of all pharmacies. They will have such a list but not all the details of applications, and will not necessarily know what services are provided. If the application follows the lines of the regulations produced but not issued, quite a lot of detail has to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that because it is important to help the public, and not only the administrators. I hope that these applications will be available to the public and that a positive incentive will be given to publicise them so that people know what is available at which pharmacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is enacted, I understand that that information will not be available. No doubt, previously, anyone who wanted to open a pharmacy simply applied and the application was granted immediately. I know that certain information was required, but there was no question of not granting an application. Therefore, I suspect there was a tendency not to ask for too much information. However, the position will now change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a deprived area in which it was deemed that there were already sufficient pharmacists. Applications would be made and the relevant committee would decide whether to grant them. If the committee is to have a real choice about whether to grant an application, it must have full information. Its decision will affect not only the public but the livelihood of the applicant, who may believe that there is a demand for his services in the area, so the committee must have information about all the existing pharmacies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks to provide that information in standard form to help the committee.
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
It may even be able to borrow or inspect the books of neighbouring areas to determine whether they are acting in the same way as other committees, or whether it is being too harsh or lax in interpreting the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such information is unavailable, there will be disparity in provision of such services in different areas. There should be a single set of standards throughout the United Kingdom. I know that we have sparsely and densely populated areas for which allowance must be made, but there should be a way of allowing committees to inspect what happens in other parts of the country as a continuing part of their work. Perhaps they could meet once a year to find out what happens in different counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how the Minister can oppose our amendment. It would be good administration if information were kept uniformly so that all future applications could be judged against their peers. I apologise for the short time available, but it would be useful if the Minister could attempt to reply before the Committee adjourns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that, in one minute, I shall be unable to respond fully to the honourable Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the honourable Gentleman's objective that maximum information should be available, but I understand that that is laid down in existing regulations, so there is no need for primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the effect of the amendment would go rather wider than that. I accept the principle, but it is not necessary for current contract holders. The necessary or desirable test would apply to new applications only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
