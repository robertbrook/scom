</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment takes us to one of the Bill's central issues. It may help the Committee and the Minister if I repeat what I said on earlier amendments. The amendment carries no implication that we are unhappy with the broad structure and principles of the Bill or with the broad balance struck between statutory rules and self-regulation. I hope that my remarks on the amendment will be seen in the context that we approve the notion of a statutory framework within which a substantial degree of self-regulation is permitted and, indeed, encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Bill is not clear about who will run the body of statutory rules. The Bill is curiously drafted in that respect and is surprisingly coy about who will do the job. Not until clause 96 is a hint of an answer offered and even then it is in rather elliptical language. Clause 96 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Secretary of State—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) that a body corporate has been established"</p></blockquote>
he may make a designation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere in the Bill do the words "Securities and Investments Board" appear, which is a curious piece of drafting. It leaves a gaping hole at the heart of the Bill. It is unnecessarily devious to fail to identify what body is contemplated to exercise the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
We have ended up in a curious state, with all the paraphernalia and most of the reality of statutory regulation but no statutory body to undertake responsibility. The reason is that when the Bill was drafted and its shape was being decided, the Government simply lacked the courage of their conviction. The Government's courage failed them. They knew perfectly well that what was required was a straightforward system of statutory principles to be run in a straightforward way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always feel obliged to make it clear, lest hon. Members do not understand me, that, as established in the Bill, the statutory framework should contain the role for self-regulation with which we are all familiar. However, at the apex of the pyramid surely there should be a clear-cut body identified in statute with its powers and composition defined by statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, that as with Professor Gowers's report, it was feared that if that recommendation were put forward, the City would not wear it and that, if the City's acceptance of the proposal was prejudiced, the Bill might be jeopardised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly enough—or perhaps not—City opinion has moved ahead faster than was foreseen. City opinion has largely outstripped the Government's rather pusillanimous view in the Bill. There is probably a majority opinion in the City, at least within the younger, more progressive elements, that a clear-cut statutory body is desirable or, at the very least, inevitable. That majority opinion, which is growing all the time, comes from some surprising people. Unlikely bedfellows such as Ian Posgate and Sir John Nott show how wide is the range of opinion, in favour, for varying reasons perhaps, of a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that opinion is correct. The pace of change in the City is frantic, the changes are unpredictable, the old safeguards are being swept away, the market place which is the City has altered, and, more than ever before, we shall need clarity and certainty in the way that the City is regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, that is largely why the Bill is before us. The Government are to be commended for bringing it forward, and, as we have often made clear, in broad terms we support it. But the purpose of the Bill is to lay down for the City, in difficult and unpredictable circumstances, a clear and effective system of regulation, and if that is our objective, at the heart of the structure there should be a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been looking at foreign models, and I find that they encourage that view. I have never thought in terms of the Securities and Exchange Commission as others have, partly because I think that it has a bad reputation. That may be undeserved and in recent years it has operated more acceptably than when it was first set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the choice is between an SEC and a voluntary body, the City might be tempted to go for the latter. But that is not the option: a body with statutory identity need not be an SEC in every respect. There are more acceptable and workable models available under other jurisdictions. Virtually every other important capital market has a statutory commission of some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
kind. Two of the better examples are the Ontario Securities Commission and the National Companies and Securities Commission of Australia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the good offices of the stock exchange, I have obtained details of how those bodies operate, and they appear to be admirable models. The chairman of the Australian body, having described the way that his commission operates, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This has resulted in a regulatory system which is largely satisfactory to both the exchanges and the Commission."</p></blockquote>
A similar view is given on the Ontario commission. Therefore, the notion of a statutory commission is not only well established but well accepted in almost every other jurisdiction faced with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee by whom, and in what terms the same point was made about the Ontario commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot guarantee that I can find the exact phrase in this letter which comes from the chairman of the Toronto stock exchange, but I shall pass a copy of the letter to the Minister if he wishes to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have established that in other jurisdictions a statutory commission is acceptable and works well. Therefore, does it matter whether we have one? I believe that it does because if we do not, we shall face the over-complicated business of creating the powers, vesting them in the hands of the Secretary of State, delegating them on certain conditions, making provision for taking them back and so on. A voluntary body would, therefore, operate at one step removed from the creation of the powers in the statute. That is the first unnecessary complication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there are more serious problems. Although everyone understands the point, it is worth repeating to show how odd it is. The Securities and Investments Board, which is now a private company limited by guarantee, and will remain so, will exercise those powers. It is odd that that body, having received delegated powers, should be able to make rules with legislative effect. That has emerged in the questions of my hon. Friend the member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), and on other occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That power will be, to some extent, unfettered when the designating order is made. The Minister may withdraw designation, or dismiss members of the council, but, after designation, that private company, limited by guarantee, will have a fair degree of independence in making rules of legislative effect. Provisions in schedule 7 require it to give notice of its intentions, but those who see themselves as potentially subject to those rules are anxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) has tabled an amendment, drafted by the stock exchange, requiring SIB, when making such rules, to consult those who may be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows the element of unease about the unusual principle that an ability to make rules with legal effect should be placed in private hands. I say unusual rather than unique, but there are few other such examples, so perhaps the Minister will draw our attention to them if he wishes to claim that the position is not as unusual as it appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The peculiarities rest not so much with the proposed structure—the ability to make rules, for example—but with those issues inhibited by the peculiar structure. In normal circumstances, some aspects of the operation of SIB would have been regarded as straightforward and almost axiomatic, but, because of the peculiar position of a private body exercising those powers, the Government have not included them in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had, for example, an interesting debate on whether SIB should have the power to impose changes in the rules of SROs. The Bill was drafted as it was because it looked odd to give to one voluntary body the power to impose rule changes on other voluntary bodies. That weakness in the relationship explains many of the Bill's provisions and weaknesses. The Committee said, rightly, "No. If that regulation is to be effective, SIB must have those powers." The Minister eventually acceded to that reasoning, and we look forward to seeing his proposals in that respect. We encountered that problem, and needed the debate, because the relationship between a voluntary body and other voluntary bodies regulated by it is an odd one and leads us into difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) raised another aspect of a similar problem, concerning SIB's powers to investigate SROs and other authorised people. He drew attention to a limitation built into the Bill on that power of investigation, and, again, we can see why it is there—it is odd to give one voluntary body the power to investigate the activities of others. If SIB were idenditifed in the statute, no one would have thought further about it, as it would have been a normal aspect of the operations of a regulatory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the more controversial question of the power of SIB to initiate prosecutions. Such power does not currently exist and I do not necessarily think that it should. I suspect that our debate has again been inhibited because SIB is not a statutory body. It is in a different position from the Bank of England which has the power to initiate prosecutions—with the DPP, in many cases—under the Banking Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were serious about running the City as effectively as the Bank of England is supposed to run the banking system we would not be so hesitant. But because the Government have chosen this curious solution, matters are becoming unnecessarily snarled up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leitmotiv running through our debates has been the problem of the relationship between SIB and the SROs. How can SIB regulate the SROs effectively? We come up against the problem so often because it is very difficult to allow one bunch of chaps—that is what they are; a bunch of chaps on whom the Secretary of State's eye happens to fall—to exercise the power of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
effective regulation over the SROs. Indeed, some of my hon. Friends and I could set ourselves up as a body corporate. We could say to the Minister, "How about us? We are a likely-looking bunch. We could do the job." But that body, if it were private and voluntary, would face the same regulatory problems as SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other—not unimportant—matters, such as SIB's accountability to Parliament. The provisions for that accountability would flow more naturally if SIB were set up under the statute and had to make to Parliament reports which would be open to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of how to fit a body like the Takeover Panel into the structure of the Bill. The panel is not mentioned, but in the light of recent developments, perhaps we should consider whether it should be brought within the Bill's scope. That could be done only on a statutory basis. But how could we make the Takeover Panel a part of the Bill's statutory identity, and how could we define its relationship to a non-statutory body which is supposed to have an overall supervisory function?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financing dichotomy is not as clear cut as the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) suggested. As a voluntary body, SIB has to be financed through fee income. It would be sensible for the Government to say, "Here is a body that is entrusted with statutory functions. It needs resources. We shall provide those resources, but let us give it the power to charge fees to cover its costs." Although that might not make much practical difference, SIB could not then be accused of having its level of activity determined by the fees charged to those whom it would be regulating. Under a proper system of financing, SIB's level of activity would be determined by its appreciation of what was required and it would have the power to fix its fees and cover expenses incurred by and agreed level of activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one argument for keeping SIB as a voluntary body and that has been put forcefully by those involved in the organisation at present. While they recognise the strength of many of my arguments, which I hope will have weighed also with some Conservative Members, their major worry is that if SIB is to be made a statutory body in any shape or form and, as a consequence, is to be financed at least in principle from the public sector even though it involves no net cost to the Exchequer, it would become subject to Treasury control and would always be in the list of those bodies that had to be cut back when the Treasury axe was wielded and so, in the end, would not have the resources to do the job that is necessary. For example, it could not pay the salaries that now, perhaps, it has to pay, given the outrageous salaries in the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument, but it is a shocking indictment of our system of government that what is, on all other counts, a sensible and straightforward way of proceeding is to be frustrated and inhibited by this ridiculous argument which could be resolved at the stroke of a pen. In saying that, I am quoting one of the Minister's right hon. Friends who made that point on the Floor of the House a week or so ago in relation to the water boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
hon. Friend accept that during our discussions with representatives of the SIB that problem seemed to be the only difficulty? If we could overcome it it is likely that the SIB would support some statutory arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I do not think that we are misrepresenting opinion within the SIB when we say that that appeared to be the one objection. If that objection could be overcome—it is well within the Government's power to overcome it—I think that SIB would accept the logic of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with care to the points made and I agree with many of them. I, too, have had discussions with the SIB on the matter and although hon. Members have correctly identified its chief problem, it is also worried that were it to become a statutory body on the lines that the hon. Gentleman suggests, it would be brought within the ambit of the Treasury the Government and the Civil Service, and would be subject to all that paraphernalia. That is what makes members of SIB, and Sir Kenneth Berrill particularly, fear that it will put the dead hand of government upon the institution, which needs to be nimble, flexible and fleet of foot and attract the right people. Sir Kenneth's worry is that such paraphernalia hanging round the SIB's neck will inhibit that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stray a stage further, Sir Michael, to take up the question of funding, which the Minister touched on. Of course there could be a nil cost to the Treasury if it was simply a question of providing funds from public money and recovering that. But I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that even Conservative Members may feel that the salaries being paid to members of the SIB were wildly exorbitant, as we know that some salaries in the City are today. They might use the instrument of the government's funding, whatrever the cost implications, to hold them at a level that they and perhaps members of my own party, felt was more appropriate, and so inhibit the capacity to get the right people to do the right job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair comment. It is inevitable that any institution set up to undertake any form of public purpose is rightly always at the mercy of the political views of the Government. We live with that situation, but it is not an argument in every case for failing to do now what is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the point about civil servants. When Professor Gower wrote part I of his report, he asked whether this area should be regulated by civil servants or by a self-standing commission. That was the choice. At that point I did believe that civil servants were the right people for the job and I remain of that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. member for Yeovil because I want to make it clear that I am talking about a commission whose independence of both the City and the Government is as well-established as possible in the Bill. With all respect to the civil servants present, we are not talking about a branch of the DTI. They do a perfectly good job as civil servants, but they are not adequately equipped by training or experience to regulate the City in the way that we would want an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
independent and self-standing commission to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill involves a hard practical operation, setting in place real powers, but there is also an element of presentations and psychology. If the legislation is to work, we must convince those who deal in City markets and institutions that we mean business. We shall give the wrong impression to all those contemplating coming to London or continuing to trade in London if we put in place a great structure of regulation with, at its heart, a private company that is indistinguishable from any other pirate company and which does not even appear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people from other countries, who will be increasingly important in the City of tomorrow, will fail to understand our intention and will receive the wrong message. They will believe that the Bill contains a clear indication that the Government and the City of London are not serious about effective regulation. That would be most unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been better to set up in the early clauses a securities and investments board not very different from the one already planned. It would at least have appeared in the Bill so that its powers could be defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is very much a second best and would not solve the problem. I accept fully that the peculiarity of the structure would remain even if the amendment were accepted. But if the amendment were accepted we should least achieve the identity of the SIB within the Act. The damaging question, "Who is to run it?" would be given a proper answer. If we leave the vacuum in the Bill we shall hopelessly prejudice the system's chances of working effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Committee owes a debt of gratitude to the the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for the compelling and moderate way in which he advanced his arguments. The atmosphere in which our debates are taking place is radically different from that in which they might have been conducted some years ago. That difference reflects not only the common desire to institute a durable system which will be respected in the City and outside, but the modus vivendi that can operate in Standing Committees. Although we discuss the Bill from different perspectives, we nevertheless find common ground. I have a preference for my own amendment, but I agree with the main import of what the hon. Member Dagenham said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remind ourselves of the history of this gorup of amendments, which are very significant and which would change the structure of the system of regulatory control. Before we advance detailed arguments for or against the amendments, we must recall that we are here principally to try to improve investor protection. The whole rationale of the new regulatory system, and of any powers employed by bodies set up under it, is principally not to ensure the better oiled and more efficient working of City institutions, but to improve investor protection. Above all, it should act as a more effective preventive medicine against ugly situations that may arise in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ugly situations in the past—which gave rise to the initial inquiry and the appointment of Professor Gower, and to successive inquiries into the scrutiny of City affairs—were horrendous. During a time of booming stock markets, when it is easy to make up uncovered situations, it is easy to believe that such scandals will not recur and people will not be defaulted in the same way. Sadly, I predict that whatever we pass in the Bill they will occur. In company law, or in this legislation, there is no way that we can ensure a watertight sytem, but we have a common obligation to do the best we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, even if they do not support my arguments, will at least appreciate my credentials. I worked for some years in the City in the investment divisions of merchant banks, and I have taken a close interest in that aspect of regulation over the past few years. I submitted evidence to Professor Gower even before his interim report was published, proposing the regulatory system that I reiterated on Second Reading and which I am trying to introduce in this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Political and technical arguments can be adduced in support of amendment No. 245, which enjoys the signatory support of some of my hon. Friends. Having made some pleasant remarks about Opposition Members, I do not wish to strike too strong a note of dissension, but I believe that the tactic displayed this morning was rather shallow and unhelpful. While signatories to any amendment are at liberty to withdraw their signatures from, not to support, or, indeed, to vote against an amendment, Conservative Members do not need the blandishments of Opposition Members, who implied that in some way our arms were being twisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that you would agree, Sir Michael, that Conservative Members have displayed exemplary independence and responsibility it their approach to a series of amendments—notable the question of the rule changes that can be imposed by the SIB. I am happy to trust their objectivity and judgment in assessing the arguments that I wish to present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that political arguments in favour of statutory recognition of the designated agency come first. To recognise the designated agency specifically and in law would send the right messages to the public. I believe that investors and the City would be reassured if they felt that that body had a place in law and was recognised, and that the legislation fulfilled what they understand to be undertakings by the Government, in successive reports, to institute a regulatory system and not a discretionary system allowing the Secretary of State to delegate this or that power to this or that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Dagenham, I believe that public opinion, City opinion and international opinion have moved markedly during the process of public discussion of this subject not only over the last two and a half years, but interestingly, quite rapidly over the last six months or so. I am sure that my hon. Friend and lady Friend the Under-Secretary—who has excellent contacts and has developed an excellent reputation in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>527</span>
short period of time in office for consulting closely with bodies in the City—will be aware that while some of them have misgivings about what I am proposing other authoritative and responsible bodies support it. They have changed their minds in its favour and none of them can be classified as people who do not support in any way the ideals of a capitalist and free system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people believe that there is a limit to what we can do in legislation by instituting a regulatory system, or laying down provisions of law. That is what I call the Stanley Clinton Davis theory of company law. He believed that, although we have a responsibility to define as closely as possible and prescribe the law, we are capable only of sending out a message about what we think is permissable, recognising the limitations of law and the sophistication of lawyers, enabling them to get round a system. A good example of that is insider dealing, because, however much we may legislate or speak against it, the practice is difficult to control. Those hon. Members who took part in the passage of the Companies Act 1980 will know what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a responsibility to draft our legislation as clearly and specifically as possible, and I am not in favour of having it made subsequently by order. My hon. Friend the Member of Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) supported the criticism that I voiced on Second Reading about the lack of detail in the legislation. We are sending a message to the City and the public to inform them or our anxieties and seriousness about instituting a system of statutory and permissive control. The recognition of the body in law would reassure professional operators in the City and provide reassurance and protection for the investing public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second political argument that I adduce in favour of my amendment is that it would enjoy political support on both sides of the House, and be more enduring than other legislation in recent years. The idea of common cause and middle ground does not necessarily appeal to everyone, but we have a responsibility to ensure that the City of London and the financial services industry remain a vital and contributory part of our economy, vibrant and prosperous, and a significant contributor to our balance of payments. Any inhibition on their ability to do so, through uncertainty about the future, or by the diversion of business to other markets, which may operate on a more fair, overt and controlled basis, would be detrimental to the City's prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it may be argued, politically and economically, that there is a strong case in favour of a statutory recognition of SIB, to ensure that we have a clear system that will attract money, give people confidence and endure the passage of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the importance of proceeding in the House, wherever possible, on a bipartisan basis of support. On such occasions, we should state our anxieties frankly. Many of my hon. Friends on the Committee and in the parliamentary Conservative party are anxious that statutory recognition of SIB might be used by a future Government, perhaps of a different political persuasion, as a Trojan horse for the institution of Securities and Exchange Commission-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
type system in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal political argument in favour of recognition is that, if we fail to institute a system of regulatory control at this stage in law, there is a danger that, at a later stage—perhaps in a few years' time, and under a Government of a different political complexion—we shall have a more draconian system of control over the City and the financial services industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are anxious about the matter, and, if we fail to seize the opportunity to institute now a system of statutory regulation, which enjoys a progressive and responsible body of opinion support in the City, there is a danger that, in very changed circumstances, with a bear market and a series of scandals, we shall have something vastly different. We may have the repeal of the Bill and total control of the City. The prospects for the City would be disastrous and we should have to hold ourselves accountable for not instituting now a system that might have prevented that eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view, and the view of many of my honourable Friends, is that we would not wish to have to legislate again. We hope that the Bill works. That is why we are so vigorous in the support of our position. We do not want to come back to the matter, but this is one problem to which we might have to return. Honourable Gentlemen should bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman bears out in his way exactly my fears. I share his desire to institute good law that will stand the test of time and, in particular, a bear market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of an analogy, I think that the House was right to extend the Lloyds' Bill against much opinion at the time in Lloyds' and the City generally. Parliament decided that it was right to move ahead slightly of City opinion. Perhaps that was inadequate; we must wait and see. But we took the initiative then and there is an analogy with the present situation. We must have the courage of our political convictions and institute in law what we say that we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further reason worth mentioning. It is at least arguable that a future Government of a different complexion could institute a system of direct control over City affairs more easily under the bill as drafted than if we embody in the legislation a statutory commission. It is possible for the Secretary of State to revoke tomorrow all the delegated powers under clause 97; he can effectively abolish the SIB tomorrow. He can take back to himself all or any of the powers. There are one or two aspirants to power on the Opposition Benches who might, if they ever had those responsibilities, be very ready to exercise that power in response to a considerable body of political and public opinion that ensued after any scandals that might occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all highly speculative. Nevertheless, we have a responsibility to be speculative, to look forward, and to cast legislation that will cover such eventualities. If we embody in law a recognition of the SIB as the regulatory body, it will be very much more difficult to take that away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
Finally on the political front, there are arguments in favour of a similar system of regulation to that adopted in other countries if international markets are to compete and to operate fairly. The honourable Member for Dagenham referred to the matter. Some time ago I visited the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago and discussed with members of the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission, its governmental statutory body, and the Mercantile Exchange, which is the self-regulating body, their relationship and modus operandi. In that highly speculative, liquid and potentially dangerous and novel area of investment they have been able to find their way forward with remarkable success, without the bureaucracy associated with the SEC, which would not apply in this country anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the present Secretary of State is much more sympathetic to arguments such as I have presented, some of his predecessors have had to be pulled towards being less alarmist and less worried about emulating an SEC in this country. That is the big fear of the Conservative party. It sees an SEC with its nine regional divisions, and 1,800 employees instituting a bureaucratic system of control such as that laid down in the Securities Act 1933 as being heinous and the last thing that we wish to emulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a situation would not arise here, as the position is entirely different. The fear also ignores the fact that growth of self-regulation in the American markets in recent years has enabled the SEC to deregulate a great deal of its control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dagenham was right to refer to the analagies in Toronto and in Ontario where the system is exemplary. The Australian and New Zealand systems also incorporate self-standing commissions which work well in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read chapter III of Professor Gower's report with particular interest. It sets out the arguments for and against the DTI having a self-standing regulatory commission. Professor Gower, whom most of us know and respect, came down in favour of such a commission, but felt that in the political atmosphere existing then— some time ago now—it was not on the cards. He said that the decision was finely balanced and that he wanted to get it right, but he could not, on balance, support such a commission. The professor felt that a statutorily recognised body would be more in touch with what was going on and could offer attractions and a career structure to able people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who heard that the Bill was being brought in believed that it would provide investors with significantly greater protection, and I believe, in many respects, that it will. I fear that unless the amen-dements are accepted, we shall fall short of many expectations outside the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to explain the technical reasons. Even if the Secretary of State is satisfied that SIB can fulfil the functions laid down for it, and he delegates all power that he can to it, the board will still not be able to investigate insider dealing; it will still not be able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
obtain information from unauthorised people in investigating their activities or those of authorised persons; it will still not be able to change certain rules on advertising by unauthorised persons; it will not be able to recognise investment or collective schemes in the European Community or other countries. The SIB investigator, inquiring into an authorised insurance and investment business and its tied salesmen, will not be able to obtain information from anyone other than an authorised person, and SIB will not be able to exercise certain powers towards insurance companies—particularly with reference to schedule 8 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be the position even if the Secretary of State devolved to SIB the maximum powers allowed under the Bill. Why is that so? Most people believe that once the system is in place, the body will be a watchdog, responsible for policing and overseeing the activities of all those in the investment field, and preventing the worst sort of activities from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one simple reason why SIB will not work like that. Apparently SIB is regarded as a private sector body, and as such cannot undertake any of the functions I have listed. Yet, as I said this morning, the Secretary of State reserves to himself a continuing responsibility for all those powers. We have therefore an absurd duplication of expertise and personnel, with people in the Department of Trade checking whether unauthorised people are carrying on investment business, whereas the SIB is responsible for investigation whether authorised investment dealers are carrying on their business satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked my hon. and learned Friend about that, he rightly referred to a later clause which will ensure that although that is technically so, in any specific instance the Secretary of State can delegate to the SIB the ability to investigate particular matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is nonsense and bad law. I realise that the intentions of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary are good, but that is not the way to institute good law. We should be passing law that is clear and respected and which will stand the test of time so that people know where they are. It is not good enough to say, "I take upon myself certain powers, but I shall delegate some of them to someone else. In another clause I shall give him the power to investigate whatever he likes."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the words of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary were, "I reassure my hon. Friend that the problem will not arise in practice." I make no complaint because my hon. and learned Friend was answering my question, but basically his reply was a denial and negation of the whole delegating procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we about? Why do we have this tortuous process of drafting? Why do we not recognise reality and legislate for the system that we intend to institute? It would be clearer, more efficacious, more highly respected and would lead to a more efficient and well-used market to do what we say that we are doing and what people think that we are doing. We should have the courage of our political convictions and institute the SIB in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>531</span>
Much can be made of the questions of fees and employment. Even if the cost of the fees fell on the public purse, that should not overpower the basic reasons of principle and fact for instituting a statutorily recognised system. However, it would be preferable if the cost of the system were borne through a process of levy on the City institutions and on bodies belonging to SRO's. I do not know whether that would give rise to some hybridity in terms of a tax on a particular group of people, but the need to overcome that problem should not inhibit us from instituting a much bigger and more important objective—a system of regulation that will stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On expertise, I have talked privately and publicly with Sir Kenneth Berrill, as many people have done. They recognise privately that the arguments on whether there should be a statutory or voluntary organisation are finely balanced and very different. Given the current underemployment of highly qualified people in the City, the body would have little difficulty in getting a substantial number of people to serve on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are compelling factors in support of what I and the hon. Member for Dagenham have proposed. I hope that my hon. Friends will prefer my amendment to that of the hon. Gentleman, because mine is more conservative. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would institute a statutory body ad initio whereas my amendment would institute the body only when the Secretary of State was satisfied that it could take on the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely my proposal is not different from what the Government want—an SIB operating efectively. I am trying to assist the Government, with what I admit is not a modest amendment, by replacing a system of dual voluntary control with a clear, more accountable and more authoritative regulatory system that would stand the test of time but which, above all, would allow a degree of self-regulation to continue. Without that, I fear not only for the SIB but for the future of self-regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has taken until today for us to get a list of those powers from Opposition Members. I apologise to you, Sir Michael, and to the Committee for the fact that it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
May take a little time, but I shall deal with each matter cited by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I shall seek to show that some of those matters are irrelevant to the question whether there should be a statutory body and that, if changes are thought to be desirable—which is not a view that I share—they could be made without involving a statutory body or commission of the sort that the hon. Member for Dagenham urged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) did not give a list of the powers that he thinks the Bill lacks or of the powers that he thinks the body should but does not have, although he did point out some curiosities of drafting—I think that that is a fair description of the way in which he put it. He said that they would have been unnecessary, if the matter had been approached, and the Bill drawn up, in a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene, but I must make it clear that I gave a long list of powers, such as the power of prosecution and investigation, that the SIB should have.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are all powers that are contemplated in the legislation, although the balance of power would be different and the designated agency would not have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to address themselves to the question of what practical difference, if any, the suggestions of my hon. Friend the Member of Chichester would make in those matters. Will significant practical disadvantages follow from the fact that the powers are allotted in a different way from that which my hon. Friend would prefer? With respect to my hon. Friend, he did not identify any such practical disadvantages, but if there were any, would they outweigh the disadvantages that I shall suggest would accrue from changing the Bill in the way that he suggests? The Committee should not think in terms of slogans or messages, but should address itself to the practical problems that would arise from such changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment that my hon. Friend has tabled and the arguments that he has advanced in favour of it would in many respects go much further than the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Dagenham. My hon. Friend recognised that his amendment would change in a fundamental and far-reaching way the structure that lies at the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come in due course to the detailed points that have been made by the hon. Member for Dagenham and by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester and shall seek to show that the changes that they advocate would not lead to any practical advantages in the system of regulation that we propose to introduce, but would lead to significant and, in some cases, substantial disadvantages. That is the balance that the Committee must address and those are the issues that the Committee must face. But before I come to those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
detailed points, I want to introduce the matter by explaining the basis of the proposed system and how it would be accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one will disagree with the proposition that the proposed body faces a difficult task. It will have to draw up rules to cover the many different problems that can arise in the wide range of investment activities covered by the Bill. Our debates on clause 45 illustrated the breadth of the rule-making power. It is important that the rules, while providing proper protection for investors, should not do so in a way that undermines UK competitiveness or drives business offshore. Devising arrangements for monitoring and enforcing the rules is no easy task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are convinced—I understand that the hon. Member for Dagenham shares this view—that if the system is to be effective it must rely to a large extent on the expertise and commitment of practitioners, particularly current practitioners. The role for practitioners arises not only at the level of the recognised bodies, but also at the level of the agency which, if powers are transferred, will have a major role in setting standards for the recognised bodies. So the agency will need to draw extensively on practitioners as well as on users and others to serve on the governing body and to staff the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question then arises: what form should that central body take? I hope to convince the Committee that the arrangements proposed in the Bill are better designed to achieve the dual objectives of effectiveness and accountability than the alternatives proposed in the amendments, and I shall start by reminding hon. Members of the key features of the arrangements proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may transfer powers to an agency only when he is satisfied that specified criteria are met. Those criteria relate, first, to the constitution of the body. Its constitution must provide for members to be appointed by, and to be removable by, the Secretary of State and the governor of the Bank of England acting jointly, and those members must include practitioners, users and others. It must have proper procedures for taking decisions. Those provisions ensure that the powers can be transferred only to a body that is properly organised and run by people who have between them the range of experience to do an effective regulatory job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the agency must have a satisfactory system for monitoring and enforcing its rules and for investigating complaints and it must be able and willing to promote and maintain high standards of integrity and fair dealing. Thirdly, rule-making powers may be transferred only if the rules that the agency proposes to make would provide adequate investor protection and comply with the principles set out in schedule 6. The Secretary of State must also be satisfied that the rules will not restrict competition to an extent greater than is necessary in the interests of investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are tough requirements, designed to ensure that powers can be transferred only to an agency that has the resources, will and ability to maintain the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
highest standards in the carrying out of investment business. The transfer order is subject ot affirmative resolution, so powers can be transferred only if Parliament, as well as the Secretary of State, is satisfied that it is right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which powers can be transferred? We shall debate the question later, but the short answer is that virtually all powers relating to authorised persons and exempt representatives, except those concerning the scope of regulation under the Bill can be transferred. The latter are reserved to the Secretary of State, and I believe that they should be reserved to him, whatever the nature of the central body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Bill enables the agency to exercise its powers flexibly and quickly, so that it can respond rapidly to changing circumstances. In addition, the Bill allows the agency to determine its own budget, free from external controls, so that it can decide what resources and staff it needs to function properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides four methods for maintaining effectiveness and accountability, after the transfer of functions. First, the Secretary of State and the governor, acting jointly, can remove the agency's chairman and board members. Secondly, if the agency fails to meet any of the requirements for the transfer of functions, the Secretary of State can withdraw powers—in whole or in part—from the agency, and can either exercise them himself, or transfer them to another agency that would do a better job. Thirdly, the Secretary of State can direct the agency to alter its rules or practices if he believes that they are unduly anti-competitive. In addition, he can intervene to ensure that the United Kingdom meets its international obligations. Fourthly, the agency is required to submit an annual report which must be laid before Parliament, and which Parliament will no doubt wish to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arrangements meet our objectives of effectiveness and accountability, but let us examine the alternatives proposed in the amendments, to see whether they meet the required standards. The hon. Member for Dagenham sought to persuade the Committee that a "statutory body"—in the sense in which he used the term—would have advangages over the proposals currently contained in the Bill. First, he suggested that the body should be able to make rules with legislative effect and that those rules should have the authority of Parliament, rather than being made by the designated agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister to avoid directing more of his speech to points that have not been made by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) or myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the rule-making capacity exists, but it sat uneasily with what was a private body, and that unease was felt widely, not least by the stock exchange and others who found themselves subject to those rules. I am sure that the Minister has seen letters to that effect in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> and elsewhere. I was trying to say that the difficulty arises because we do not have a statutory body—which would be the normal and obvious way of proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Member for Dagenham
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>535</span>
has not addressed the heart of the issue. My hon. Friend for Chichester suggested that he disliked order-making powers and wanted everything clearly written into the legislation. He wanted the rules, or a large portion of them, to be in the Bill, because they would be clear and have the force of law. However, each time those rules had to be changed, the legislation would have to be changed. That is an overwhelming disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to argue for the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). He feels that the balance between those principles and rules in primary legislation and those which inevitably are made by secondary legislation should tilt towards primary legislation. I agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a separate point. Who should exercise the power under the Bill to make rules? The hon. Member for Chichester and I both argue that those powers are more appropriately exercised by a statutory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first possibility is that the rules could be enshrined in the statute, as the hon. Member for Dagenham says, there could be a mixture; not all the rules need to be in the statute. But if the hon. Member and my hon. Friend the member for Chichester are suggesting that there should be more rules in the statute and fewer rules outside the scope of the statute, they must realise that the system would be less flexible. We should have to come back to Parliament for the authority to change any of the rules contained in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second possibility is that there could be an order-making power. That would be less onerous and would not require a change in the primary legislation. However, whether there was a statutory agency or a private sector body as proposed in the Bill, the Secretary of State would have to grant permission for a change to the rules and would have to lay the draft rules before Parliament. That regime would also be less flexible than that proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third possibility is that, so long as the rules complied with the general criteria prescribed in the legislation, they could be made and changed without referring to Parliament. The system would be flexible and changes could be made speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham said that his argument was not about whether the rules should be in primary legislation but about who should make the rules. He argued that the rule-making body should be a statutory body and not the body proposed in the Bill to which the Secretary of State's powers will be transferred. I understand that distinction, but what would be the advantages of a statutory body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help to illuminate our point if the Minister would specify the precedents for giving such a legislative, rule-making power to a private body. If, as I suspect, he cannot produce a very long list, perhaps he should conclude that there was merit in the judgment of those who refrained from giving such powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>536</span>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always intriguing when Labour Members rely on tradition for the basis of their argument. The hon. Member for Dagenham has not dealt with the point. I do not rely on precedent. I do not suggest that there are extensive precedents. The clause provides a novel structure to deal with the problems. The hon. Gentleman's argument is not advanced by identifying that fact. What are the disadvantages of such a structure? What defects does the hon. Gentleman identify?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent 15 minutes explaining that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with some of the examples that the hon. Gentleman cited. He has not allowed me to go beyond the first one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the rule-changing power which was accepted on clause 12. The question whether the designated agency should be able to intervene directly or be obliged to go to a court for a compliance order is finely balanced. I said that I would listen to the views of others constructively and with an open mind. It was clear that there was a substantial, even overwhelming, body of opinion in favour of giving the agency a direct rule-making power. We accept that in principle. However, I do not understand how that decision on clause 12 advances the hon. Gentleman's argument that there ought to be a different statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's example was the power to investigate. I think that he had in mind the fact that the designated agency's power was limited to investigating authorised persons, whereas the power to investigate non-authorised persons will remain with the Secretary of State. That raises no practical problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester asked why we used the circuitous process of enabling the Secretary of State to delegate the power to investigate to the agency's officers. The answer is that we felt it appropriate that the agency should have a direct involvement with authorised persons, but not with non-authorised persons. There are no practical differences, so that is not a powerful argument for having a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham concerned the power to initiate prosecutions. If a body is to be entrusted with such a power, that body should have expertise and experience in prosecutions. The Secretary of State has responsibility for prosecutions. Personnel at the Department of Trade and Industry have expertise and experience in deciding whether prosecutions should be instituted. They are familiar with admissibility of evidence, the burden of proof in criminal courts, and the need to adduce evidence which would satisfy a jury. The designated agency will not be concerned with criminal prosecutions. Therefore, it will not need people with such expertise and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham also referred to the balance between the designated agency and the self-regulating organisations. I agree that the precise balance between those two limbs of the regulatory system is important and fundamental. Different

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
people have different views on where that balance should lie. However, we can do our best to strike the right balance whether or not the designated agency is a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Takeover Panel and whether it should be in the Bill. There may be arguments for including it in the Bill, which must be considered, but that has nothing to do with whether the designated agency is to be a statutory body. The question of whether it is appropriate for the Takeover Panel to be within the regulatory system is a different issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of the Minister's argument appears to be that it would be possible, within the Bill, to give the securities and investments board, as a private company, the powers which the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and I mentioned. That is true. We could do anything in the Bill. We could give the powers to Caligula's horse if we wished. Our argument is that if we were to compel the Minister—as in the change of rules power—to do that, we would be getting further away from the appropriate role of a private body. That is a matter of judgment rather than logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been going through the examples cited by the hon. Gentleman to show that whatever view is taken on each of those matters, they do not require that the designated agency should be a statutory body. We believe that there would be substantial disadvantages in introducing a statutory element into the designated agency. The hon. Gentleman has recognised those disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important and fundamental disadvantage involves resources. We want the designated agency to have the necessary resources to carry out the job effectively. It would be in a better position to obtain those resources if it were not a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham gave examples from other countries which were espoused with some enthusiasm by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. My research reveals that the examples given—the National Companies and Securities Commission in Australia and the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada—were subject to financial constraints imposed by their respective governmental sponsors. There have been budgetary constraints on manpower and income in both those countries, and planned increases in registration fees—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If Opposition Members want a body that will work I should have thought that they would be interested in whether it will have enough resources to enable it to work. The experiences of other countries suggest that making an organisation a public sector statutory body imposes resources constraints which inhibit it from doing its job properly. There have been such constraints in both Australia and Canada, and a planned increase in registration fees in Canada was recently cut on the orders of the lieutenant governor of Ontario.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those disadvantages must be faced. They cannot be wished away. A recent report from the Australian Government, reviewing its own commission, quotes extensively from the White Paper produced in Britain
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
a year ago, and makes proposals for modifying the arrangements in Australia to introduce the provisions in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a key point. I do not see why a statutory recognised body of the sort being proposed by the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) would necessarily mean state funding. If precedent is followed—and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has extolled the virtues of establishing precedents—would it not be better for him to establish a new precedent so that he could allow funding to be drawn from within the organisation rather than from the state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that members of the Committee will approach the matter realistically. Whatever the theory of the matter they know that in practice resource constraints always have an impact on public sector statutory bodies. Any Government faced with the question of how much should be paid to members of the governing body of the statutory designated agency— or of the self-regulating organisations if they were brought within the statutory ambit as well— would have to make comparisons between the amount of money devoted to the salaries of membes of that body and the salaries paid elsewhere in the public sector. We all know that that would lead to constraints which would inhibit our ability to find the right people with the right practitioner experience in the industry to perform the necessary functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell me why statutory recognition would necessarily mean state funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on what the hon. Gentleman means by statutory recognition. That is the difficulty and is the reason why I invited the Committee not to think in terms of slogans but of the reality of the problems that we must face and the solutions to them. It is of course possible for the only statutory element of the body to be its identification by name in the legislation. One could limit oneself to that minimalist statutory element and the regime could otherwise be left the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester proposes. He favours a fundamental change with a number of the rules enshrined in the statute, because he does not like legislation by order-making power. If the agency is merely mentioned in the statute, while its powers and rule-making function are left the same as the legislation currently proposes, that may not lead to any dramatic change. But the more that we move away from that simple change and introduce additional elements of statutory force into the regime, by giving the body statutory powers, and insisting on its rule-making power being subject to statute, the further away we shall move from the present concept. And if we make the body more like a public agency—as we understand the term—the resource constraints will apply to a greater extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider precisely what powers it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>539</span>
proposed to give such a body if we are sensibly to assess the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another serious disadvantage of a statutory commission—even a commission with exactly the same powers and functions as those proposed for an agency—is the question of accountability. The amendment proposes a once-for-all transfer of the powers in the Bill to a designated agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most certainly not so. However, I have a later amendment to delete clause 97. If that amendment were to be accepted—I have no great hopes of that, but I think that it is worth debating—it would mean that once the delegation had been given, it could not be revoked. But this amendment certainly does not propose a once-for-all transfer of the powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. However, I am endeavouring to understand what lies behind my hon. Friend's amendment, and how he would like to replace the present system. It is important to know his view on other powers, as well as his other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have a body in which the powers were to be transferred on a once-for-all basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what is suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that shortly. If, as I said, we have a body in which the powers were to be transferred on a once-for-all basis, we would lose the advantage of accountability. If the powers were given to the body by statute, they could be taken away only by statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that my hon. Friend will be unsuccessful in having his later amendments accepted, and that he is partially successful only in making the body statutory. Amendment No. 245 would enable the Secretary of State to transfer the powers only to the Securities and Investment Board, which would be identified in the Bill. Therefore further legislation would be required if the Secretary of State were to decide later—as was at one time proposed in relation to the present regime—that there would be advantages in proposing transferring some of the powers to one body, and other powers to a different body, just as it was originally contemplated that some powers might be transferred to the Securities and Investment Board and others to the Marketing of Investments Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that would be a serious disadvantage and would reduce the flexibility that should be seen as one of the principal advantages and one of the most desirable features of the proposed regime. I also ask my hon. Friends in particular to bear in mind the reduced Parliamentary accountability that would result from a separate agency being identified and designated once and for all in the legislation. The Secretary of State, having transferred his powers, would not be accountable to Parliament in the various ways that I have identified. The agency would not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, as it would be under the Bill's regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are substantial disadvantages and I am entitled to ask what advantages are worth paying that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>540</span>
price. That is why I suggest that the benefits that have been referred to could be achieved in some other way. The powers could be given to the designated agency without incurring those disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to show that there are no practical disadvantages in the system that the Bill proposes, and any change in that system would not provide any practical advantages. The changes would not achieve anything that would be worth the sacrifice of the advantages that I have drawn to the attention of the Committee. Therefore, I invite the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee. I pay tribute to the comprehensive and powerful arguments put by the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). I am afraid that I cannot say the same about the Minister's speech—the best I can say is that I am glad I did not have to make it, because it was a very difficult speech to make. There is an old saying which I call "the sausage principle": those who love sausages and respect the law should take great care to be sure that they never watch either being made. I suspect that those who listened to the Minister and who read 	<i>Hansard</i> afterwards may remember that saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that the amendments are textually perfect, and perhaps they could be improved, although I have no suggestions about how to do that. But I support the amendments—or at least the sense of them. The Minister's case based on the ideal that there was no particular advantage to the amendments in terms of rules or investigations. Even if we grant him that—and I suspect that many would not—I see three compelling reasons for having a statutory recognised body as the amendments suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason is connected with what the Minister said about where the balance lies, which has been the subject of much of the debate. The balance needs to lie on a stronger, and more positively determined structure that the present one. That is, it should be statutory recognised, as the amendments suggest. If the amendments do nothing else—and I believe that they do other things—they provide a sense of public recognition of the importance and accountability of the SIB. The Bill has put the balance in the wrong place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) made a key point about the permanence of the institution provided for under the Bill. If it were recognised in statute it would be more difficult for it to be interfered with in future. The Minister should regard that—as I am sure will other Conservative Members— as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, a less important, but nevertheless significant point is that an agency should be able to operate internationally on a like-with-like basis. I the structure is supposed to enable us to operate more effectively in the international markets, that would be a powerful point in its favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not convinced me—or, I suspect, anyone else—that there is an ineluctable connection between statutory recognition and state funding. If he had, I should have taken a different view. Under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>541</span>
proposal, an SIB could continue to be funded from the City which it regulates. That is not quite good enough; I wish to see that strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained—and do not wish to expand on it—why I cannot go as far as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) or the Labour Party would wish, in seeking to ensure that the organisation is state funded. However, when considering resources, it will be important to allow the Secretary of State the reserve power to intervene in the funding of the SIB to increase resources if he believes that they are too small. That was why I interrupted the Minister's speech on the previous clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the City wished to limit the resources that it supplied to the SIB in order to weaken the board, the Minister should retain a reserve power to ensure that resources can be increased. Clause 95(1) seems to provide for that, and to ensure an element of accountability and control over the funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to receive an assurance from the Minister that it would be up to him to decide whether to delegate all or only some of his power to prescribe. I understood from his answer that he could delegate some of it and retain a reserve power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are misconceived and would not produce the outcome that we all want, which is the highest standard of investor protection. I appreciate the political—or presentational—concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), which I believe we all share, that a designated agency should be shown to be strong. My hon. Friend believes that if the SIB is specified as the designated agency under the terms of the legislation, its authority will be enhanced. The SIB should have great authority, but I do not share the view that we must nominate the SIB in that way to achieve such authority. If we followed the course advocated in the amendments there would be substantial disadvantages which would partly outweigh any presentational gain that there might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Minister has given an exhaustive, magisterial account of the arguments against the amendments. It the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) reads the Minister's speech in 	<i>Hansard</i> he will recognise the Minister's arguments were very powerful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to mention only two points. The Minister has dealt with them, but I wish to underline their importance. First, it is essential that the Government should reserve the discretion to withdraw designation from a body in circumstances—obviously not immediately foreseeable—in which it may be inappropriate for the powers to remain delegated to that body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in clause 97.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we specify in the legislation that the agency to which the powers are designated must be an agency called the Securities and Investments Board, it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>542</span>
will be difficult for the Government to withdraw powers from that board only to return them to it. That is the position in which the Government would find themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want Committee members to labour under a misapprehension about that. My amendment makes it clear that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the body, recognised in law, can do the job before he transfers the powers to it. But, under clause 97, he may revoke the designation and take it upon himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, my hon. Friend has not understood my point. It is important that the Government should be able to transfer delegated powers to another body, or perhaps two or three different bodies. Committee members agree that, in the circumstances of 1985–86, it was not appropriate to have two designated agencies. We welcomed the government's intention to delegate powers to the Securities and Investments Board, which would embrace MIBOC. But both sides of the Committee have agreed that they wish to establish enduring legislation, and we cannot be confident that the institutional arrangements appropriate for 1985–86 will be appropriate in five, 10, 15 or 20 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must, therefore, reserve the flexibility to delegate to a different pattern of institutions from that to which they intend to delegate now. We should not set in concrete and perpetuity arrangements that seem satisfactory and attractive at present. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that the pace of change in the financial services industry is frantic and unpredictable. That is why the Government must preserve discretion and flexibility in the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the second argument that I wish to endorse. If we nominate SIB as the designated agency, it will become a Government agency in a new sense—an extension of the Civil Service, In consequence, it will be difficult not to limit its powers and scope unduly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, pay is an important matter, as my hon. Friend the Minister said. It is not possible, on Civil Service pay scales, to attract people of adequate standing and experience in the City to start the designated agency. The hon. Member for Yeovil wanted to know whether, if we had a statutory agency of the kind that he favours, members could be paid on an appropriate market-based pay scale. Perhaps I can answer his question. The City would not be willing to pay. It would say to the Government, "You have required that the agency should be set up. These are its terms of reference. You have named the specific agency. You want it to be in being. You can require the taxpayer to foot the bill."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem. Sir Kenneth Berrill says that he does not propose to pay his staff on the scale on which Eurobond dealers are paid, but he should have the freedom to attract people of the necessary quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency became an extension of the Department of Trade and Industry, as it would if the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>543</span>
amendments were accepted, it would be subject to detailed administrative supervision. In the words of the hon. Member for Dagenham, it would become snarled up in control from Whitehall. We would move inescapably down the road to a fully statutory body in the sense that the council of the stock exchange is a fully statutory body. It would derive its powers in detail from the Government, from statute and from further Government intervention. That would happen eventually, if not immediately, and would be contrary to the fundamental strategy of the measure. The measure seeks to establish broad principles and criteria within which the agency would have to work, but recognises the enormous importance of flexibility and adaptability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are designing a scheme of practitioner-based regulation within a statutory framework, which will be infinitely preferable to a scheme in which the agency's powers are derived in detail from legislation. I believe that if the amendments were accepted we would move inevitably down that road although, as the hon. Member for Dagenham said, it is a matter of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency's powers have been made strong enough to enable it to impose rules on SROs. I note that Sir Kenneth Berrill accepts that he does not need the powers to initiate prosecutions which were mentioned earlier. He believes that he will have enough powers on prosecutions by working closely with other authorities and with the strengthened provisions for the prevention of fraud. He believes that, because of the agency's powers of authorisation and its ability to satisfy itself that the rules of SROs are stringent and adequate, his powers will be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I part company with Opposition Members who see demerit in the fact that the measure is constitutionally innovative. It will meet a new situation and is well judged to do so. It may be a matter of political tempra-ment, but I see such innovation as a positive attraction. A voluntary body working in conjunction with other voluntary bodies to achieve a satisfactory scheme of regulation—no one supposes that the SIB will be a soft touch—will be greatly preferable to the highly bureaucratised and legalistic scheme that would flow from the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) on a most eloquent and persuasive speech. He has been a consistent advocate of this cause for a number of years and has never wavered from the belief that it was the right course. Most members of the Committee find his speech extremely convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary because he inherited the issue in September last year and the White Paper was published in January. The history of the Bill is significant because for four years the debate was not about whether there should be a private or a public body, but about whether there should be direct regulation from the Department or a self-standing commission. Gradually opinion started to move towards a commission, because no one liked the idea of direct regulation by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>544</span>
The Government had to make a difficult choice. They did not want regulation by the Department, but they were frightened of a commission because of the awful spectre of the SEC. In January last year, we were told for the first time that there were to be one or more private sector bodies. There was no justification for that proposal and it was conceded that it would create an unprecedented situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why my hon. and learned Friend issued a challenge—the best line of defence is attack—but we needed a defence for a proposal that had been around for only 14 months. People have been considering the alternative for much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester raised the specific question of resources and asked whether the body would become part of the Civil Service. It is a practical problem which can be overcome because we already have a model in the Audit Commission for Local Authorities, set up under the Local Government Finance Act 1982. It was established by this Government and is funded entirely from audit fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result the director can fix salaries. One reason why my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), as Secretary of State for the Environment, set up the body in the first placed was the problem of accountants' salaries. Therefore it can be done, although the Department of the Environment rather regrets having set up the commission, as it is now so independent of Government it spends half its time issuing reports criticising local government finance. It is an effective body, and offers an example we could follow here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not interested in slogans but I do think that the message that goes out from this Committee is important. All the people I have talked to, whether in the City or elsewhere, want to ensure that we create a strong and effective structure. I am sorry that in this one respect a building block is missing, because the rest of the White Paper following the Gower report achieves that structure. The amendment gives us the chance to put things right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the arguments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had a difficult speech to make. First, he cited a number of disadvantages in the purposes of the amendment. However, the disadvantages that he listed apply whenever we seek to set up a statutory body, and this situation is not so unique as to warrant totally different treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister suggested that the advantages that the amendment seeks could be achieved without setting up a statutory body. As I sought to show in my intervention, that is true and logical, but as a matter of judgment, I feel it would be totally inappropriate to pursue that course. Balance, as the Minister says, is of the essence of the issue, and my hon. Friends and I believe that the balance has not been drawn in the right place. I see advantages in my amendment over that of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). However, if the hon. Member is proposing to put his amendment to the vote—I see that

The amendment seeks to give the Securities and Investments Board power to initiate prosecutions in performing its many functions, in the same way that the Secretary of State now does under a range of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
statutory provisions. Clause 96 excludes clause 157 from the ambit of the designation and the amendment would simply restore that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the SIB to have power to prosecute. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) referred to Sir Kenneth Berrill's remark that he did not need a prosecuting power, but Sir Kenneth's renunciation of such a power was expressed in rather wistful terms and I do not believe that he would say that he did not in any circumstances want the power to initiate prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most other bodies comparable to the SIB have power to prosecute. The Bank of England, in its supervisory functions under the Banking Act 1979, has power to initiate prosecutions. The power is also exercised by many statutory bodies that fulfil that function abroad and if the SIB is to do its job properly it should have that power, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not envisage that the SIB will bring prosecutions itself in every case. In most cases of any gravity or size, it would probably follow the practice that is well established in the Department of referring the matter to the DPP. However, many minor offences will be committed under the legislation where a reference to the DPP would be inappropriate but where it would be valuable for the regulatory authority to have the power to bring prosecutions itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a nutshell, that is what the amendment is designed to achieve and if accepted, it would achieve that objective in a straightforward way. I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our discussion on the last group of amendments I said why I was opposed to the principle behind this amendment. The responsibility for deciding whether to prosecute is best reposed in the hands of those who have experience in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessment of the extent to which evidence of an act would be admissible in a criminal court, whether the totality of the evidence would be likely to discharge the criminal burden of proof, and whether the evidence could be explained in a comprehensible way to a jury to persuade it to convict, are all matters benefiting from an application of experience and expertise. Obviously, such experience and expertise resides with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Trade and Industry, which has a prosecuting function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those bodies contain, therefore, the necessary resources to bring that quality to bear on the question whether a prosecution should be instituted. That quality would be absent from the designated agency unless the amendment were passed. There is no reason why the agency, in the absence of the amendment, should have the task of adding to its resources personnel with that experience and expertise. For those reasons, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the force of the Minister's comments, but I invite him to consider this point. Surely the question of who is the appropriate authority to bring prosecutions depends on the scale of offence involved. We must adhere to the current practice in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>547</span>
case of major offences, where much complex evidence must be produced. Normally, the DPP would be responsible for such prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am anxious about smaller offences—the carrying on of investment business on a small scale without authorisation, for example. If SIB is to do the job that we expect of it, we cannot argue against its having the expertise to bring prosecutions in relatively minor cases. It seems unnecessarily cumbersome to require a different authority to intervene suddenly and take up a prosecution in less important cases. With due respect, that authority would be a Department of civil servants, unfamiliar with SIB's precise responsibility for monitoring and supervising such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will see a case for SIB to develop experience and expertise in that respect. I do not wish to press the matter to a Division, although it is important. In view of the changes that we have made this afternoon, I hope that the Minister will see the merit in my argument, but, nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
