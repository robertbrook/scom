	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [14 January],</i> No. 2, in page 1, line 9, leave out from second 'date' to end of line 14 and insert 'that number of members shall be appointed by the Inner London Education Authority'.—	<i>[Mr. Buchan.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 15, leave out subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were dealing with the Inner London education authority at our previous sitting and how to develop a more representative democratic appointing body for the governors of the museum. It is not that the amendments in themselves would appoint such a body; they but seek to create the proper type of appointing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not rehearse our earlier arguments; we have already stressed the need to broaden our discussion. At present, one body represents a major section of London, which is ILEA. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy) argued that there were other groupings outside the Inner London boroughs that were connected with the museum. Yes, that is so, but we are not left with a body that represents the whole of London. That was a choice made by his Government, which I suspect he supports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Welwyn Hatfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That being so, we now have to try to repair the problem resulting from that decision. At that time, everyone recognised that the Government's proposal for the abolition of the GLC was not related to a certain body. There were many areas to which that decision was not specifically related, but which had to be dealt with because problems arose,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Minister, Lord Gowrie, said that he recognised that the GLC was not abolished in order to safeguard the arts but that any problems that arose must be dealt with. We are trying to do that. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield said that a problem existed. A variety of people from many areas use the museum—he mentioned tourists, too. He said that he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
was not proposing that they should be represented, but that if people from outside London used the museum, why should they not be represented by another body. In other words, appointments cannot be made from a representative body because other communities of sections are around the perimeter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we follow the logic of that argument, it means having autocratic appointments only. That is wrong. We should attempt to make the appointing body as representative as possible. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) said, the GLC did not make appointments that were in line only with the political complexion of the appointing body, but at least it had the sense and strength of being representative. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield would not have complained about non-representation if the responsibility were left to the GLC; he would have said that it was a sensible perimeter of representation. But that has been abolished. We have lost a body which at least would have appointed a third of the governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a political point. I am trying to deal with a situation that has been caused by the Government who, to save costs and because they dislike Ken Livingston, decided to abolish the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good case for the ILEA. It is the most representative educational body within the perimeter of London. The Museum of London is not a gallery as is the National Gallery. The museum has educational connotations. Even the National Gallery recognises its own education functions. It is not merely aesthetic. The Museum of London has a specific education function. It is related to the past and the present and to the social, political, and aesthetic history and to the fashion history of London. That is closely integrated with education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would further the case for both the democratic accountability and educational function of the museum. It would be a gesture towards alleviating the anxieties, criticisms and bitterness that many people have about the Government's decision. The Bill is not a good example of the consequences of the GLC's abolition, and if even moderate suggestions are rejected, it shows that the Government have entirely ignored the consequences of that abolition. For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister and the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield will support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the last part of Tuesday's sitting. I have read the 	<i>Hansard</i> report very carefully and I should like to take up some points made by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to prevent the City and the Government from acquiring an increasing share of governors on the museum board. We believe that the ILEA should have a right to nominate governors to the board, because, after the abolition of the GLC, the ILEA will be the largest democratically elected body in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a certain element of dejá vu in this because the ILEA covers precisely the same area as the old
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
London county council. I declare an abiding interest in the LCC. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) taught in an LCC school. I was educated in LCC primary and secondary schools, and I like to think that I benefited from that education. Those who attended such schools had a great deal of loyalty to the LCC and those who taught in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the ILEA had the right to nominate members to the board of governors, it would restore some of the links that used to exist with the London county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth while noting that the problem need not have arisen twice. The LCC was abolished by a Conservative Government in 1964 when they set up the Greater London council. The Conservative party is well known for setting up local government bodies and then demolishing them. The GLC was set up so that the Tories of the day could obtain political control of the wider body. However, their attempt to gerrymander local authority boundaries to secure that control did not work because some Tory districts did not wish to be included in the London area. Instead of the new GLC in 1964 being Tory, it was Labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Secretary of State for Education and Science was the prime mover behind the local government reorganisation in 1964 which set up the GLC. I am glad that the issue has come back to haunt him because he deserves it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said last Tuesday that representation should be linked to those who paid the costs, and there is some superficial appeal in that argument. However, that is not always the case. I cite the example of the Lea Valley park authority. The GLC provides 80 per cent, of the revenue of that authority, but 50 per cent, of the representation on the governing body comes from district councils outside Greater London because they have a close interest in what happens in the Lea Valley area. It was decided that because of that close interest, their representation should be disproportionate to the amount of money they contributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's desire to maintain a close link between revenue contributions and nominating rights can be challenged on the grounds of past investment. It causes unhappiness to Labour Members, especially to my colleagues and me in County Hall, that the investment we made on behalf of London ratepayers—for example, for Kenwood, Rangers House in Blackheath and Marble Hill House, for which we provided capital revenue to acquire artefacts, works of art, and so on—is being taken away from the ratepayers and given to a quango. That quango could, no doubt, dispose of the assets in those historic houses if it so wished. That is wrong, because ratepayers' money was used to provide those works of art.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why the Government believe that public assets are second rate and private assets are almost sacrosanct. If a future Labour Government renationalised without compensation—I have always maintained that that should be done, although I believe that my colleagues do not support that principle—there would be cries about the state grabbing and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
taking away private property. However, conversely, if the state hands over over public assets, not a whimper comes from Fleet street and hardly a word of objection is raised within the Conservative party. There is a peculiar attitude towards public assets versus private assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that Inner London ratepayers who are now represented by the new Inner London education authority, have past investment in the Museum of London. That should be recognised. Whatever else has been said, as the ILEA represents the largest concentration of London ratepayers together in one democratically-elected body, surely Conservative Members must recognise that it is appropriate for the ILEA to have nominating rights to the Museum of London's board of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second argument on Tuesday was that the Museum of London was not primarily an educational institution. I do not believe that the Museum of London is any more or any less an educational institution than the Geffrye and the Horniman museums, which are now to be transferred to the Inner London education authority. The Minister said that the Museum of London had strong links with the adult education authority and that that was why the Ministry's arrangements would be different. I remind the Minister that that was not the Government's original position. The original proposals for the disposition of the assets of the Greater London council were for the Geffrye and the Horniman museums to be given to other museums. As I recall it, the Geffrye was to go to the Victoria and Albert museum and the Horniman to the British museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for the Arts made compelling arguments—he persuaded himself, but no one else—to the effect that that was the best way of dealing with the Geffrye and the Horniman museums. The Government have shown that they are open to persuasion about the disposition of those museums, so why should the Minister close his mind now to a different arrangement for the Museum of London?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument that can be made is that ILEA schools make more visits than schools from any other education authority to the Museum of London. I accept that that is so partly because of the size of the Inner London education authority. I understand that 500 or so visits from ILEA schools are made each year to the Museum of London. The links between the museum and the Inner London education authority are strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, being sensible, people will try to operate the chaos being willed upon the government of London by the Government and will try to make things work after the abolition of the GLC. People in this country have the capacity to muddle through despite all the odds, but we make much of the muddle ourselves. Especially in terms of the local government structure of London, the muddle has been created by Parliament, wherein, of course, the Opposition's role has been to oppose, root and branch, what the Government have been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Museum of London and ILEA will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
forge some sort of links. But we want the links to be far more formal and recognised as strong and essential to the vitality of the Museum of London in terms of its exhibitions and its links with the education standards within the Inner London area by ensuring that ILEA has the right to nominate governors to the board of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main reason for our desire to achieve the amendment relates to my first argument. We do not want the City of London to have further nominating rights to the museum's board of governors. The argument is a democratic one. We do not believe that the City of London is the most appropriate body to represent London local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Tuesday that I had to leave early because I was to lunch with the Lord Mayor of London It was a delightful lunch. Of course, the Lord Mayor was as kind, gracious and hospitable as ever. I should like to think that there is a great deal of affection between me, as chairman of the Greater London council and him, as the Lord Mayor of London. So, anything that I now say about the City has nothing to do with my personal feelings for the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just been accused by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) of being a crawler. It is on the record.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall read the record carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept that the City of London is a democratic institution in terms of the other structures of London local government. That is worth remembering since I have mentioned the destruction of the LCC by the Conservative Government in the early 1960s. A Royal Commission was set up to examine the structure of London local government—the Herbert Commission—which made the amazing statement that, "If we were being strictly logical, we would recommend the amalgamation of the City of Westminster and the City of London. But logic has its limits and for this purpose the City of London lies outside of it." That is an amazing statement from a Royal Commission. It realised that, and the City of London has not only been able to defy the laws of logic but all political moves against it from the 19th century, and has done very well. One must admire such a body, and I wish the GLC had learnt more from the ability of the City of London to survive against all the odds. However, we do not accept that the City should be given these increased rights on the governing body of the Museum of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the chaos that we shall inherit from the abolition of the GLC, the next Labour Government will need to look at the whole structure of London local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
government. If I am still a Member of the House, I shall be pressing for the incorporation of the City of London into the surrounding boroughs. We can then maintain the Lord Mayor's Show, keep Mansion House and Guildhall and we shall not be talking about abolition. That will recommend itself to everyone in London. But for the moment the City remains an undemocratic institution in local government terms and we do not want it to increase its representation on the governing body of the Museum of London. The amendment seeks to prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, we had a brief reply from the Minister after a contribution from his hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy), who I am glad to see in his place this morning. I did not anticipate making a further contribution to the debate but, having heard part of what was said and having checked the record, I must make a few more comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the recess there was an entertaining, if somewhat superficial, article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Hickmet) about proceedings on Standing Committees. He was well replied to by one of my hon. Friends in a further article which pointed out how important and vital Standing Committee proceedings could be and instanced the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill as a case in point. Unless I am happily mistaken, these Committee proceedings will not achieve mention in such a newspaper article, nor will they be widely reported. Nevertheless, they are significant because the Bill is the first piece of legislation after the Local Government Act 1985 to transfer powers to other bodies from the GLC, narrow though those powers are. Therefore, the role of the Opposition in Committee, without any personal animus to Conservative members, is to subject what they say to the closest logical scrutiny cosistent with parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Local Government Act caused many problems which the Bill attempts to solve. But there may be other ways to solve them. I shall not go into the history of the destruction of one of the greatest municipal enterprises in the world—the London County Council. That was an act of civic vandalism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the speech of the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy), who said that his constituents had an interest in London and should be represented. He said that ILEA was only part of London—I hope that I am summarising his speech fairly. The City of London is only part of London too, but greater representation is being given to it. If the hon. Gentleman wishes his argument to apply to ILEA, it should apply, too, to that small, limited residential part of London known as the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's argument about his constituents is stronger, as some of them work in London. However, I do not believe that the archaelogical history and medieval development of Welwyn and Hatfield could come within the scope of the history of London. I am sure that there is an adequate local history society in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
do not think that areas outside the GLC, which is a vast suburban area outside the core of London, have much of a case for direct representation. I shall not trespass on the next amendment, but it covers the hon. Gentleman's point about the rest of Greater London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for speaking on behalf of his constituents, but his comments do not hold much logic when they are subjected to scrutiny. We are discussing how we govern civic assets so which we are all proud. There is nothing between the two sides of the Committee in our desire to see the Museum of London continuing to a good future. We are discussing the narrow point about how that can best be discharged with regard to its governors, representation and finance. It is a matter not of political difference but of good civic mechanics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contragulate the Minister on his elevation to the Privy Council. At our previous sitting he stated:
	<br><q><p>"I do not object to the concept of ILEA having an important role."</p></q>
That important role must have some emanation and means of expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He continued:
	<br><q><p>"Two members of the board, appointed by the Prime Minister, have strong educational links. I refer to Professor Pearl and Professor Wilkes."</p></q>
I doubt whether their educational knowledge and skills overlap the general responsibilities of ILEA. The Minister went on to say that
	<br><q><p>"the Prime Minister will continue to have firm regard for that important interest." — 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 14 January 1986; c.63.]</p></q>
The Minister knows the Prime Minister better than I do, so he may be able to speak for her. But he has been involved in matters of state beyond these shores and this is a domestic one with which he may be unfamiliar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing posterity and future Prime Ministers such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr Kinnock), whom I am sure would appoint proper people, However, there may be other Prime Ministers following him who know nothing about education. Therefore, I do not believe that a Minister can give such an undertaking for future Prime Ministers. As we know, Prime Ministers are not always amenable to majority views in their Cabinets, so I doubt whether an undertaking can be given about what future Prime Ministers will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister continued:
	<br><q><p>"I hope that the Committee agrees that my assurances go far enough." </p></q>
	<br><q><p>	<i>(Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 14 January 1986; c.63.]</p></q>
He hoped that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr Buchan) would withdraw his amendment. I believe that "asssurances" is rather a strong word to use. The Minister has not provided us with assurances, but rather the opposite. He acknowledged that ILEA has an important role but did not show how that role would be achieved by the governing body of that important museum. I have not been persuaded one whit although he has used his best endeavours to resist our amendment. We do not know
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
how far the Minister has been given a free hand or whether he must refer matters to a higher authority. I sympathise with him if that is true. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that the Minister's assurances go no way at all, let alone far enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 10, leave out from second 'date' to end of line 14 and insert
	<br><q><p>'that number of members shall be appointed by the joint committee established in London by section 95 of the local Government Act 1985'.</p></q>
This amendment may be a little more probing than the previous one but I may be able to anticipate what the Secretary of State will say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common knowledge that disentangling the manifold powers of the Greater London council has been more difficult than the prime Minister ever dreamt when she decided to include that issue in the conservative party manifesto. Some arguments about who shall do what have still not been properly resolved—for example, collection and disposal of rubbish, maintenance of roads and ferries, and so on. The London Residuary Body that was set up under the 1985 Act was given responsibility for the important jobs of paying pensions, looking at investments, and other matters central to the former statutory responsibilities of the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, section 95 of that Act establishes a co-ordinating committee of successor councils—the existing London boroughs and the Common Council of the city corporation. The co-ordinating committee must be set up before 1 September 1985 to
	<br><q><p>"discharge the functions mentioned in subsection (2) below".</p></q>
Subsection (2) contains six paragraphs setting out the responsibilities of the co-ordinating committee, which should not be confused with the residuary body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-ordinating committee will have one great advantage which I am sure will commend itself to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield. It will cover not only the old LCC area but all the outer London boroughs of the GLC area but not the hon. Gentleman's consitituency in Hertfordshire, therfore, it is reepresentative of all electors. The Act clearly sets out the committee's functions. I shall not quote all the paragraphs (a) to (f) but paragraph (d) is worth quoting and states that the joint committee shall
	<br><q><p>"consult and co-operate, as respects matters affecting those councils
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
or their areas, with the new authorities, the residuary bodies and any other body to which functions or property of the Greater London Council or the council of that county will be transferred by virtue of any provision made by or under this Act and with the staff commission."</p></q>
I emphasise the words,
	<br><q><p>"functions or property of the Greater London Council".</p></q>
It is common knowledge that the Geffrye and Horni-man museums are being transferred to the Inner London Education Authority, although ILEA has always been involved with them. It would not have been equally logical for the Museum of London to be transferred to ILEA because it has a different background and history. However, one function of the GLC was to appoint governors to the governing board of the Museum of London. Unless, there is a legal reason of which I am unaware at the moment—I am not a lawyer I do not understand how a function of the GLC to appoint governors to the museum does not fall within the scope of section 95 of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be contested by the Minister, but only on marginal grounds. If he does not contest it, he may say, "Yes, that may fall within the committee's legal scope although I would not wish to test it in the courts" the Secretary of State for Transport has had enough trouble testing such matters in the courts—"but it is arguable". Even if it falls within the committee's remit, the Minister may say that it is administratively inconvenient for the co-ordinating committee to appoint governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to enable the co-ordinating committee to appoint not all the governors, other than those appointed by the City corporation and the Prime Minister, but only as many as were previously appointed by the GLC. That arrangement would be appropriate because the City corporation and the Prime Minister who will appoint the extra governors already make appointments. They do not necessarily need to make more appointments. The co-ordinating committee will represent the whole of the Greater London area—I emphasise that to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield. It has a duty to do so, so what better body could there be to nominate the governors who were hitherto nominated by the GLC to run this important museum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the committe has only a limited life. However, I do not perceive any limitation on their existence—my hon. Friend the Minister for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) was a member of the Committee that considered the Local Government Bill and will correct me if I am wrong because many matters will continue to need co-ordination and I cannot see a time when the committee's task will be finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. The life of the London Residuary Body is limited by stature to five years. However, as there are still outstanding legal cases from the 1964 reorganisation, there is no chance that the London Residuary Body will be able to discharge all its duties and responsibilities within five years. The co-ordinating committee can continue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
indefinitely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, therefore, that we have established, unless the Minister has evidence to the contrary, that the co-ordinating committee will continue in perpetuity or until a proper all-London directly-elected authority is re-established. The committee will be the temporary caretaker of co-ordination within the Greater London area. When an all-London directly-elected authority is re-established no doubt the legislation that we are discussing will be swept away. Conservative Members are entitled to say that they do not want that day to arrive. However, until it does the governors hitherto appointed by the GLC should be appointed by the all-London co-ordinating committee, which will deal with and represent, albeit indirectly, the whole of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Arts (Mr. Richard Luce)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before answering the debate in full, I must say that after the events of the last two days, I am very relieved that only one person is recording the outcome of this discussion. It is being done in the full glare of the public, so there should be no misunderstanding of our debate. However, I thought earlier that there was likely to be a misunderstanding between two Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) made it clear that amendment No. 3 sought to provide that the six vacancies created by clause 1 on the board of governors should be filled by appointees of the joint committee established in London under seciton 95 of the Local Government Act 1985. That joint committee was set up by the London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London to co-ordinate the preparations for transferring functions from the GLC to the councils. I must stress that the joint committee is essentially a transitional body and is not permanent. It could cease to exist at any time after abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal would not sit easily with the joint committee's other functions, set out under the Local Government Act, to consult, consider and to co-ordinate. The joint committee is not an executive body. More importantly, the same argument applies to the proposal for the ILEA appointments or appointments from any other section within the Greater London area. The Bill starts with the principle that those who are providing the main funds for the Museum of London should be the bodies who have the power to appoint governors to the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not the people of London the main contributors to the museum? Surely the joint committee represent those persons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can add any more to what I have said on several occasions. Of course, the Museum of London is very important to the people of London. But there is a great national and wider interest in the museum. I am told that it has visitors from all over this country and other countries. How-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
ever, its funding is confined to two bodies—the Government and the City Corporation, each providing 50 per cent. It is on that basis that we should define the powers for appointment. I cannot stress enough my assurance that the wider interests will be taken fully into account when we determine the appointments to the board. That is an important factor which will be borne in mind throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of appointments to other great national museums and galleries shows that a cross-section of people have been appointed to those bodies. Such people have a cross-section of interests and expertise which are of great value to the work of the museums and those who visit the museums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our two main objections to the amendment are that appointments should be made on a funding basis with the assurance that the London-wide interests and responsibilities will be taken into account. The subsidiary, but important other reason is that in any event, even if I were to concede the principle, the body is not an appropriate one to consider in that context. Its role is not that of an executive body. It exists to deal with transitional problems—to consult, to consider and to co-ordinate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background and on my main arguments, I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one doubts the intentions—the good intentions, perhaps—of the Minister. The Bill does not represent major legislation, but a relatively small aspect of abolition. Nevertheless, it is an important Bill, as is evidenced by the fact that all of us are in Committee discussing it. No doubt the Minister is listening to the arguments and we hope that we shall be influencing him in some way in terms of his future intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the Minister's statements about the intention to preserve some kind of London-wide presence in the appointment of new governors to the museum board who have knowledge of the Greater London area. But, intentions are not enough when drafting legislation. Assurances are given by Ministers in Committee. Those assurances are made honestly then, but a little later, because of a cataclysmic event within the Government, a Minister can suddenly discover that he or she is further up the slippery pole and a new Minister is charged with implementing the legislation who knows nothing of the good intentions of the original Minister when the clause was being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would make for good legislation and would be far better if intentions honestly stated in Committee were made into statutory provisions within the legislation. That is our reason for the amendment. So that the Minister can translate his intentions into positive action, we suggest that the London co-ordinating committee should have the right to nominate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the London co-ordinating committee was not the most appropriate body. I grant that it is not the best body, but it is the only one that we have which approximates to a London-wide forum in which all the London boroughs are represented. As
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
perhaps the Minister will know as well as I, it is not working as well as it could because of the political differences within the London co-ordinating committee, but it is the only body which represents London as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is that the political control has been altered. The GLC is Labour-controlled because we were elected through the ballot box. In that sense, our legitimacy is beyond challenge. However, the London co-ordinating committee, which has the task of disposing of much of the GLC's services and property, comprises one representative from each London borough, which gives it a Tory majority. That is an atrocious act of despoliation of London local democracy. It is offensive to the Opposition. A local labour-controlled authority which has been elected through the ballot box is to be replaced in some aspects by a body which has a Tory majority by virtue of legislation, not through the ballot box.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition look forward with great eagerness to the 1986 local elections in London because we are confident that control will revert to those who are best suited to run London—the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In spite of my hon. Friend's criticisms of the new co-ordinating committee, in terms of its democratic content, will not my hon. Friend agree that it is much more democratic that the corporation of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be hard put to it to be more undemocratic than the corporation of the City of London. I have already touched on my reasons for saying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the London co-ordinating committee is not the ideal body. It was not set up by us. It is yet another example of the way in which the Government have had to make do and mend to try to prevent utter chaos and breakdown arising from the abolition of the GLC. No one in their right mind would have come up with abolition or the proposals that have flowed from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abolition is a fact. We cannot deal with anything other than that which exists. I suppose it is the essence of politics that one must deal with a situation as it is, not as one would wish it to be. Of course, one hopes that wise political action will create circumstances which are far more desirable and closer to one's original intentions. We have what we have been given. Nothing else is on offer. That being so, we tabled the amendment because we believed that the London co-ordinating committee could at least bring a London-wide presence to the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the co-ordinating committee was a transitional body. That might be the Government's intention, but the only reason that the committee will be transitional is because the next Labour Government will get rid of it. Certainly, it will not be transitional in terms of the functions that it must discharge now. Despite its internal difficulties, the committee must take up several London-wide functions and maintain them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by a terrible perversion of justice the Conservative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
party won the next general election [Hon. Members: "Hear, Hear."] That shows the perversion, Sir Anthony. I shall not say more as it could be considered unparliamentary terminology. To hear Conservative Members cheering for perversion leaves me cold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a Conservative Government were elected at the next general election, the London co-ordinating committee would have to remain because there will be nothing else to do with the services for which it will then be responsible. The committee might need to retain or assume responsibility for research and intelligence for London, for example. Planning is another example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been great arguments on the committee about GLC functions such as the disability resource team. At that time, the committee decided not to assume responsibility for the team because it believed that the team was too expensive. But the Tory boroughs refused to assume the responsibility, which speaks volumes for their lack of care for the 500,000 or more disabled people in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the chairman of the London co-ordinating committee is none other than councillor Peter Bowness the leader of the Tory-controlled Croydon council. One of his reasons for getting so up tight about abolition is that the Government are deciding that levies on a per capita basis might be the best way of raising revenue. That is great for the City of London with its small population but bad news for Tory Croydon because it is the most populous London borough. Councillor Bowness, struggling hard to make sense of GLC abolition in terms of his borough, rejected the idea of the disability resource team going to the London co-ordfinating committee. Instead, the team will go the the London Residuary Body, on which one of the members appointed by the Government is—guess who— Peter Bowness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was merely pointing out there are certain difficulties in terms of the London co-ordinating committee's nominating governors to the board of the Museum of London. Despite those difficulties, the London co-ordinating committee is more appropriate for the democratic representation of London than the City of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the reasons why the amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it appropriate that the initials of the London co-ordinating committee are "LCC"? The LCC writ large is once again the only proper county authority for London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was deliberately resisting the use of that acronym on the grounds that it is an insult to the old London county council to have a contrived body such as the London co-ordinating committee inheriting its initials. That is why I have always used it full title. I would not wish to grace it with those wonderful initials of the LCC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said more about the imperfections of the London co-ordinating committee than its suitability.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
But I want to make it clear that Opposition Members are fair minded and, although we resent the way in which the Government gerrymandered abolition and produced a Tory majority for a residuary body, we are prepared to accept that body because it represents more of London than the City and let it nominate the board of the Museum of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend is advancing the case for a borough involvement in the organisation of the museum, could he give the Committee more information on the record of the boroughs in assisting city-wide bodies such as the museum? Is that a good record or do those boroughs spend a greater proportion of money on local matters than on the arts and museums?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In replying to that intervention will the hon. Minister try to bring his remarks a little more closely to the amendment. We are going rather wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall abide by what you say, Sir Anthony, because I would not want to be ruled out of order, even in that graceful fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised an important issue. In the past there has been no great need for the boroughs to intervene directly in strategic London-wide services because the GLC did it for them. The money paid to the Museum of London by the GLC was not the GLC's money but the London boroughs' money because the GLC's revenue comes from the precept that it raises on the London boroughs. Therefore, the contribution made to the Museum of London comes indirectly from the boroughs to the GLC. It is only because the strategic authority for London is being abolished that we are in such a mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why the London co-ordinating committee should have a nominating right is because it will continue through the life of a future Conservative Government which, frankly, I do not believe we shall have, and continue for a while when the next Labour Government looks at the structure of London local government. We shall be unable to restore London-wide government in the City within a few weeks of inheriting office for the simple reason that we shall need to deal with so many other national problems. It will not be a question of picking up the pieces, we shall first have to search around to find them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the London co-ordinating committee will have a continuing function and the Minister is being misled by his officials if he thinks that the London co-ordinating committee will be a short-lived body. It will have to take on more responsibilities rather than less; another reason why it is useful for the London co-ordinating committee to have a nominating right. At a future date that committee could be asked to contribute to the costs of the museum because the museum will be left very much to the mercy of two bodies, one of which, the Government, are not renowed for their willingness to spend money on the arts or on museums—[Hon. Members: "No.".] Despite what the Minister may wish to do, I suspect that he will have great difficulty arguing a case for more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
Money for the museum and the arts as the economic crisis in the country gets worse. The Museum of London might be better served by a wider range of financing bodies than those proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that his criticism about the Conservative Administration cutting back on finance for the arts and museums is endorsed by their desire to charge people for entering museums and art galleries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going very wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would agree with my hon. Friend and leave it at that. Perhaps we shall have a chance later to discuss charges and financing and the point can then be amplified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London co-ordinating committee might be a future source of funding for the museum if its representatives were on the governing body. The Minister should bear that in mind. Other arguments about democratic accountability may fail to impress the Minister but a straightforward economic argument might stand a greater chance of success. I hope the Minister will now rethink his attitude towards the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not and do not intend to spend much time on the issue. First, because of the mass of expertise behind me and, secondly, because to some extent we have deployed the kernel of our case to seek some means of ensuring that the appointing bodies are more accountable and representative of London people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought that ILEA was a common sense and practical way to achieve that. We do not like the necessity of falling back on the co-ordinating committee because of the circumstances in which that committee was made essential. However, the Government have decided to abolish the GLC and the only two bodies which can speak in any sense for the people of London, and be accountable, are ILEA and the co-ordinating committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Murphy) was powerful in his strictness about ILEA, which is an incomplete representation. The construction of the co-ordinating committee is peculiar—like a camel made by a committee in one sense—but it deals with the problem posed by the hon. Gentleman becaue it covers the whole area of London. Therefore, the committee provides a natural fallback position and we were surprised to learn from the Minister that he did not intend to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall at this point pause to apologise to the Committee. I had to leave because of an urgent telephone call which is relevant to the Committee's discussions. The Manpower Services Commission has decided to cut severely the number of young people employed in training through the volunteer services. The cut affects about one-third of the young people working for voluntary agencies in my constituency which is an example of matters being put entirely into the hands of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
financial interests of the City or the Government. Despite all that the Government say about how the state must not be involved, about the community, how we must have voluntary work, and so on, employment has been cut overnight affecting many young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the government's attitude towards the state in that respect. The MSC has taken over. In the Bill, the Government take the power unto themselves along with their friends in the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I have an additional emotional reason for saying that we must find some means of making the bodies that are established more representative and accountable to the people. It must not be left to the hierarchy of state and finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a paradoxical and ludicrous situation. The Government abolish the democracy of London. London is the only capital now left without its own government. It is nonsense. Imagine the people of Rome, Paris or Buenos Aires deciding not to have a government for their capital cities. We all know that it was done out of political pique. We are now having to try to pick up the pieces. It is claimed that there is a logical case for London not being governed by central government, but that it can be done by fragmented bodies in the boroughs. Having done that, the Government recognised that it could not be done in that way so they set up a non-elected body, which at least to an extent was accountable to people in London—the co-ordinating committee. Therefore, the Government's case does not stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By such action, the Government have dealt with the political problem that they feared, which is the nature of the government of London. But they have not dealt with the problems that will exist when the government of London is abolished. The previous Minister for the Arts Lord Gowrie, admitted that the arts will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever action we take will involve problems. We have practical experience in Scotland of what happens when strategic governance is removed, especially in relation to the arts. Two years ago, the funding responsibilities for the arts were removed from the regions to the district councils in Scotland. Instead of Strathclyde council supporting the arts throughout its area, the arts became the responsibility of Glasgow, Renfrew, Cunninghame and all the other district councils. We immediately plunged into problems. Prior to that, Strathclyde council was content and did well in supporting Scottish opera in Glasgow. Now that that duty has been removed the council asks why it should support a theatre which is within the area of another district council, and it has fallen back on to Glasgow for support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a further example which has real relevance to the debate. The Highland region supported a theatre. For the first time a theatre was established in the Highland area in Inverness. It was for touring companies as well as amateur groups and so on. Now that the duty to support the arts has been removed from region to district councils, district council ask why they should support a theatre in Inverness. Only three of the 11 district councils now support that theatre. There has been a collapse of about one-third in support
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
for the arts in Scotland. For example, Caitheness and Sutherland district council believes that it does not have the responsibility to look after a theatre in Inverness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To try to deal with that, the Highland regional council transferred the ownership of the theatre to the education committee, which was still run on a regional basis. Some district councils felt so strongly that they did not wish to support the arts in Scotland that the Highland region education committee was taken to the Court of Session. Such a strength of feeling occurs when strategic functions are reallocated. It is not easy to combine fragmented areas in that respect. The government cannot govern London satisfactorily by setting up an ad hoc body, although a co-ordinating committee is at least a move in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the co-ordinating committee is a transitional body. I do not accept that. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) that it is transitional only in the sense that a future Labour Government will abolish it. Heaven knows what problems a future Labour Government will have. It will be difficult to administer the arts because by that time we may have to re-open theatres. At present, five theatres, including Sadler's Wells, are under threat due to the shift of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend says that he does not like the initials "LCC" to be used in connection with the London co-ordinating committee as those initials are equated with the London county council. Perhaps we should use the title, the "Luce co-ordinating committee".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to make progress, were it not for the delaying interventions of the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield. This is the last opportunity that the Minister has, and I plead with him to establish accountability as it will set an example for the Government to follow in their future actions. Otherwise, the Government will signal that they intend to ride roughshod over the demands and needs of the 20th and 21st centuries. The appointing body should at least be accountable, even if it is not under total democratic control. If the Minister cannot concede our amendment today, I hope that he will consider it on Report. I fear that we shall have to summon up the House as a whole in defence of democracy when the Bill is again discussed on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I draw attention to starred amendment No. 15. If my hon Friends had not been so intent in getting through clause 1, I had hoped that we would deal with that amendment next week. We shall not have to leave it, due to the technicalities of procedure, but I hope to return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 seeks to remove the word "may" and insert "shall". That has been a burden throughout the history of Standing Committees. I remember how my old friend, Willie Ross, who was Secretary of State for Scotland for a long time, could keep Committees going for at least three sittings on the distinctions between "may" and "shall". I have no intention of doing that because there is nothing complex about the amendment. We believe that the duty should be laid upon the museum and that it should not be a matter of choice. The museum must "provide archaelogical services" and
	<br><q><p>"undertake archaeological investigations and research".</p></q>
That could be argued as placing an intolerable demand on the resources of a museum, but that should not affect the Committee. The Government have willingly undertaken to ensure the resources of the museum and have increased their involvement by making their contribution one half instead of a third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of London is eager to retain half the governancy of the museum, so it should be equally keen to ensure that there are sufficient resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise a major future for the Museum of London and that a duty should be laid upon it. When referring to institutions of such importance, I do not believe that it is a matter for the governors, trustees or administrators solely to take such decisions. They should not be left solely to decide charges, either. We must accept that there is a social responsibility that is wider than the museum's governancy and the daily decision taking. Unless such duties are written into the Bill, it becomes a matter of choice for the governors or directors and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As each day passes, more of our history is being overturned by archaeological exploration, and it is even more important that a central body should have responsibility for that. That was my reason for tabling my earlier amendment referring to the records of the GLC. It would be helpful if the Minister outlined his views on this non-controversial amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such amendments are always curious and appear to be nit-picking, but the Minister should give us assurances and explain the distinction that the Bill draws between the various responsibilities of the museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 3(1) gives a full and good description of the duties of the museum, such as to curate, acquire, exhibit, research, study, increase understanding and appreciation, and so on. The Committee will agree that that is a very concise and satisfactory definition of what the museum should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 3(1) states that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
	<br><q><p>"it shall be the duty of the Board"</p></q>
so why is there is a distinction between the duties referred to in subparagraphs 	<i>(a),</i> 	<i>(b)</i> and 	<i>(c)</i> and the archaeological duties referred to in subsection (3)? What is in the Minister's mind when he distinguishes between primary duties and optional archaeological one? I should be grateful if he would assist the Committee in understanding that distinction. How do the optional duties fit with subsection (2) which allows the board to
	<br><q><p>"do all such things as they think necessary or expedient for those purposes"?</p></q>
Presumably, "those purposes" refers to subsection 3(1) and excludes the matters referred to in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A distinction has been made between those responsibilities and the Minister should clarify what is in his mind and what weight he expects the new board to give to those two different categories of responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London's record on archaeology has been somewhat patchy. Some good work has been done but in the interests of development, I am sure that the Minister would agree that much has been left undone. Some archaeological work has been conducted under severe time pressures because of the demands of interest rates on developers and the need for office space and other building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many developers now take a much more constructive attitude towards helping in archaeological sites on which they build? That was never more true than in London at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I did not seek to criticise developers but the Committee knows that they work under enormous financial pressures and the costs of building and borrowing money are acute. Unfortunately, those pressures are on a different timescale to the rather careful demands of exploring a site archaeologically. The patience and steady, slow work involved in uncovering a site do not fit happily with development. With the best will in the world, developers must put comparatively short timescales on the archaeological work that can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record could be improved and for a city that has been built on and over so much there is much that we do not know about its archaeology, especially in more recent times. I am not referring to our Roman or Saxon past but, say, 300 or 400 years ago. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will agee that it should be made clear to the new governors—either on the record today, but preferably in a redrafting of the Bill—that archaeology is as important as the other functions. By accepting this modest and constructive amendment, the Minister would ensure that that is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) is correct. The face of London changes day by day. Yesterday, I was walking along Victoria Street 	<i>[Interruption.</i>]—I was walking because I was not on official GLC business—and remembered that not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
so long ago there were some fine Victorian buildings there. I often see a former Primer Minister—Harold Wilson—strolling down Victoria street from his flat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to give a personal illustration of the way in which the face of London changes. Conservative Members may remember the handsome Victorian mansion and office blocks that used to be in Victoria street which have been replaced by huge steel and concrete buildings. I have looked at the huge steel structure on the west side of Victoria street and I do not believe that many visitors will come to London to look at such office blocks. In 100 or 200 years—assuming that there has not been a nuclear catastrophe and that the buildings will still be there—no one will want to come and see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enormous changes are taking place all over London. Such buildings are erected quickly and because they are so high the foundations tend to be deep. Much of London's history lies under the ground and is being destroyed by those new buildings and the demand for new roads. The Government wish to see more roads and to take people away from public transport. That means that a great deal of London's subterranean history will be destroyed. I recommend to the Committee a fascinating book by Ellis Hillman entitled "Underground London".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about many of the facilities provided by Victorians. On Tuesday we heard about Basil Getty and London's sewerage system. You will be interested to know, Sir Anthony, that Basil Getty's original designs still exist and are held in the GLC area. The future of those records is crucial to the archeological services of London and its history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many records are threatened by the abolition of the GLC. There is a question mark over the archaeological services, despite what the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said. I agree that some developers are showing greater awareness of their responsibilities with regartd to archaeological finds. However, I do not believe that there are sufficient guarantees that historical evidence below London's streets will be preserved long enough to be studied fully by archaeologists and those who are interested in London's history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can only inherit such records and pass them on to future generations. It is our responsibility to look carefully at the Bill to ensure that when the Museum of London takes over responsibility for London's archaeological services those records remain in good hands and are safeguarded for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until recently, there was no comprehensive archaeological service for Greater London. A series of local initiatives led to the establishment of individual units, especially during the 1970s, to meet the needs of specific areas of the metropolis. However, funding was, as ever, inadequate and coverage of the area was unequal. That led to the establishment by the GLC of the Greater London archaeological service in 1983. I do not suppose that the Prime Minister even knew about that when she proposed the abolition of the GLC in the Tory party election manifesto of 1983 in such a high-handed authoritarian manner, about which we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
have heard a lot in recent days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many parts of Greater London lie on the superimposed remains of earlier settlements, as did those buildings in Victoria Street. The deeper foundations required for 20th century buildings and the larger roads, for which there is constant pressure on the Government from the British Roads Federation, lead to more destruction. If archaeological evidence is to be studied, it must be rescued immediately, often under extremely adverse conditions. That is known as rescue archaeology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Greater London archaeological service deals with the needs of rescue archaeology in all 32 London boroughs outside the city of London, the service is run by the Museum of London and the Passmore Edwards museum, which is very close to my heart and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GLC's historic buildings division takes responsibility for the co-ordination of the service, but that responsibility will pass to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England under the Local Government Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the establishment grant, the GLC was able to offer grants to individual excavation projects on the basis of their local significance. However, there is no guarnatee that that funding will continue. Through its strategic planning powers the GLC has been able to exercise control over permission for large-scale developments, mineral extraction and green belts, taking archaeological circumstances into account. That will not be possible with the loss of the strategic authority. We shall have to rely on the goodwill of developers. If the powers still exist, they will not be used with the same enthusiasm with which the GLC tried to preserve London's archaeological heritage. That is a further implication of GLC abolition. A strategic authority such as the GLC is in a good position to maintain that strategic element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special provision was made for archaeology in all GLC developments, such as new highways, housing, factories and fire brigade schemes. The London boroughs and successor authorities may not have the will or the means to take archaeology into account. The Minister will have to give the Committee some firm assurances. Although we shall accept his assurances, we would prefer to see safeguards written clearly into the Bill. There is no substitute for resolute action enshrined in the Bill. We cannot rely on the Minister's good intentions—no doubt they are sincerely expressed—to support the archaeological services of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Greater London sites and monuments record does not form part of the archaeological service, but the two are closely related. It has been developed as a research and planning tool for the management of all aspects of London's historical environment. It operates on the GLC's mainframe computer, using GLC computer services. Those services are in doubt as well. Again, we are talking about the London co-ordinating committee and the London Residuary Body. Disman-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
tling the GLC which, through the LCC, inherited functions of the Middlesex county council has proved to be a monumental task. However anti-GLC, no one can honestly say that the abolition of the GLC has been easy after considering all the services and functions for which the GLC was responsible. The GLC's computer services to the archaeological service are vital. The GLC, as well as providing funding for the sites and monuments records, has computerised its own records of historic buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Historic and Buildings Monuments Commission maintains the existing level of funding, the Greater London archaeological service may have to operate with reduced efficiency. Prior to the establishment of the service in 1983, a number of local excavation sites had been set up based either on museums or county archaeological services. Even so, more than 25 per cent, of the London boroughs still receive no professional coverage, and there is little opportunity to establish common approaches to problems and needs because resources are becoming even more scarce. If the archaeological service is not developed and funded, the advances made in the last 10 years may be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the loss of the GLC, resources that have been taken for granted will no longer be available. That is why we hope to ensure that the Bill makes adequate provision for that vital service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee further on the amendment, but it is appropriate to highlight some of the links with other matters that we shall discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financing of the Museum of London will be changed considerably. The Government and the City corporation will each provide 50 per cent., instead of the GLC, the Government and the City corporation each paying one third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the board "shall" rather than "may" provide archaeological services. Under the Bill, the board has no obligation to do so. The City corporation and the Government will have to increase their contributions to keep the board going at its present level. The third contribution from the GLC will be removed. While the Government and the City will have to spend more, they are, at the same time, taking on board the archaeological services for London—but only as an option and at a time when finance is reduced. They will not have a duty laid upon them. If we are to help London's archaeological service, those responsible for its finance should be obliged to find it. It appears that the reverse will be the result unless our amendment is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be premature by asking the Minister to explain more about any discussions that will take place within the board of governors about whether it will use these powers. How widely will its deliberations be known outside? I assume that the board will not sit in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hitherto, one third of the board's members, having been nominated by the GLC, could publicise such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
discussions. It is not like the Cabinet with its absolute secrecy ensured under good old military discipline. I am sure that the deliberations of the board will not come under that category, even though a degree of discretion may have to be used. Obviously it will be reported how much money is spent and on what. It appears that there will be no direct feed-in to the citizens of London if the Government have their way. As the Government have directed that the board may undertake the archaeological service—which is very comprehensive as it can buy or sell sites—how will any decisions be made, and will the citizens of London be told about those decisions? More importantly will the board of governors' general meetings, like those of the Metropolitan water board and other public bodies, now vandalised, be open to the public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments, as has been explained, seek to replace the discretion of how the Museum of London provides archeological services and undertakes archaeological investigations and research with a statutory obligation to do so. The second amendment in the group seeks to make that obligation at the request of the London co-ordinating committee or a London borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee agrees that the Greater London archaeological service provides an excellent service and it is widely respected as providing one of the best metropolitan archaeological services in Europe. I readily accept, as I did on Second Reading, that the GLC played a leading part in setting up that service. On a recent visit to the Museum of London, I saw the overall service that it provided for Greater London. I am sure that other hon. Members have also visited the museum. Clearly it gives an excellent service, and it is important for it to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The museum has carried out that service without any obligation to do so. At no time has the service suffered by being run under discretionary powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely those discretionary powers were with the GLC? As the Minister knows, the GLC is a directly elected body with rating powers and is a different organisation from the board of governors. Is that not right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I am really saying is that there was no specific obligation to provide those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of governors—I accept that this is not an overriding factor—has made it clear that it wishes to continue the service and does not need an overriding obligation. I do not accept that as an essential argument because it is for the Committee, the Government and Parliament to decide how we should proceed. However, that factor should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that the funding of the service will be safe with the clear commitment now being given by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. The board is happy to consult with members of the London borough councils and will, at the same time, take into account the needs of London as a whole because the aim is to provide a centralised service. Therefore, when representations are made by borough councils it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
is right and proper that they should be taken into account. The undertaking is to provide a London-wide centralised service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To suggest that the London co-ordinating committee should have such power is to misunderstand the committee's role. I have already explained the role of the co-ordinating committee. It is set up as a forum to balance and co-ordinate plans for abolition and has no particular powers. To give the committee powers would be at odds with its purpose and design.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members want to turn those requests into demands and ability into an obligation. That is not necessary. The museum can be consulted and would, I know, be glad of a council's contribution. We can certainly leave the museum to make a judgment based on any advice that is given. But the Bill ensures the future of that service by statutory provision. That is an important point because this is the first time that there has been a statutory provision—I accept with discretionary powers—to acknowledge the importance of archaeology. In clause 2(2)—I believe that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Mr. Fisher) referred to this point—we see that
	<br><q><p>"The Board may subject to the provisions of this Act, do all such things as they think necessary or expedient for those purposes and their functions under this Act."</p></q>
To emphasise the importance we attach to archaeology, clause 2(3) 	<i>(a)</i> says that the board may "provide archaeological services"—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I want to develop the point. In stressing this archaeological service by specifying it in the Bill we are emphasising the importance which we attach to archaeology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all hon. Members take that point, but will the Minister address himself to the fact that the Bill makes a distinction between subsection (1), which deals with the board's obligations and duties, and subsection (3)? They are couched in different terms and a distinction is made. Will the Minister explain which distinction is in his mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we are leaving a discretionary power in respect of the archaeological services. However, I must stress again that the Bill provides a step forward rather than a step backward because no provision is made anywhere for archaeological services. That does not detract from the fact that the GLC established the common service. I acknowledge that, and the service is doing an excellent job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I refer to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just develop this point because if I constantly give way to interventions I shall find it difficult to make important points about the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission? It has given a clear undertaking to fund this important service. However, I should stress that all other forms of funding provided by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission are also discretionary. I know that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
Opposition Members will say that that is not entirely relevant, but I think that factor must be taken into account. Although all other forms of funding are discretionary, here we would be making an exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provision is a firm enough assurance that we are giving special priority to archaeology. Furthermore—I cannot recall whether this point was made on Second Reading—it has already been announced that the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission's grant from the Exchequer for 1986-87 will include an additional £7.75 million in respect of all functions taken over by the commission from the GLC. That includes archaeology, and the Commission has given a clear commitment to provide the funding support needed for this overall co-ordinating service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides a positive and concrete step forward. I believe that we have struck the right balance in making statutory provision for this service but to go further would be unwise. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will allow us to proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with the tone of the Minister's speech but unhappy about some of the conclusions and consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that the Bill is a step forward, and I have no doubt that that is his intention. But the fact that the primary duty of the museum is established under sub-section (1) as compulsory with "shall" and in sub-section (2) as discretionary with "may" immediately throws doubts upon it. In some ways it would have been better if it had not been mentioned. It is the old problem of the general versus the exclusive in legislation. If it is exclusive, 	<i>(a), (b),</i> and 	<i>(c),</i> are mentioned, but if it is general 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(c)</i> and 	<i>(d)</i> are included. If only 	<i>(a)</i> to 	<i>(c)</i> are mentioned, it is assumed immediately that 	<i>(d)</i> is not included. Especially when financial restrictions are involved, 	<i>(d)</i> is the one that will go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's intention, but I do not agree that the stark contrast between "shall" and "may" would cast doubts. If anything, the right hon. Gentleman's remarks have strengthened our argument that this aspect, too, should be dealt with in the same way as the other aspects—preserving the exhibition and so on and the general duty of promoting understanding. It might have been better if only the archaeological reference had been included and if none had been included it might have been safer. I ask the Minister to look at that point again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it was intended that the museum's present practice in that respect would continue. But there is likely to be financial stringency. Yesterday's White Paper shows that arts spending will decline. So it will not be easy for the Minister to ensure that the Government's half of the commitment continues to increase so that present practice can continue. Consequently, that will apply to the City's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is even more difficult because we are dealing not de novo but where there has been specific action—the abolition of the GLC. Whenever such a change is made, consequences flow from it. The GLC, as the governing body for the whole of London, could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
play an important role in terms of archaeology. It was precisely because the GLC had strategic power to control the planning of an overall London strategy that the GLC could give permission and support for large developments which is not open now for boroughs to undertake. I am holding talks with the borough of Southwark about developments in the arts which could take place. Problems face smaller boroughs which do not have such strategic controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the end of March, the GLC can exercise control over and give permisison for large developments, mineral extraction and green belts and take all the archaeological implications into account. Below our feet in London there is much material from which to learn. Once the strategic authority has gone, that opportunity will go, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult for a museum, without authority in statute that it must perform such action, to intervene so as to assist or resist the action of a borough. For that reason, among others, we have tried to provide some safeguard by way of amendment No. 8. I recognise that that amendment contains some imperfections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision was made by the GLC for archaeological purposes when several cross-borough developments took place in respect of highways, housing, factories and so on. Boroughs and the successor authorities will not be able to deal with such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Greater London sites and monuments record does not form part of the archaeological service, but the two are related. The record has been developed within the GLC and is remarkable. It is criminal that those engaged in that work have been disbanded. They were advancing into new areas of . local authority and administration by taking power properly down from the state and distributing it. They developed the archaeologic services as a research and planning tool as an integral part of all planning for London. We know that that will no longer happen, even with a co-ordinating committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's actions are monstrous. I hope that the Minister for the Arts will concede this part at least. Unless the compulsory powers are given, the museum will not have the authority for the services. The fact that it is mentioned, though not as a compulsory duty, pushes it back to a discretionary one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend saying that if subsection (3) did not exist while the first two subsections remained with their mandatory obligation, and a comprehensive archeological service were being supplied, a court could say that such matters came within the ambit of subsections (1) and (2)? Is he saying that far from being an advance, as suggested by the Minister, if it came to a matter of law it is conceivable that a comprehensive archeological service could be regarded as being mandatory, whereas the Bill provides that such a service is discretionary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the burden of my argument. I cannot say how the law courts would decide the matter, but that sort of problem arises because of the distinction between the words "may" and "shall". A general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
duty under the word "shall" goes beyond the general when the responsibilities are listed, and omissions cannot be regarded as being included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the museum has a general duty to do certain things and the Bill then states that it shall do 	<i>(a),</i> 	<i>(b)</i> and 	<i>(c),</i> that means that all other matters are excluded. What happens if a precept argument arises, when boroughs are asked to contribute? Their first argument will be that they have no duty to do so. The words "may" and "shall" create a distinction. I recognise that the Minister intends to do the right thing, but there is a danger that problems will arise. My hon. Friend extended the argument by referring to the law courts, which is an important point. I hope that the Minister will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the difficulties posed by amendment No. 8. It is asking a lot that not just the joint committee should ask for such services but that an individual borough may do so. We could rectify that on Report to say "will consider" rather than "shall", but I wish to link the boroughs to the museum. They should not have to go to the museum to ask for expertise on building and planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to my technical arguments about the words "may" and "shall". Experience shows that problems arise from that distinction and do so when local authorities are being squeezed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the museum would prefer to be given the statutory duty of maintaining an archaeological service. Under financial restrictions, it must decide whether to use its resources for duties that it is compelled to carry out so that its discretionary powers become a secondary consideration. I have little doubt about how I would react in those circumstances. Statutory duties will have priority.

It might have been better if such duties had not been specified, but better still if they had been made compulsory. I believe that the museum's staff would prefer not to have to exercise a judgment on discretionary duties. Legal problems could arise if the museum decided to spend money on discretionary duties rather than its mandatory ones, the words "shall" and "may" create all sort of problems, and I ask the Minister to consider them. If he could reassure me, I would willingly withdraw amendment No. 8, as I recognise that difficulties could arise if we said that the board must respond to an individual borough. I should prefer to leave that matter to the board's discretion. However, the Minister should reassure us that he will consider amendment No. 7 on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am being as serious as Opposition spokesmen ever can be in Committee, so I hope that the Minister recognises that I am not arguing a political point. I regard what the Government have done to London seriously, but were I in favour of the abolition of the GLC I should argue in favour of amendment No. 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had explained fully enough why I wished the Committee to resist the amendment. In normal circumstances, I should not

have said more but the hon. Gentleman has spoken with great force and feeling and I am sorry that I cannot meet him on that point, but I owe him another reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said about the museum. The board made it clear that it neither wanted nor needed such a duty. I explained that that was not an overriding factor in determining the right thing to do, but the hon. Gentleman suggested that the board would want such an obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking from the position of the director and staff, rather than the governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the governors are accountable, and I can only relate their position. They are fully and strongly committed to the archaeological services in London, and I stress that the Bill provides a statutory obligation. The hon. Gentleman recognises that although I accept that he would like us to go further, and I acknowledge that he feels strongly about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary duty of the museum is kept short and refers to the museum's essential role. Its general powers are wide-ranging, but the subsection referring to archaeology is included to avoid any doubt about the need for the provision of archaeological services. We decided that the power should be specified in the Bill so as to acknowledge the importance of those services. I have explained why I do not believe I can go further. I have accepted and listened to the reasoned arguments that have been put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify something for my purposes? The Minister said that the Bill set a statutory obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Statutory provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister said "obligation". I do not understand that. Perhaps he wants to change his wording now. The Bill might provide a statutory function. It gives the board some powers, but it contains no obligation, which is why we are trying to change the wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recall every word that I used— although we must be careful about that nowadays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrote it down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he wrote it down—I expect that several people did. We might have to have a Select Committee to examine the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill ensures the future of archaeological services by statutory provision, but, of course, a discretionary power is there. I acknowledge the strong view put forward by the hon. Member for Paisley, South that he believes that we should go a stage further. I tried to explain earlier why I did not believe that it would be right to go further, but because of the importance that the Government attach to the provision of archaeological services, it is right to specify that in the Bill, which I hope will be of some help to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend agree that it is not the words used that matter, but it is the intention behind them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Luce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to my hon. Friend, I have been able to clarify precisely what the purpose of the clause is, which shows the value of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the matter. But what was said by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) cannot go unchallenged. It is the whole basis of legislation which is on the statute book that intentions are not good enough. It must be codified in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman missed the relevance of my comment to yesterday's activities in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all Committee Members do not doubt the Minister's intentions in the matter. The governors, the staff and the director of the museum, and if it came to it—heaven forbid—a law court would be able to refer to the report of the Committee's proceedings and read of the Minister's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, after the Committee's proceedings have finished, all they will read is the words of the Act. They will not refer back to what the Minister intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point. The report of the Committee's sittings will be available to those people, but a court of law must give priority to the Act. In that respect, it would be the wording of the Act rather than the Minister's intentions that guided a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not yet said what advice he would give to the director and staff when they were faced with a dilemma of reduced funding in any one year. If they were having to limit their expenditure on various functions, it is almost inevitable and correct in the light of the Act that the director, staff and the governors would look at their budget for a forthcoming year of restraint and say, "We have general duties and some discretionary duties, and so we must give priority and preference to our general and prime duties." It would be irresponsible of them not to interpret their responsibilities as laid down by the Act. The Minister said that everybody recognised the excellent archaeological services and that they were prized both by the governors and the museum. That is in no doubt. I hope that no one doubts the continuance of the museum's archaeological services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, what is in doubt is what goes and what stays in times of financial restraint. Therefore, quite against the intentions of the Minister and the Office of Arts and Libraries, those services could be diminished and weakened year by year due to cuts in expenditure. Such cuts are not fanciful or theoretical. My hon. Friend drew attention to the public expenditure White Paper which shows that generally expenditure on the arts is being cut. Paragraph 3.13, on page 200, shows that the reduction next year is £20 million, a further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
£8 million the following year and a further £10 million the year after that. We are not talking about theoretical projections. Such cuts are quite likely. The table in paragraph 3.13 shows some encouraging aspects for museums. Central Government expenditure on museums and galleries next year shows a projected increase for some items. I suspect that that takes into account the abolition of the metropolitan counties. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) will see that in 1986–87 there will be a reduction of £1 million of central Government funding on museums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is an acknowledged expert on public finance, so can he say whether the decline in moneys available to the Office of Arts and Libraries is due to the taper following abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils or is it unconnected? If it is unconnected, the cut-off will be even greater. The Government have already announced that money currently provided will be taken away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are already a little wide of the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not reply to that question and stick to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just a question of not replying; I am unable to reply off the top of my head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With due respect to your judgment, Sir Anthony, the realities that will be faced by the archaeological services is relevant to the amendment. We suggest that there should be a statutory power of the same status as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
the general powers outlined at the beginning of the clause. Expenditure will decline. It is difficult to project from the general figures in the public expenditure White Paper what budget the museum will have. I should be surprised if the Minister said now that the Museum of London would be protected from the general dimunition of funds for the arts. If the Minister can assure us that the museum and its governors will be protected because they will no longer be under the benign gaze of the GLC, we shall be greatly reassured. However, I suspect that the Minister cannot and will not give that assurance. It would be wrong for the Minister to protect one museum as against others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governors and the staff will face financial restraints, and I believe that they should interpret their responsibilities as putting secondary importance to archaeology. If anything has to have its budget cut, it should be archaeology rather than those items specified in the general powers. That is why we urge the Minister to reconsider our amendment; if not now, perhaps on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some play on the fact that at least for the first time there will be a statutory function—not an obligation—with regard to the provision of archaeological services. I welcome that small progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
