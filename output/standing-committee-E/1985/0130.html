	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 2, in page 2, line 2, leave out "any" and insert "and".</p>

	<br><q><p>"(2) The Secretary of State may specify in respect of any person that he is an authorised person for the purposes of carrying out an investment business of the kind which falls within any of the paragraphs in Part II of Schedule I but not in respect of the remaining or any of the other kinds of investment business which fall within those paragraphs.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned on Tuesday, we were discussing whether the powers in clauses 59 and 60, which enable the Secretary of State or the designated agency to restrict businesses from engaging in certain kinds of activity, should have the immediate backing of the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two important points underlying our view that that would be unnecessary and undesirable. First, criminal offences should be defined clearly and precisely. Vagueness about the boundaries of a criminal offence should, as far as possible, be avoided. Secondly, criminal offences should not be created unless they are clearly necessary. The amendments would create criminal offences which do not meet either of those tests. As I explained on Tuesday, the boundaries between different types of investment business are inevitably arbitrary and it could be easy unwittingly to stray across the boundary between what was permitted and what was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has yet demonstrated why a criminal offence is needed here. It has not been suggested
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
that the system of rules and the civil and disciplinary sanctions that the Bill provides for breach of such rules are inadequate. The rules will require an authorised person to keep to the activities that he is considered fit to undertake, but there will be effective discipline and civil sanction if he nevertheless undertakes other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) pointed out, the civil and disciplinary sanctions will be underpinned by the criminal law in that, if a person transgresses the rules seriously enough, he will lose his authorisation and will be committing a criminal offence if he then continues to carry on investment business. But that criminal offence will be the straightforward one of carrying on business without authorisation. We believe that that reliance on civil and disciplinary sanctions, with the criminal sanction only as the ultimate back-up, is the best way of achieving that objeotive, which all Committee members agree that they share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has suggested that the Bill should nevertheless give the Secretary of State a reserve power to impose restrictions with criminal penalties for breaching them. He has not given any examples of situations in which such a power might be needed. He appears to have advocated that power on the basis of " You never can tell; it might come in handy sometime." That is not an adequate basis for taking a power with a criminal sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have also raised a number of other matters, including the problems associated with overlapping self-regulating organisations and the absence of a power for a designated agency to fine authorised business. We can discuss those matters more fully when we come to the relevant provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his consideration of the amendment and, as he said, we share the general objective, but I remain unconvinced by his arguments. Having reread what he said at the last sitting, and looked again at the Bill's provisions, I am still struck by the fact that there is nothing in the Bill which empowers the Secretary of State or, eventually, the designated agency, to authorise a person for one kind of investment business to the exclusion of one or more other kinds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that, under clause 10(3), the self-regulating organisation must make a distinction in its rules between those forms of investment business with which it is concerned and those with which it is not. Individuals or organisations will be able to join a number of self-regulating organisations to carry out a range of business. Indeed, I assume that that will be common practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 60 provides the power for the Secretary of State to intervene—after authorisation has been granted—for the purpose of placing restrictions. However, of course, by that time a good deal of damage may have been done. Given that considerable attention is focussed on the problems that will arise by virtue of conflicts of interest, particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
in the new financial conglomerates, surely the Secretary of State should be prepared to take a reserve power—not a mandatory one—to distinguish between one kind of investment business and another in the process of authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is mere prudence to be able to recognise in the form of authorisation that there is a great difference between managing or advising on investments and dealing or arranging investment deals. There is considerable anxiety on this matter, not just among Opposition Members, but in the City. People feel that although in many instances it will be appropriate to allow that range of functions to be performed within the same institution, there should be a power to put up a barrier between those two functions in appropriate cases. If the Bill contained such a power many future difficulties would be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous sitting I said in reply to the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) that we are not talking about the creation of a vague criminal offence. We are talking about the process of authorisation and the conditions on which it is made. Once authorisation is made, there can be no question whether the person or institution concerned is authorised, just as there is no real question under the provisions for authorisation under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 creates an offence of carrying out investment business without authorisation. We are simply talking about the scope of that authorisation, which could be made clear in the authorisation if it were to follow the lines suggested in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's readiness to rely on a somewhat convoluted and elongated process. A person becomes a member of an SRO, breaks its rules by carrying out some other form of investment business, is thrown out of the SRO, becomes de-authorised, and then, by carrying on the business, commits a criminal offence. However, that is a long process in the course of which a great deal of damage could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman entirely understands the matter. The original authorisation by the designated agency or SRO could limit the kinds of investment activity which the person authorised would be entitled to carry out. Therefore, the Bill allows that delineation to be made from the beginning, which, I think, is what the hon. Gentleman seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I invited the Minister to explain last time. So far he has not pointed to the provision that makes that possible. Under clause 10(3), recognised SROs will have to distinguish in their rules between the forms of business in which they are permitted to engage, and those in which they are not. However, I can see nothing that enables the Minister or designated agency to make that distinction in respect of directly authorised people, nor anything that enables him to prevent a given individual or institution from joining several SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
If the Minister thinks that I am still on the wrong point, I shall be grateful if he will point to the provision to which he is referring. Perhaps I ought to give him that opportunity before seeking leave to withdraw the amendments; I do not want to end the debate if there is something further to be said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 45(2)(	<i>a</i>)(ii). Clause 45(1) deals with conduct of business rules. Clause 45(2) reads:
	<br><q><p>" Rules under this section may in particular make provision—
	<ol>
	<li>prohibiting a person from carrying on, or holding himself out as carrying on—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>investment business of any kind specified in the rules; or</li>
	<li>investment business of a kind or on a scale other than that notified by him to the Secretary of State in connection with an application for authorisation under Chapter III of this Part of this Act, in a notice under section 31 above or in accordance with any provision of the rules or regulations in that behalf".</li>
</ol></ol></p></q>
There is a prohibition power in paragraph 	<i>(b).</i> Furthermore, it is contemplaed that authorisation could be limited to certain specified kinds of investment activity in the way in which I understand the hon. Gentleman to be requiring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for drawing my attention to that provision. He is right that that goes someway towards meeting my point. But, as I undersand it, the application of rules to a person once authorised is being described here., I am suggesting that in the process of authorisation, the Minister should have the power to distinguish between authorising for one kind of business and authorising for another. The provision does not appear to deal with my other concern; there is no power for the designated agency or the Secretary of State to prohibit a person or institution from belonging to more than one SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister said, will my hon. Friend accept that there might be a great delay before a self-regulating organisation or the Securities and Investment Board required that a business complied with that provision? We might be talking about a delay of several months, in which time a lot of damage could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks a far earlier and easier solution to a problem that may arise and which we seek to prevent. The Minister does not seem to have taken that on board. Perhaps he can give us an idea of the time scale involved in pursuing his procedure rather than the procedure outlined in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has encapsulated what I am driving at. In our amendment we suggest that from the moment of authorisation it should be made clear to everyone including the authorised person, exactly what business he is entitled to carry out. That ought to take two forms. If he is directly authorised, he should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
be told at that moment that he can be, for example, the manager of an investment fund, but not permitted to deal. Alternatively, if he seeks authorisation by virtue of membership of an SRO, in certain cases he may be told that his authorisation is limited to his membership of that SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what the subsection to which I have referred provides for. Rules may be made under clause 45(2) which would make provision for prohibiting a person from carrying on
	<br><q><p>" investment business of a kind … other than that notified by him to the Secretary of State in connection with an application for authorisation".</p></q>
It may be made plain at the time when an initial application is made for authorisation—precisely the point raised by the hon. Gentleman—that the authorisation is limited to particular kinds of investment activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, while I am on my feet, I may deal with the other point raised by the hon. Gentleman. Of course it is possible for someone to apply to different SROs for authorisation to carry on different kinds of investment business. But he will not be authorised unless he is able to satisfy each SRO that he is a fit and proper person to carry out the particular kind of investment business for which he seeks authorisation from that SRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister's latter comment fully meets my concern. It is quite conceivable that someone may be a fit and proper person for the purposes of one SRO, and, indeed, also be a fit and proper person for another or more than one other, but it is not his fitness and proper-ness, as it were, for those purposes that is my worry. My anxiety concerns the potential conflict of interest that might arise by virtue of that person fulfilling two or more different kinds of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that in many instances such a situation will be the necessary consequence of the structure proposed in the Bill, and the consequence may well be a desirable one, but there will be other instances where it would be thought proper to make a distinction between, for example, managing investments and dealing in the same investments. As I said, I have drawn on City opinion to support my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without disrespect to the hon. Gentleman, I feel that it might be appropriate to deal with such issues on the clause on which the matter rises. If I may say so, clause 1 is not the vehicle for his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should direct his comments to the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Gentleman was making the remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the importation of criminal law into this matter is dealt with by the point that I made in our proceedings on Tuesday, and also by clause 44 which I do not want to discuss now, as I explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I regard that as a helpful intervention or that the hon. Gentleman's remarks were correctly addressed to me. I suspect that he was sugesting, wrongly—I am sure that I have your authority to say this, Sir Michael—that I had in some way been out of order. I am content to rely on your judgment, Sir Michael, rather than on interventions from the lion. Member for Stafford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to delay the Commitete further on this matter, I maintain that there is a genuine argument here that is causing Opposition Members some anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it will be worth returning to the issue on later clauses, and unless another hon. Member wishes to intervene—?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parting company with my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), I hope that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will not be too apologetic about delaying the Committee as he is, very helpfully, focussing our attention on some key issues which will face us throughout our proceedings. I am not sure that this is the appropriate amendment on which to debate them fully, but it is important that they are " tabled " for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to grapple with the problem of financial conglomerates which are increasingly a feature of the financial services industry; they are of great benefit and we do not wish to drive them away from the City of London or from these shores. It is important that when we are debating the best way to regulate these big beasts of the financial jungle we should always recognise the immense benefits that they confer—in mobilising investment capitai on a large scale; in improving living standards for the people of this country; and in their impact on the balance of payments and on the wider provision of pensions. They bring benefits to everyone in Britain and not simply to those who happen to work in the square mile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, despite all those benefits, financial conglomerates pose formidable problems of regulation and policing. In listening to the hon. Member for Dagenham I sometimes wondered whether he wished that the conflicts of interest that are unavoidable, given the existence of financial conglomerates, were somehow not there. Our problem is that we must face their existence and find a way of dealing with them without at the same time undermining the possibility of financial conglomerates staying in business and conferring the benefits to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our best starting point is to recognise that conflicts of interest will be inevitable. I was a little worried about some of the remarks that the hon. Gentleman made on Tuesday about Chinese walls. Chinese walls are, of course, an insufficient protection; the system becomes flawed and fallible all too easily when it is put into practice. Nonetheless they are one of the important defences available to us in dealing with conflicts of interest. The City has a good record of maintaining them as a useful method of investor protection, and while we should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
do all that we can to reinforce and buttress them, and to find additional means of protecting investors, I hope that we shall not almost cynically let it be supposed that we regard them as worse than useless, or as a hollow or flimsy pretence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary will share with us some of his thoughts about the appropriate pattern of investor protection by self-regulating organisations. The Bill provides an essential safeguard: the Secretary of State will not be able to delegate his powers to die designated agency and the sub-structure of SROs until he is satisfied that their intended pattern of proceeding would protect investors. But it would be helpful to know more about the appropriate terms of reference. By what criteria would die Secretary of State judge whether a proposed scheme of SROs was satisfactory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the question of multi-functional regulation, on which die hon. Member for Dagenham has already focused our attention. It would seem desirable for die designated agency to lay considerable emphasis on SROs having a functional basis. I appreciate the force of die argument that we do not want a proliferation of SROs. The web would become unduly complicated and administrative difficulties would be caused for all concerned. There would be problems in finding enough people of quality, ability and recognised standing to man a large number of SROs. However, there is another set of arguments that I think are worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be less convenient for die financial con glomerates and everyone else if we insisted that they should be authorised in respect of the different sorts of business that they transact by SROs each regulating a defined type of investment. It is true that we have the stock exchange, the National Association of Security Dealers and Investment Managers and die Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers, and that those bodies already cover a wide range of functions. We must take the world as it is, and I understand the SIB's desire to get everyone quickly into an SRO. However—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to continue at some length so that I could try to discover how relevant his remarks were to the amendment. However, he is now going very wide, and a number of the points that he is raising are directly related to later parts of the Bill. I think that we should keep fairly narrowly to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to assist both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and focus the patience for which they are both renowned—and for which they will become increasingly renowned during the weeks and months ahead of us?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham mentioned conflicts of interest. That will be dealt with in chapter V of the Bill, which lays down die conduct of business rules which deal specifically with that point.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Chapter III, which is headed " Autiiorised Persons", deals fully with the self-regulating organisations and the circumstances in which they will be recognised by die designated agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept your guidance, Sir Michael. I think that it is important to know the background to the Minister's view on how we can satisfactorily set about regulating multifunctional financial conglomerates. Should we establish conglomerate SROs to deal with a whole range of investment functions? Or should we have particular SROs dealing with specific functions, which would help to differentiate between the various activities of the financial institutions that concern us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has said, understandably, that we have been debating a probing amendment which will not necessarily be put to die vote. But I hope that the Minister shares the view of Opposition Members that a substantial point of principle is involved. Perhaps it would be more elegant to bring the matter up later; no doubt it will come up again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point of principle relates to the central question of the level to which the Government—and the Minister—are prepared to get involved to ensure that the regulations are appropriately, speedily and flexibly put into operation. The aspect that interests me is the reserve power. The Minister will rue the day if that part of the Bill is left as it stands, because of the fluid situation that will develop in the City after the big bang.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not find die Minister's reasons for not strengthening the wording—if not precisely in the form suggested, at least in some form—very convincing. Indeed, I thought that the Minister's attitude tended towards complacency—admittedly rather a strong word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will take the issue seriously when it comes up later. I hope that the Minister will consider how he can put some of our concerns into affect in an amendment which will strengthen clause 1(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My only fear is that smaller businesses may be obliged to join several SROs. The fees likely to be charged are not small. We are talking about approximately £12,500 a year per SRO, which could impose a considerable burden on small firms engaging in a wide range of activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press my earlier point. Will the Minister tell us how long he expects proceedings for compliance with rules to take in the courts? Is there not a possibility that, by the use of delay, people might be able to- continue to practise?

about the nature of what his hon. Friends are urging on the Committee. It is the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) who urges the introduction of the courts. I am suggesting that we do not need the introduction of the courts at this stage. They are there to deal with the criminal offence of an investment business being carried on without any authorisation. The courts are not needed if someone carries on one kind of investment business which he may not be authorised for, when he is authorised to carry out another kind of investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question of time, I have made it clear that it is possible for the authorisation to be limited ab initio. When initial authorisation is granted it is possible to limit it to certain types of investment activity. It is also possible for the self-regulating organisation to take speedy action to enforce its rules. It should be very quick, although I cannot say whether it will be days or weeks. There should be no difficulty; indeed, difficulties would arise if reliance were placed on the courts to enforce the provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the Minister's concluding remark although, under the provisions of clause 3, one must rely on the courts if a criminal offence is committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of our discussion has been at cross purposes but nevertheless I express my gratitude to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). He was corect in saying that these are important issues. The emergence of international financial conglomerates is inevitable; indeed, it is probably desirable. We do not want to handicap the City of London in any major way in maintaining its competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the emergence of those institutions gives rise to major problems of conflict of interests. I should not like it to be thought that I implied that Chinese walls were unnecessary or ineffective. The principle of Chinese walls is important; they should be in place. But I question whether, in some circumstances, they will be adequate. I suspect that in some cases they will be inadequate; we all know that there are limitations to the effectiveness of Chinese walls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw on the support of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and of my hon. Friends in saying that the purpose of the amendment is to make it possible in some circumstances not to place reliance on Chinese walls but on real walls. From the outset the authorisation procedure should make that distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Prison walls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may eventually get to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's argument on clause 45 and the process of direct authorisation. I shall return to the possibility of prohibiting membership of more than one self-regulating organisation when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
we reach that part of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 5, leave out "(whether there or elsewhere)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is even more of a probing amendment. It was prompted by anxiety expressed to me by the nascent International Securities Regulatory Organisation, which has pointed out that the presence in clause 1 of " (whether there or elsewhere)" is intended to ensure that a person who has low presence in the United Kingdom but who, nevertheless, is deemed to carry on an investment business in this country, will be brought within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see what the draftsmen are driving at, but, bearing in mind the strictures of those who expressed alarm at the possibility of criminal offences being evaded, there is a vague area around what constitutes carrying on a business in the United Kingdom if there is no presence in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a person gives advice in New York or Geneva about investments generally, which happens to include a recommendation that ICI shares should be bought. Is that person carrying on an investment business in this country? It is important that we should know—and even more important that the financial community should know —the precise limits of that doctrine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ISRO is fearful, purely from an organisational viewpoint, that the provision may promote a raft of applications from international or foreign organisations that have no real connections with, or intention of doing business in, this country, but which nevertheless fear that they might commit a criminal offence, unless they become authorised. ISRO fears that in, such an uncertain situation, it will be bothered with the fringe and peripheral applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important because, as we know, failure to become authorised involves a criminal liability and unenforceable contracts on the part, perhaps, of straightforward United Kingdom persons and institutions, who believe that they are dealing with a person authorised to make the deal. The Bill is therefore imposing a burden, not only on ISRO and foreign institutions, but on United Kingdom institutions, which may even find that they run the risk of collaborating in a criminal offence or, at the very least, of making deals that are unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may also be problems of extraterritoriality. I can be no more specific than that and the Minister may wish to comment on the point. We find the attempted extraterritorial effects of some American legislation very offensive. Does the Minister foresee any attempt to impose criminal liability on people who are not within this country's jurisdiction? On one reading of the provision, that would be a consequence, so that, to' carry out a business in the United Kingdom, without a presence here and without authorisation, would be a criminal offence.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
I wonder how that provision would be enforced without having extraterritorial effects. I hope that the Minister will comment on the presumed distinction between carrying out a business in this country arid having a physical presence here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) because there is anxiety about the inclusion of activities of such bodies as ISRO, at least in respect of their dealings on the international bond market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of us have had discussions with ISRO and, on looking at the list of its members, I cannot see that any of them would be such unsophisticated investors as to need the sort of protection that other domestic consumers of investments—if I may use that phrase—might require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, protection may be required if a domestic retail market in international bonds, such as Eurobonds, is developed. The international bond market is largely self-regulating—its presence in London is a convenient accident of history—but I am not sure that it needs the sort of regulation that we would otherwise wish to impose on domestic investors in this country. We would appreciate the Minister's comments on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, had some reservations about how the provision was expressed, and I hope that the Minister can help us. Basically, we are dealing with where the contract is entered into. Is the lex situs stipulated in the contract? When one is dealing with international commodities or complicated matters covered by modern means of telecommunication, it is often difficult, because of the speed at which those means operate, to know where and when the contract is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar problems arose in respect of the Data Protection Act 1984. Perhaps the Minister and his advisers could look at that Act which, as I recall, includes provisions dealing with similar matters. Otherwise, there may be difficulty and people may be inhibited from coming to our markets for fear of being caught when they should not be. The matter should be dealt with by the advisers and lawyers of the people who are contracting, so that their standard terms and conditions make the position clear. That seems to be the main point. I imagine that similar difficulties have already arisen and that the Inland Revenue has had to ask where a person in fact carries on a business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore (Hackney, South and Shore-ditch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled about the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and should like to know his reasons for putting it forward. What he has posed as a problem is a virtue. Of course it matters where a contract is made, just as it matters in criminal law where a crime is committed. The more we can say that a crime has been committed in England, the wider the scope we give the crminal authorities. Equally* the more we are able to say that the contract is carried out under English law in England, the wider the scope and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
opportunities for regulation we give the authorities set up in the Bill. That provides a wider protection for the investor under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall name no names, but I have put a case before the Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the fraud squad where there is the clearest possible evidence of crime. The cheque involved in a theft was signed in south Wales, the bank account was held in the Isle of Man, and part of the deal relating to the incident took place in die south of France.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an incident could occur not in relation to a crime but in relation to a regulatory activity with regard to these bodies. It helps rather than hinders people and protects investors rather than causes problems for big companies if we can bring them within the regulatory jurisdiction. It is helpful in cases where we cannot determine whether a contract is signed in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, which is a constant worry in these cases. I must ask my hon. Friend why he has proposed the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment illustrates one of our difficulties—the fact that we do not have the draft conduct of business rules. Those rules may help to clarify the circumstances in which investment business will be subject to the provisions of the Bill. The amendment also touches on an important point, which is the extent to which the Bill governs investment business in the United Kingdom and what that means in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise County Bank, one of the members of ISRO, and it has given me several examples:
	<br><q><p>" The overseas subsidiaries of our group may from time to time do business with or for clients and counterparties in the United Kingdom. For example, our Hong Kong broker/dealer might execute an order for a UK pension fund in a Hong Kong stock; or our Japanese investment advisory company, via the UK-based County Investment Management, might give advice about investing the portfolio of a UK-based client. It appears that under the provisions of the Bill these companies would need to be authorised persons, and would be subject to Conduct of Business Rules, either those of the SIB or those of the relevant SRO. Presumably the Conduct of Business Rules will be so drafted as to make it clear that they do not apply to that part of the business of an authorised person which is conducted outside the UK with non-UK clients or counterparties. This is an issue of some importance, and it would be helpful if the government could clarify what it intends."</p></q>
Surely it is right that if the business is done outside the UK with non-UK clients it will not be subject to the Bill, even though the person doing the business is considered an authorised person under the Bill. It would be helpful if my hon. and learned Friend could clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises a difficult and important point. The difficulty can be seen by the wide range of opinions expressed on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the definition of carrying on investment business in the United Kingdom is broad, and it needs to be. If investors here are to be adequately protected we must not make it easy for a business
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
that operates here to escape the Bill's controls simply by moving its physical base overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, if the United Kingdom is to preserve its reputation as a clean place in which to do business, we must ensure that businesses located here are subject to the Bill's provisions when dealing with investors overseas as well as United Kingdom investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear on Second Reading, I am eager to receive representations about ways in which the Bill might be improved. Some suggestions have been made this morning about how the scope of the clause may go too far. Hon. Members will appreciate that much of the business that is done using facilities provided by the United Kingdom is done entirely by overseas businesses on behalf of overseas clients. That business is not done with ordinary investors in the United Kingdom but with established investment businesses, banks, institutions and others, and is very valuable to the balance of payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concern that if overseas businesses entering into such transactions were required to be authorised it could divert valuable business from this country. The Government therefore intend to propose an amendment that will exclude certain transactions entered into here by overseas businesses. We do not propose to allow such businesses to deal freely with ordinary United Kingdom investors without authorisation. That would open up an unacceptable loophole. But it would be reasonable to exclude transactions with authorised persons in their capacity as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some might suggest that we should go further and exclude also transactions with financial institutions which do not require authorisation and other so-called professional investors, such as the corporate treasuries of large companies. That raises more difficult questions, and I shall be keen to hear what members of the Committee and others think about these matters so that we can better assess and weigh the arguments when we draft the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to specific points raised, the example cited by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) whereby an investment business in New York might, in the course of discussions with clients located in the United States, advise them to include ICI shares within their portfolio, would not come within the present scope of the Bill. There would be no need for any authorisation in relation to such transactions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised to hear the Minister say that, but I am nevertheless relieved that that is the case. However, can the Minister explain why it is so? What in the Bill excludes that type of activity from the definitions in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the investment business is in New York and the client is in New York, simply advising the inclusion of a share that happens to be in the United Kingdom would not constitute
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
	<br><q><p>" the carrying on of business in the United Kingdom "</p></q>
—the phrase used in clause 1(2). The difficulty arises if, in the course of carrying out investment business in the United States on behalf of a United States client, the share is purchased in the United Kingdom. We shall welcome the views of members of the Committee and others on that difficulty to enable us to frame a satisfactory definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have carefully considered clause 1 in relation to extraterritoriality—to deal with another point raised by the hon. Member—and we are satisfied that it does not have extraterritoriality of the kind to which we object in the legislation of other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) raised an important point. Clause 161(3) contains a power which enables different provisions to be made for different cases. That subsection would enable different provisions to be made for dealings between those whom I might loosely term " professionals" in this context, and at this early stage in our proceedings. They would not need as much protection as an ordinary United Kingdom investor without the same sophistication, expertise or experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has of course been in our minds. We have anticipated it and made provision for it in the Bill. However, I am grateful to my hon. Friends and to Opposition Members for having raised these difficult points, which we shall consider carefully when we table a further amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to clause 161(3). Instead of the Government tabling an amendment, could we not await experience? The Secretary of State might then make the changes suggested in the amendment by means of regulation, as laid down in that subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that would be an entirely satisfactory way of dealing with the matter. The definition in clause 1 is fundamental to the whole scope of the legislation, and to the entire system that we envisage. Although clause 161(3) provides a valuable element of flexibility, we are anxious to get the basic definition right in clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that as the Bill progresses the Minister will often be tempted to give way to reasonable pressure from hon. Members for it to be watered down by means of amendments. Could not the important subsection that he has mentioned be used as a delaying mechanism, allowing the Minister reserve powers to deal with matters as and when they arise? While the Minister will no doubt wish to dilute the opinion that I am forming, I sense that he may be inclined to make concessions which we may subsequently cause to regret. With the passage of time and experience, however, he would perhaps deal with the matter differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) has considerable experience of these matters, as we all know. He has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
expressed the fear that we may be acting precipitately. Should we be moving so fast before the Bill has even reached the statute book?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman accuse me of moving " so fast" when all that I have said is that at some stage I shall table an amendment to deal with the problem. The pressure to which the hon. Gentleman fears that I may accede originated in this debate from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our present difficulty illustrates a problem that we shall face throughout the Bill: that of striking the right balance between proper regulation and protection and a degree of flexibility which will enable London to continue its great role as one of the world's leading financial centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to an amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I said at the beginning of our proceedings that it was important for us to look at the Bill as objectively as possible. I do not think that because my hon. Friend moves an amendment it should be assumed either in the Committee or outside that that is necessarily the position that we have taken on a party basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we proceed with the Bill, my hon. Friend will table amendments to secure debate on issues of importance. Like the rest of us, he will wish to scan the list of amendments to see whether they have been placed by the Minister or by his hon. Friends, but it would be wrong to seize upon what has been tabled as a probing amendment and to use that as a justification for what I must describe as a watering-down amendment to be tabled by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to get to his feet now to accept the spirit in which we table such amendments. If he does not do so, the effect will be to restrict the form and nature of my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not only accept that spirit; I embrace it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 162 "partnership" is defined to include:
	<br><q><p>" a partnership constituted under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom".</p></q>
I spoke earlier about where the contract is made. It is important, as we shall constantly find people weighing up whether they want to come to our markets. As my hon. and learned Friend said, we want to encourage them to come here. If we also move in the direction of limited partnerships it is possible that the matters now under discussion should be considered to decide whether the partners in the partnership are joint and several or whether the relationship is with associates abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave that point to my hon. and learned Friend and his advisers for consideration in the context of who will come to our markets, and the people with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
whom they will be dealing. It is not simply a question of contractual relationships—it may affect partnerships also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would not like us to debate clause 162 now. We are getting dangerously near to doing so. Early debates are always difficult because they establish basic principles, and reference has to be made to many other matters at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always my ambition—I may not always get it right—to allow a reasonable debate, but I must remind hon. Members that other debates on specific issues will take place later in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a matter of degree, and obviously examples have to be produced to fortify general examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would you allow me, Sir Michael, to say that a similar argument applies to the definition of a " body corporate " in clause 162? It is inevitable that the Bill will govern both bodies corporate and partnerships outside the United Kingdom. I was describing an example of an overseas subsidiary of a UK group which is an authorised business, because it does business in the UK. I asked my hon. and learned Friend to confirm that the conduct of business rules will make it clear that, when a business which is based overseas, but is, none the less, an authorised business, does business essentially overseas, it will not be subject to the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respond briefly to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I cannot give him the assurance he seeks, because, as he pointed out, the conduct of business rules are not available in the degree of detail that would enable me to give him an assurance. I have no doubt that his question will be considered as the rules are drawn up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said I moved this as a probing amendment, and I am sure that the Committee will become accustomed to my hon. Friends and myself doing this from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our justification is that we have had a useful debate on what is widely agreed to be an important point. I should not like it to be thought, as I suspect that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) thinks, that in moving the amendment I was suggesting that the Eurobond market should not be fully regulated. I should say the reverse. Many of the most worrying cases of security dealing have arisen in the Eurobond market which has hitherto been unregulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support my hon. Friend's general contention that the criminal law, so far as it deals with frauds, thefts and so on, should cover the widest possible ambit. There is nothing between us on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled. Can the hon. Gentleman give an instance of a problem arising in the Eurobond market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my purpose at this stage to go into great detail. I rest my remark on the universal view that this area has caused problems, and regulation is long overdue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch. He and I would again be at one in looking to the Bill not to reduce the scope of the criminal law generally in such matters, but to provide rules that are effective in regulating and authorising the provision of financial services in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was worth raising the general scope of clause 1 because there is a genuine area of difficulty here. To make the rules more effective we must know their scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one comment by way of example. The Minister rightly pointed to the difficulty of an American advising on the purchase of UK shares bought in this country. He said that in that difficult situation we should need to know which side of the rules such a situation fell. The problem is immensely complicated. I am advised by the stock exchange that much of the business done in New York in UK shares—a great volume of business is done there—is by virtue of depositary receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the business is eventually carried out in reality by the purchase of shares on the UK securities market. In other words, there is a market for depositary receipts in New York but their conversion into equities is carried out in the United Kingdom. If that is so, it illustrates the complexity of some of these issues. I raise the matter not for the purpose of arguing that it should fall one side or the other of whatever line is eventually drawn, but to show that such issues are immensely complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the Minister say that the Government would table an amendment on the matter—on Report, I assume. In general terms— in relation to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) made—although I see the point he was driving at, we criticise the Government for delaying making their intentions clear in legislative provisions, even to the extent of not yet having got their mind clear on the matter. I should rather see those matters dealt with in the Bill then left to vague regulatory powers that might be exercised in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with this warning. I am entirely with my hon. Friends when I say that I moved amendment No. 4 to probe the Government's mind. When the Government's mind is revealed and the promised amendment has been tabled we shall examine it carefully and critically to make sure that the proper scope of this provision and the whole scope of the legislation is not wrongly restricted and that the effect of the Bill is not watered down in any way.

In the United Kingdom we are anxious to maintain the tradition of London as a great market centre for the world. The expression " the big bang " has been used and it is one of my primary intentions to discover whether that will turn out to be a new galaxy, or a black hole. There have been difficulties in respect of the markets and we must put the matter right if, through the mechanism provided in the Bill, we want to enable those people, who want to come to our markets, to continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London commodity exchange, which engages in the activities of the commodities markets throughout the world, goes back to the 16th century, if not before, and to Gresham's exchange and 'the East India company. Much of this country's prosperity has been built up on those markets which have centred on London, and we do not want them to go away. We want to ensure that the Bill does not inhibit people from coming to our markets.

I endorse Committee Members' views that we must ensure that we do not have fraud, that the markets are properly regulated and that people are properly authorised on a voluntary, self-regulating

basis, with appropriate back-up powers from the Secretary of State and the SIB. But we must ensure that the markets are properly organised in a sensible manner to ensure that people come here, as they have in the past. I intend to explain the difficulties facing the commodities markets to illustrate those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what is the source of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had explained that the source of the amendment is the London commodity exchange, which recently asked me to table a probing amendment—I did not draft it—so that we can engage the interest of the Minister and his advisers in the matter. A number of important points arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no connection, direct or indirect, with the London commodity exchange, but it is important that matters of genuine interest to the viability of our markets should be properly examined. Let me quote from an article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 14 January 1986:
	<br><q><p>" Commodity markets have recently been very quiet and London is having difficulty holding market share. Unless urgent action is taken, members' reserves will continue to be at risk."</p></q>
That was the opinion of Mr. Saxon Tate. The article continues:
	<br><q><p>" Mr Saxon Tate, the recently-appointed full-time chairman of the London Commodity Exchange, has launched his attempt to restructure the UK's principal soft commodity futures markets".</p></q>
It is not a task to be under-estimated. Mr Saxon Tate has just come from the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board. The article continues:
	<br><q><p>" Mr Tate's initiative comes at a crucial time. For most of last year, the Exchange's contracts were suffering a sharp decline in both volume and international market share."</p></q>
The article quotes Mr. Tate as writing that
	<br><q><p>" The assumptions made about the possibility of developing new business are very challenging, though essential, not only in terms of financial contribution but to London's continued existence as a major international market place for soft commodities."</p></q>
In an article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 4 October 1985, Mr. Saxon Tate said:
	<br><q><p>" it worries me and saddens me when I hear about business leaving London."</p></q>
The article continued:
	<br><q><p>" He believes it is essential to boost the currently depressed trading volumes on the exchange".</p></q>
Later the article reported that Mr. Saxon Tate believed that the key factors were first, the cost, and secondly, the regulatory environment. Mr. Saxon Tate accepted that regulation would come and said:
	<br><q><p>" Regulation can be used to improve the climate of the marketplace, and it's likely to be better and cheaper if the City does it itself."</p></q>
The article adds that Mr. Saxon Tate
	<br><q><p>" recognises that the LCE does not have unlimited time to put its house in order."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
That is a frank and responsible statement by someone at the centre of an important market which goes back several hundred years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article entitled:
	<br><q><p>" London's commodity markets—Why the future may not work "</p></q>
says:
	<br><q><p>" When the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established by the Government to regulate the industry some ten years ago there was jubilation in London."</p></q>
That jubilation proved rather transparent. The article continues:
	<br><q><p>" It was widely forecast that the increased rules and regulations imposed by the CFTC would deter many users of the markets and drive business across the Atlantic.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Instead exactly the opposite happened. It was found that properly regulated markets were an attraction, especially to newcomers to futures like the financial institutions which were accustomed to dealing in regulated stock exchanges."</p></q>
What it boils down to is the fact that on
	<br><q><p>" The LCE markets are in direct competition with those in the U.S., mainly in New York, and are under the greatest pressure."</p></q>
The object of the Bill is to ensure a fraud-free market place in London. On the evidence I cited, far from driving people away, that aim is likely to attract people, providing that regulation is effected so that it does not become a straitjacket but creates the right sort of balance and climate. I have 15 years' experience of dealing with self-regulatory organisations and I believe that the Bill is remarkable in that it strikes such a balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to set the scene for our discussions as it is directly relevant to them. I shall not detain the Committee much longer, but the answers to my questions may affect the amendment, which no doubt requires refinement. It arises because commodity markets are concerned about the notes which define " futures " in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which I did not draft, amends the notes to paragraph 8 of schedule 1. I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to the status of the notes in the schedule for the purpose of interpretation before the courts. Are the notes merely guidance or are they substantive provisions? For example, they qualify what is stated in paragraph 8. When deciding what is or is not investment business, it is important that the courts know the status of the notes. I shall not delay the Committee on this technical matter. The Minister and his advisers will know what I mean and I shall welcome their views on the subject, either in the Minister's reply or subsequently. The answer could affect the important question of what investments and investment businesses mean at law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the amendment is to substitute in the notes to paragraph 8 of schedule 1, a new set of criteria for the expression " futures". It aims to exclude deferred delivery physical contracts, to throw the emphasis back on to note 1, to clarify the words in paragraph 8 itself and to cater for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
assumption that in this provision the Government want to address themselves to futures rather than the normal type of commercial contracts. Perhaps the Minister will indicate his views on the matter in principle and, if need be, give an undertaking to come forward with amendments on Report. On that basis I will not press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the closing observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), perhaps I may be permitted to reply relatively briefly. We are certainly seized of the problem and the general invitation which I extended to members of the Committee and those outside holds good here too. We recognise the difficulties posed by the definition of " futures " for the purposes of the Bill. We recognise that there may be scope for improvement in that definition and we would approach any suggested improvements in a constructive frame of mind. My hon. Friend's amendment would be counter-productive from the point of view of those who suggested the amendment. Perhaps he will be content if I supply him with the detailed reasons why that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. and learned Friend knows, I did not draft the amendment. Secondly, the matter was dealt with somewhat speedily, very recently. Nevertheless, we hope that discussions can continue so that the amendment achieves its objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course discussions can continue. I need not take up the Committee's time by going through the reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be useful if we could have some explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, if the hon. Member for Dageaham (Mr. Gould) wishes that. The position is this: the Bill proposes a distinction in paragraph 8 of schedule 1 between those contracts which are defined as investments and those which are not. As I have mentioned, there are various difficulties in arriving at such a definition. They arise in particular because of the problems in defining in law the difference between a futures contract, into which the parties enter for the purpose of supplying or obtaining the commodity in question at some later date and one which, although it may provide for the delivery and may occasionally take place, is essentially a pricing, hedging or speculative mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To provide guidance on how to decide whether a contract is one made for investment purposes and therefore an investment under the Bill, paragraph 8 of schedule 1 contains six indications. They are expressed as notes. My hon. Friend asked about the status of the notes: they are substantive provisions although those in paragraph 8 of schedule 1 are expressly stated to be indications and therefore perhaps pointers as to which side of the line a contract might ultimately be held to he.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three of those six indications, notes 3(	<i>c</i>), 	<i>(b)</i> and (	<i>c</i>) give guidance on whether the contract is made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
for a commercial purpose and is not an investment. If those three indications are present it would be a strong pointer that the contract was not an investment. Similarly, three indications in note 4 give guidance on whether the contract is an investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of interpretation arises when a contract fails to score three pluses on one note and three minuses on the other. That simply means that the definition is more difficult, but the absence of one or even two of the indications on one side or the other is not conclusive proof of the nature of the contract—they are only pointers. Particular difficulties arise in relation to agricultural contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments delete four of the six provisions, and we are somewhat puzzled how that would add greater clarity to the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also appear to make a significant extension to the coverage of the Bill, which those who proposed the amendment to my hon. Friend may not have intended. That extension would arise from the addition to note 2 which, as amended, would include all contracts made
	<br><q><p>" on the standard terms of a recognised investment exchange".</p></q>
That would bring the contracts into the definition of an investment, even when made off an exchange. We doubt whether those who provided my hon. Friend with the amendment intended that. We are grateful for the amendment, which puts a marker on an important point, one on which we should be grateful for views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was very fair, and that the London commodity exchange was very fair in pointing to the lessons to be drawn from the American regulations introduced about 10 years ago. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the expectation in London then was that dealers and investors would flee the American markets and come to London, where they regarded the regulations as less onerous. However, the opposite has been true. People like to deal in properly regulated markets. That is a lesson that we should all remember and apply throughout our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that commodities are central to international trade and the Third World countries. Stability of supply is central. The object of trading in futures and of dealing in commodities through these markets is to ensure that we have that stability. With modern systems of communications, that has become increasingly more important, as the President of Nigeria has recently stated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman immediately draws our attention to the area where the difficulties arise. We are all aware of the importance of the commodities markets and of the difficulties that arise when one of those markets gets into trouble, as is the case with tin at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to the fact mat a genuine commodity market where the physical goods are traded inevitably becomes, by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
virtue of modern business practices, a market in which future contracts are entered into for the purpose of regulating the market and smoothing out the bumps. That encourages into the market people who are not necessarily interested in trading in physical goods but who use it as a form of speculative investment. It is where we draw the line in that process that produces the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably better to have a longer list of criteria that enables us to get the answers right, and for the onus of proof to remain as it is, rather than to cut down on that list and shift the burden of proof. Therefore, while I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's general objective, we do not think that his amendment provides a better version of the provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman performed a useful service in leading the Minister to say what I had assumed was the case—that the notes were to be regarded as of substantive effect. As that is so I wonder whether the subheading is not at best otiose and at worst misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Committee that our proceedings are not available to the courts, and that it is therefore important that they should be under no misapprenhension over what the note actually means. I do not wish to go into Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes, but this is a very important point which could easily be cleared up by the draftsmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not an interest. I wonder whether you could explain how that comes about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word is "investment", and it is disclosed in clause 1(1). I have taken the best possible advice and I understand that that is the position. This shows that the Chair would be well advised to stick to his rulings rather than creating a debate. But we cannot discuss it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael, I understand that the question does not turn on the word "investment" but on the word
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
"interest". An investment is defined in several ways in clause 1. Subsection (1) defines an investment as
	<br><q><p>"any asset, right or interest falling within any paragraph in part I of Schedule 1 to this Act."</p></q>
The real question is whether a liability is an interest, and whether by being included in schedule 1 it is automatically included in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of Lloyd's is an important matter of principle to me and to others. It would be useful, Sir Michael, to have a little more flesh on the bones so that we could understand your thinking and perhaps frame our amendments in future so that they meet with your approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I can see why you think the amendment of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. But I am not prepared to allow long points of order on this particular matter, because we have passed that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to go into detail about my future rulings. We are at the beginning of our proceedings, gradually working our way into them. I have given the matter the utmost consideration and taken the best possible advice. The amendment could easily have been drafted in such a way that it clearly referred to an interest, but I am advised that it does not do so as it stands. I am not prepared to say any more. I trust that what the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has said will be taken on board by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

which are to be included within the definition of investments. Note 1 following says that certain contracts of insurance which meet four criteria are excluded from the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some long-term insurance contracts are clearly investments. An obvious example is an endowment insurance attracting major profits with a benefit payable after 10 or 20 years and giving a capital sum to someone who is still alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there are contracts like permanent health insurance, accident insurance, and

whole-life insurance with the benefit payable only on the death of an individual to another person— probably his dependant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latter group includes the insurance contracts designed for the protection of an individual, and common sense does not suggest that they are investments. I appreciate that, at the margin, the distinction is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise the difficulty and are keen to ensure that the line is drawn in the right place. I have tabled my amendment as a probing amendment to ensure that we do so, and do not include within the definition—just because they happen to be for fixed terms of more than 10 years— contracts which most ordinary people would not see as investments but as protection for the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there is in the group an Opposition amendment in similar terms to amendment No. 5, suggesting a similar provenance, I shall briefly endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment contains no great questions of principle about the scope of the Bill but is designed to deal with an awkward definitional point, rather similar to the one we debated on the previous amendment. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield was right to say that it was presumably not the intention of the Bill's draftsman to bring within it contracts for insurance which are in no sense investments. The simple criterion of length of term may be inappropriate or too tightly drawn, and may sweep into the net of the Bill some contracts that are for protection rather than investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will sympathise with our general aim. It is possible that the amendment is not drafted in the best way to achieve our purpose, but will the Minister say if whether he thinks that the Bill as drafted does so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse everything that has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I presume that it is the Government's intention to exclude policies that are purely for protection, as opposed to policies possessing the characteristics of an investment, at least in part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy to formulate such definitions entirely satisfactorily. I certainly welcomed the former Secretary of State's response to an intervention that I made on Second Reading—although it was wrongly attributed by 	<i>Hansard</i> to my hon and learned Friend the Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Spencer). Such is life!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment No. 47 seeks to supplement amendments Nos. 5 and 6. My intention is to tighten and improve the scope of the provision. The extra element of definition would be helpful in catching more reliably as investments all policies providing variable benefit or which go further than being mere protection policies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield suggested, I have in mind
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
with-profits or unit-linked policies that have the character of investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example illustrates why I believe that the provision is necessary. Allied Dunbar has recently launched a permanent health insurance policy called the income protection plan. Unlike traditional permanent health insurance policies, which work on the same basis as term assurance—if there is no claim, there is no payout—Allied Dunbar's policy has an investment link. Money that is not required for the purpose of insurance goes into an investment fund and it is expected that there will be a cash value at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not ensure that the definition will catch that type of policy, there may be a loophole which will be exploited by enterprising members of the investment fraternity. My purpose is to try to ensure that our definitions catch policies containing an investment element, while reinforcing the distinction between protection and investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a grey area between the different types of insurance policy that we are discussing under the amendments. Long-term insurance contracts are not, as is sometimes thought, purely contracts involving an element of investment through with-profits endowment or unit trust linked endowments. One argument holds that long-term insurance contracts should include matters such as permanent health insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has worked in an insurance office knows that life policies, whole life policies, endowment policies with and without profits and permanent health insurance contracts are frequently dealt with by the same people within the same department. In my experience over a long period before I entered the House, it is even more usual that when an investment package is sold to a prospective customer, it includes a permanent health insurance contract. That provision ensures that, irrespective of whether the insured lives to the end of the investment period or falls sick in the meantime, there is a reasonable expectation that the investment package will be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases that arrangement means that when an investment package is sold as a with-profits endowment policy it includes a permanent health contract as a similar or, some would say, equal, part of the package. Such packages are different from annually renewable accident and sickness policies. Like life policies, such packages cannot be cancelled by the company until the event insured against occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investor—the customer—can cancel an endowment policy simply by choosing not to pay a renewal premium. The same rule applies to permanent health insurance contracts. Both types of policy are linked by the fact that they cannot be cancelled by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that exent, an endowment with profits or an endowment linked to the product of a unit trust seem to be similar to permanent health insurance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
contracts. There is a fair argument for including in the ambit of the Bill not only endowment with profits policies but also permanent health insurance contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) implied that whole life policies could not be considered as investments because they were pure protection. If I misunderstood my hon. Friend no doubt he will correct me. That argument can be sustained only up to a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many whole life policies which are effected basically for protection are also effected on a with-profits basis. There are light years between the best and worst with-profits whole life policies on the market. So it becomes extremely important that we should be able to look to the person who is trying to sell a whole life with-profits contract to offer die expertise and probity mat are at the heart of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the amendments for various reasons, although I appreciate that they are only probing amendments. First, as permanent health insurance contracts are so frequently offered as part of a package, the other parts of which clearly are investment, there may be an argument for including permanet health insurance within the ambit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, although whole life policies are principally aimed at providing protection in the event of death, more often than not they are issued on a with-profits basis. Surely that implies an element of investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) have correctly identified the Government's purpose in this matter, which is to distinguish what may loosely be called investment policies from what may equally loosely be called protection policies. They have also suggested correctly that the line that has been drawn may not necessarily be the best. Again, we are open to- representations on that, but neither of the alternative fines suggested in the amendments would improve matters and it might help, certainly in terms of further representations, if I said why we take that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) tabled amendment No. 5 and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) tabled a very similar amendment both of which seek to change the definition in three significant respects. First, it removes the existing criterion that the term of the contract should be for 10 years or less. The effect of that would be to remove from the definition of investment, provided that the other criteria were satisfied, whole life policies and term policies taken out in circumstances that amount to whole life, such as 100-year term policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One motive for taking out whole life policies, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) has just pointed out, is to make an investment. Whole life policies are frequently suggested by financial advisers as a way of accumulating a sum to be set against tax liabilities on death, so we would not wish to exclude them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
Secondly, the amendment would possibly include as an investment a policy that paid out on death or disability benefits which were not predetermined and specified. It is difficult to see why that should be so. If such a policy related the amounts to be paid to the profits of a company or to units in a unit trust, it does not seem that for that reason alone it should be included as an investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the amendment provides that a policy that provided on surrender for a return of premiums plus interest might not be regarded as an investment. The limit on surrender values was designed to prevent people from evading the Bill by selling a policy that appeared to be a pure protection policy but in fact provided an investment return realisable on surrender. That is similar to the example that was cited in the discussion on the paragraph in the schedule. The amendment would exclude from the definition of investments such a policy. A number of insurance policies that are generally regarded as investments could be expressed in terms of premiums plus interest, such as endowment policies without profits, and some friendly society policies, the benefits under which are linked to building society rates. So, for those three reasons, the Government do not take the view that the amendments would provide a better demarcation line than that identified in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) tabled amendment No. 47, which, I understand, seeks to be an improved version of amendment No. 5. It seeks to reduce the scope of the exclusion from being an investment, by making it clear that certain types of policies are always investments. It is, to some extent, an improvement on the previous suggestion, but it has three defects: in some respects it does not go far enough; in other respects, it goes too far; and, on the whole, it is not sufficiently clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may regard those as minor defects, but let me explain them in more detail. First, the amendment still does not go far enough. As I explained before, our intention is to exclude from being investments only those policies whose purpose is protection and which have no other purpose. At that point, I part company from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who explained his view in his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person who buys a policy with a surrender value which consists of the return of premiums with interest is not just interested in protection, as such a policy contains an investment element. If the policy was only for protection, the only proper surrender value would be a sum related to premiums already paid that cover a portion of unexpired risk. As I said, we are considering the paragraph again, and will give further attention to surrender values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment goes too far because, in narrowing the exclusion, it has increased some policies as investments that should not be so included. For example, a term policy, bought solely for protection purposes, could have its benefits linked to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
the retail price index to preserve its real value; yet such a contract would fall within class 3 of schedule 1 to the Insurance Companies Act 1982 and so would not benefit from the exemption as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the point of clarity, we are anxious to draw the line as firmly as possible, and to try to avoid words and phrases whose interpretation is not precise; the line marks, after all, the boundary of a criminal offence. The amendment uses the concept of a with-profits policy. Although that is a term widely used in the insurance industry, I am doubtful whether it is capable of precise definition; it is almost another way of saying that the policy is an investment one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not pretend that the line presently drawn in the Bill is ideal, and I shall remain open to representations about how to improve it, I cannot commend to the Committee the suggested improvements in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the point raised by my hon. and learned Friend, in respect of the drafting of amendments and a number of matters which have cropped up continually in the proceedings. It does not help the Committee if amendments are not in the shape and form which enable us to consider them as well as possible. One point, in respect of the difficulty faced by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has occurred to me from time to time, and I gave evidence on the matter to the Select Committee on Public Bill procedure: it is not difficult for people to prepare themselves well in advance so that amendments can be tabled in the proper shape and form. All Committee members share a genuine wish in that respect, because it would enable us to consider matters properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take up the point made by my hon. and learned Friend, we genuinely want the Bill to be in the best possible shape because it is important to the future of our markets in the City. In a sense, I am making a plea to those outside to ensure that we have proper briefings and amendments. We can then consider the matter properly, and not simply play a game of ping-pong, passing the ball back to the Minister now and again, to obtain another opportunity to consider the matter on Report, yet not having had the opportunity to consider matters as deeply as the Bill requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) has made a useful suggestion, and I am encouraged by the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Minister. As he says that he has the same purposes as the hon. Members who tabled the amendments, will he undertake to receive further representations on that point and to bring back an amendment which will fulfil our purposes in a form more satisfactory to himself and his advisers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press my hon. and learned Friend the Minister a little further on the matter of whole life policies without profits. The general trend of the discussion appears to be that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
those policies are not investments. But if the Minister were confronted as a prospective customer by someone who was offering a range of whole life policies in which the estimated return on death would be substantially different for the same premium, would he not expect that salesman to possess certain knowledge about the investment approaches of the various insurance companies? Surely he would wish to be told what was a good or bad investment and whether to invest, say, £100 in companies A, B, or C. That would amount to relying on advice that comes close to investment advice. How does the Minister see the issue of important issue of whole life, non-profit policies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), I wonder whether my hon. and learned Friend would also comment on permanent health insurance contracts. They are non-cancellable by the insurance company, which simply pays benefit if the insured person falls sick. However, when the benefits payable either weekly or as a lump sum are linked to the product of an investment in a unit trust, they come close to requiring a judgment, not on insurance but on investment policy. Therefore, they, too, should be included in investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would give us his view on whole-life, without-profits policies and non-cancellable permanent health policies where they are linked to an investment medium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). Since he put the question to me on a personal level, there are many transactions in which I as a customer would expect to obtain advice from the salesman who was endeavouring to sell me a particular product. That applies to many commodities, articles and services. The question is whether the advice that I would expect was investment advice, which poses the necessity for drawing a line between some services or products and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably the nearer we get to the border the more difficult it will be to decide how a particular product should be defined. For reasons I have given, it is sensible to put protection policies on one side and investment policies on the other. Although those are loose phrases and although it may be difficult at the borders to decide in which category a product comes, the general concept is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his second example, my hon. Friend came close to illustrating how difficult these matters can be. One might readily appreciate that a permanent health insurance policy as conventionally understood would come within the scope of protection policies. If it is linked to unit trusts the problem becomes more difficult and is susceptible to various kinds of treatment. Those are the difficulties that we have been debating today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not another difficulty? In the situation I posed, where a salesman is trying to effect policies on the life of my hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
Friend, the salesman has to be a fit and proper person—under the meaning of the Bill—to recommend to my hon. and learned Friend an endowment with profits, or an endowment linked to unit trusts. But he does not have to be a fit and proper person to offer my hon. and learned Friend as part of the same package, either a whole life non-profit policy or—much closer to the mark—a permanent health insurance contract linked to a unit trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We aim to protect the investor, but are we not putting the prospective customer in an impossible position by saying to him, " You can accept the word of this man when he tries to sell you a policy with profits, but you cannot when as part of the same package he tries to sell you a life policy that is whole life, non-profit"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the last argument put by my hon. Friend does not follow from the first two. It is not a question of saying to the customer, " You can accept the salesman's word in one respect and not in another." Rather, we are saying, " One product is a product that we regard as an investment, in respect of which we think that you are entitled to protection and which we insist on being sold by someone who is fit and proper. The other product we put into a different category. It is net an investment, and you are not therefore entitled to that degree of protection so the person who sells you that product is not required to be authorised as a fit and proper person."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the distinction. Perhaps, however, I can give my hon. Friend some comfort by referring him to clause 45(4) which would allow conduct of business rules to apply to categories of insurance policies that are close to, but just outside, the strict category of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will console my hon. Friend for the otherwise relatively unsympathetic note that I have struck in replying to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much an observer or listener to the debate, although I contributed briefly at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take seriously the argument put by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). If an insurance salesman were to approach the Minister and offer him a range of policies, one of which included whole life cover with profits, would not that salesman, by virtue of that fact alone, have to be an authorised person—quite apart from any other policy that he might offer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends discussed the drafting of the amendments that we have been debating this morning, and the possibility of our making amendments during the Committee stage without waiting for Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detract from the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), but I suggest that a number of the matters that we have discussed this morning and the difficulties that We have encountered arise not simply out of drafting defects in the amendments tabled, but from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
real conceptual difficulties involved in arriving at sensible definitions that are in all respects precisely accurate. It would be well for us to recognise the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise to my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon that the Bill is the product of extensive consultation over a long period. It is important that no impression to the contrary be given. Of course we are eager to continue to consult but as we examine successive clauses of the Bill in Committee, it follows that the Report stage will be the appropriate time to table further amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The conceptional difficulties in the Bill are obvious, but they are also well known to those involved in such markets and services. Hon. Members are frequently asked to deal with questions at short notice. That is far from being the fault of the Minister or his advisers. They have given the matter enormous attention for a long time from the publication of the White Paper, through the Gower report and since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is remarkable, but it is not good enough for people to raise new ideas and to table amendments too late for us to hold a meaningful discussion on matters that are germane to the markets and services of the future. It is not so difficult to get the right advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not take quite such a gloomy view as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). We have had a useful discussion. The comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Minister on the amendments will be studied carefully by those outside the House. I got a gamma minus from my hon. and learned Friend and from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) got a beta minus. There was nothing wrong with his amendment—apart from the fact that it went too far, it did not go far enough and it was not clear. In the circumstances I thought that his mark was rather complimentary.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to meet the fear of several banks that the Bill's existing definition of investments will include many purely banking instruments which are not investments as the word is understood in relation to investor protection. I have in mind certificates of deposit, various kinds of debt instrument with more than five years to run, foreign currency options, forward rate agreements and various kinds of swaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Bill is intended to regulate operations of a purely banking character. The investment activities of banks and their subsidiaries will properly fall within the scope of the Bill. That is not at issue. Some confusion may be caused by bringing dealings in banking operations within the scope of the Bill. The possibility is partially recognised by some of the exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, paragraph 8 of the schedule exempts forward foreign exchange and foreign exchange futures provided that the contracts are made for commercial rather than for investment purposes. That exemption will not be effective because the banks transacting the business will not necessarily know their customers' motives and will be unable to determine whether transactions are entered into for commercial or for investment purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, paragraph 18(2) exempts transactions in certain instruments between banks. That provision is also of limited value because many banks do not have separate dealing rooms for inner-bank activities. The purpose of the amendment is to allow a bank to deal with, for example, the group treasurer of ICI, who is probably at least as well informed, professional and sophisticated as the bank, without the transaction coming within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a problem in that many foreign banks would not be covered by the exclusion in the paragraph. The problem could be overcome by allowing certain parties who regularly undertake such transactions to elect to be excluded from the scope of the Bill. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will be able to advise us that the Government do not intend to bring such activities within its scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that my amendments are necessarily perfect, in the light of what has been said about some of the others. They may exclude rather too many activities. But I would be grateful for an assurance from my hon. and learned Friend that he recognises the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I start by explaining the purpose of the paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognised banks and licensed institutions are already subject to the supervision of the Bank of England. Similarly, the chief registrar of friendly societies supervises building societies. All those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
bodies transact business in the wholesale money markets. The statutory supervision to which they are subject does not extend to that business, but in practice it is subject to non-statutory supervision. Paragraph 18 seeks to avoid wasteful and confusing dual supervision of such activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should perhaps make clear that there are other investments traded on the money market besides the particular debentures specified in subparagraph (3), and other major professional participants in that market. We are giving further thought to the precise wording of the paragraph and may wish to propose amendments later. But the objective of avoiding dual supervision will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments proposed by my hon. Friend would go very much further. First, they would extend the range of persons who could deal with each other without constituting investment business. The paragraph is limited to recognised banks, licensed institutions and building societies; the amendments add all authorised persons, whatever their business, and any person who elects to be treated as authorised for such purposes. That clearly extends the scope of the legislation well beyond the money market, with which, as I have explained, the paragraph is intended to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendments would extend the range of investments which may be dealt in by the specified persons without constituting investment business. The paragraph is limited to debentures of five years' term or less issued by recognised banks, licensed institutions and building societies. The amendments add all debentures issued by one of the persons included on the list, all options written by them and all futures contracts and contracts for differences which they enter into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That approach would open up major loopholes in the Bill. It would mean, for instance, that a bank would not fall within the scope of the Bill in writing a currency option for an authorised person, even if that authorised person was, say, an insurance broker. It would also mean that a futures broker could escape the need for authorisation if he could persuade all his clients, however unused to dealing in futures, to sign a form saying that they wished to be treated as authorised persons for these purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept that there are professional investors who do not need the protections afforded by the Bill, and that we should not seek to impose unnecessary restraints on dealings between such investors. Many of the rules made under the Bill will be aimed particularly at protecting the interests of smaller, less sophisticated investors, but the rules will be able to make different provisions for different cases, as can be seen from clause 161(3), to which I have already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will therefore be possible to disapply such rules in the case of dealings between professional investors, and I believe that to be a preferable approach to the blanket exemptions in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Opposition, with, I am sure, the backing of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), support what the Minister has said. However, I want to emphasise that we find the principle embodied in amendment No. 63 unacceptable. As I understand it, the amendment would make it possible for a person voluntarily to exempt himself from the provisions of the Bill. That is a dangerous principle which could be open to abuse, not necessarily on the part of the person himself but because of pressure put on him. I feel that it is unacceptable and has no place in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the banks were controlled by a statutory supervisory system. I hope that he was not trying to give us the impression that the banking supervisory system was satisfactory. It is run by Mr Rodney Galpin, the executive director of the Bank of England. If his conduct over the past year in his negotiations with Mr Mahmoud Sipra is anything to go by, he ought not to be supervising anything or, indeed, be an executive director of the Bank of England. One of the great pities about the Bill is that the supervision of the Bank of England does not come under a higher authority so that it can be checked and regulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the effect or the intention of the amendment to allow people to opt out of all the provisions of the Bill, only those of paragraph 13. The purpose is simply to draw attention to quite a serious problem. I understand the Government's wish to avoid dual supervision and I welcome my hon. and learned Friend's undertaking to consider this further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our problems is that we are debating this issue without knowing what the rules will be. If we knew that the rules will recognise the special problems of large professional investors who are dealing daily in the money market with as much expertise as the banks, it would not be necessary to raise these issues. I appreciate that that is not necessarily my hon. and learned Friend's thought. I readily acknowledge that my amendments go much wider than the problem that I am trying to deal with. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

The amendment relates to paragraph 19 of schedule 1 which aims to exempt from the definitions of conducting an investment business, the activity of providing—presumably within the facilities of a particular company—facilities whereby the employees of that company or related companies can buy and sell to each other shares in the company or group of companies for which they work.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
It is understandable why the Government have sought to make this exemption, both on practical and possibly on political grounds. It is clear that, by virtue of their privatisation programme, the Government look forward to a great increase in the volume of business done in this way. I do not intend to make the case against that. Indeed, it is possibly worth making the point that the Labour party has a political interest in encouraging worker shareholdings. My difficulties with this provision do not relate to the underlying political debate which is possibly an important contextual factor, but to the practical effect of the scope of the exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption, as drafted, is extremely wide in a number of respects. It embraces not just the employees but a whole range of their relatives. I concede that that follows on from the provisions in the Companies Act. It also embraces a number of companies which are not the direct employer of the people concerned but which are connected in some way. But more worryingly, it brings in a whole range of other investment business which it would be extremely dangerous to leave outside the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a group of people who are likely to be at the far end of the range of potential investors; their means and their investment business will be relatively small. They will be relatively inexperienced and therefore most likely to be in need of advice. They are the complete antithesis of the professional investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of people, which is perhaps rapidly expanding, will have little previous experience of making investments. The exemption leaves them without the protection provided by the Bill. They are also people in the most vulnerable possible situation to make such a decision. They are dealing with people they know, who may be their superiors in the work place. They deal with them in conditions that seem friendly, comfortable, congenial and familiar, which are the very conditions in which they are not likely to recognise that they are making an important investment decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Such people do not have to go to an office or to any particular place to seek advice or to make their purchase; they are being encouraged by this provision to make what might be an important investment decision in the very context in which they are are least able to make an objective judgment. That is another reason for anxiety.

There is a third reason. Not only are such people inexperienced and in a situation where they are particularly vulnerable because of the familiar context, but they may be dealing with people who have almost unequalled possibilities of gaining access to inside information. It is exactly in that situation where employees of a company—a wide term—may have information that is not available to other employees. On that basis there are grave possibilities for exploitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
Having drawn attention to some of those factors, I hope that the Minister and other members of the Committee will recognise that I am not seeking to make a political point; I believe that the exemption will create genuine problems. I am fortified in that view by the fact that it was also a problem identified by, and clearly causing great concern to, Professor Gower. He in turn, relied upon the City capital markets committee, which also had misgivings. In part II of his report at page 19, paragraph 3.08, Professor Gower says:
	<br><q><p>" if the intended result is that deals in such ' shops' are to be totally free from regulation there seem to me to be grave dangers."</p></q>
He goes on to make the point that I have made already that the width of the exemption in terms of the people covered is extremely wide, by virtue of the Companies Act, and adds:
	<br><q><p>" A ' share shop' appears to provide a facility which will enable the more sophisticated and those with unpublished price-sensitive information to deal free from the statutory constraints on insider dealing which apply only to stock exchange deals."</p></q>
That is an immensely powerful piece of testimony which the Government should not overlook when they legislate for such transactions."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that it may be appropriate to make special provision for this type of transaction in this context but, from what I have said, it is clear that there is a premium on the statutorily enforced availability to employees of properly independent advice. That is the purpose of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By all means let us have employee share shops. Let us accept that the mere establishment of such a share shop is not to be regarded as the carrying on of investment business, but let us require as a condition of the exemption that there should in each case be available to employees about to enter into such transactions properly independent advice which, by virtue of the other provisions of the Bill, must be provided by an authorised person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister will accept the force of my argument and the need to deal with the problems, if not specifically in the form suggested in the amendment, at least in a way that will avoid the difficulties to which I have drawn attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends will have enjoyed the delicate way in which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) approached the subject as he walked the tightrope between the various conflicting elements in his party's attitude towards flicting elements in his party's attitude to employee share schemes. I have no need to be equivocal about this; the Government welcomes the growth of employee share schemes. Such schemes underline the close and direct interest that employees have in the fortunes of their employers. But the relatively high costs of dealing in relatively small quantities of shares may mean that the incentive value of such a scheme is less than it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some companies may wish to add to the attractiveness of their schemes by providing facilities to enable employees to trade with each other at a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
lower cost. Indeed, a few companies have already done so. The Government believe that the provision of such facilities should not be discouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to discourage the provision of such facilities. A company could benefit from the exclusion only if those using the facilities provided received advice from an authorised person who was otherwise unconnected with the company. That would increase the costs, for either the employer or the employees, and would be of no obvious benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sale of shares by one employee to another is a private transaction, and nothing in the Bill forces people to take investment advice before entering into private transactions. Alternatively, the employer could seek authorisation to allow him to provide the facilities without providing for external advice. In either case, the attractions of the scheme would be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in clause 44 on misleading statements and concealment of material facts would catch any deliberate insider dealing in a private transaction where one side had price-sensitive information and the other side did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the amendment would not benefit anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the Minister's response to the amendment; I am also surprised at his reference to the equivocal position of my party. The Labour party has made its position clear on these matters in various Finance Bill Committees in recent years. The hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) has attended those Committees, so he will know that we support these schemes vigorously in every way. Perhaps the Minister will withdraw his remarks and put the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his refusal to accept our amendment, the Minister is setting up a two-tier system of investor protection. Those who use the more formalised arrangements for exchanges, and the general facilities that we are discussing, are to be protected, but those who enter into share exchanges at the place of work—very often such schemes are based at the place of work—should not enjoy that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not accusing the Minister of being one of the Conservative party's two-nation wallahs, but his refusal to accept the amendment shows that that is his general approach. His only reason for such an exclusion is that people might incur expenditure if they were required to seek the advice of independent outside organisations. However, he surely accepts the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that within the place of work are people with insider information. It is possible that investors can be duped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is laughing. Would he care to intervene and tell me why he does not believe that people can be duped when carrying out those transactions? If he accepts that there is any element of risk, a duty is placed on him to ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
somewhere in the Bill—clause 44 is not sufficient— adequate protection is laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I have deliberately waited until the end of the morning so that we need not curtail our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will not accept that point of order. Is the hon. Gentleman trying to return to his original point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a different point of order, Sir Michael. Let me make it clear that I am in no sense challenging your ruling about the exclusion of amendment No. 48. I accept that that amendment has now gone, and that there is no chance of any further debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask you to reconsider something that you said earlier, Sir Michael, which opens up considerable problems for the future? As I recall, you ruled that a liability could not be an investment. You said that you had taken that view as a result of advice you had received. Indeed, a note you sent me said clearly that "liability" did not come within the term "interest". May I ask you to take advice on that ruling before our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was argued on points or order in our first sitting that a liability did not indicate an interest in terms of an hon. Member's interest the procedures of the House or the Minister's responsibilities, which is perfectly true. However, it is quite different to say that a liability does not indicate an interest or a right within the context of the Bill. Surely it is a liability that gives that right and which, for example, in the case of a contract entered into to purchase investments before money has changed hands, provides an interest in and a right to those investments purchased. That is what the purchaser obtains, and in return he has a liability to pay for them in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Your statement, Sir Michael, that a liability could not be included within the term "interest" or "right" could lead to someone contracting to purchase investments over which the terms of the Act do not operate until money has changed hands. That is why your statement, which I believe is on the record, would open up serious problems. Perhaps you would take further advice and comment on the matter in detail at our next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my words were exactly as the hon. Gentleman says, although I may be wrong. I shall certainly reconsider the matter, and perhaps return to it on our next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was very disappointing. He seemed not to give any weight to the factors making it more than usually desirable for the investors mentioned in paragraph 19 to have protection. His only real counter-argument seemed to be that to provide protection of the kind suggested in my amendment would be to increase the cost of the operation to those participating in that market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of effective protection will cost money; indeed, the whole scope and operation of the Bill will cost money. Self-regulation costs money.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
We all know that effective protection and regulation cost money. Therefore, that is a weak ground on which to argue that in this case the cost argument outweighs the needs for effective protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also sought to point out that the Bill is not intended to regulate transactions between ordinary private individuals, which is true. However, the thrust of the paragraph is that an employee share shop is not an ordinary transaction conducted between parties in private capacities at arm's length. It is a special facility set up to encourage share transactions; a veritable market place is being encouraged. Some form of protection is needed in that market place, for the reasons I gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A share shop could exist in a company with 10,000 or 20,000 employees. It might be as large as a broking business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. As the Bill stands, the Government, the designated agency and every other regulatory authority would simply opt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
out of what could be a substantial volume of business conducted in conditions where the possibilities for misleading or presenting deals not fully to their advantage to unsophisticated investors are rife, which is worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall obviously be debating this matter on our next sitting, and the Minister may wish to investigate what is going on in relation to share shops. He might come back with evidence that the operation is not as large as we maintain it is. Perhaps he will tell us at our next sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful to my hon. Friend. If I had time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
