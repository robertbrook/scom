<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 6, line 19, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>" and only if the proposed adjustment of remuneration does not involve reopening closed negotiations.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 50, in page 6, line 19, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>" provided that such different information was not and could not have been available and known to the determining authority at the time of the earlier determination ".</p></blockquote>
No. 42, in page 6, line 25, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"'different information" means only such supplementary information relating directly to the information on which the earlier determination was made and which was available to the determining authority at the date of the earlier determination but to which the determining authority did not have regard.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee long and I hope that the Minister will assist me by accepting our amendments. They are intended to ensure, first, that, where there have been negotiations about a settlement with the professions, the negotiations will not be reopened as from the start in the light of new information, because we think that that is wrong and, secondly, that only changed circumstances which are germane to the contract will be considered.<br><br>
As we read the clause, it would permit Ministers to adjust remuneration in a way that amounted to the total reopening of negotiations which everybody thought were closed and satisfactory. We accept, as I think the professions do, that it is not improper, in intention anyway, to have an adjustment at the end of the period of a negotiated arrangement, but it would be improper for the Government to wish to reopen the negotiations on the basis of changed circumstances that were not wholly relevant. As far as we can see, a shift in the price of the dollar, of seed corn in Guatemala or shrimps in Bangladesh could be used by the Government as a reason for reopening the negotiations on glasses, which we do not think is a sound way of going about things.<br><br>
We also do not believe, as should be clear from amendment No. 50, that, where the Government might reasonably have predicted before the nego-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
tiations finished that something would happen, they should suddenly remember those factors and benefit from them. If something was known to the Government when the previous negotiations closed or was reasonably predictable, the Government should not be able to drag that in at a later stage, saying "Oh dear, somebody has just found a file. We want to knock a few quid off, so we have thought of this, that and the other."<br><br>
In short, we believe that it is right and proper, if there are changes in factors which are directly relevant to the negotiations and which could not reasonably have been foreseen, for the Government to seek to make an adjustment at the end of the period, but not in any other circumstances. We do not want the Government to come back for a second bite at a cherry which they knew about in the first place; we do not want them pleading totally irrelevant bits of information; and we do not want them reopening the negotiations.<br><br>
Subject to my usual caveat about the inadequacy of our drafting amendments—we do not necessarily expect the Government to accept these amendments as worded; they may be faulty and may not achieve what we are seeking to achieve—we hope that the Government will accept the principle behind them and be prepared to limit the very wide scope which the Bill would give them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly in support of the final comments of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), if not on the detailed wording of the amendment as we await to hear from the Minister whether its drafting is defective. I certainly support the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman has just argued.<br><br>
There is general concern that clause 3 gives far-ranging, in fact sweeping, powers to the Secretary of State for Social Services. Therefore there is a general desire to see those powers more accurately defined. If the amendment goes some way towards achieving that end and clarifying those powers, it is; welcome.<br><br>
It would be a clear breach of faith by any future Secretary of State if he or she used the clause continually to renegotiate past payments. It is also worth stressing that it would be particularly unacceptable to the professions involved, to the Health Service and therefore to public opinion generally if the failure to obtain correct information at the outset led to the Secretary of State deciding that some form of subsequent renegotiation was necessary. It would obviously put various medical services in a continual state of unnecessary uncertainty about their financial affairs. That strikes me as being an unhappy state of affairs which no Government or supporter of the National Health Service would wish to see.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will guarantee on the specifics of the amendment and perhaps later on the generality of the clause, that the Government will not alter significantly or undermine the broadly agreed and maintained procedures for correcting past underpayments and overpayments—except, of course, on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
those rare occasions when, the Government have tried to claw back in dramatic fashion, have been taken to court by the profession concerned and found to be in complete contravention of the law.<br><br>
I also support amendment No. 50, again on the ground that we want greater definition to be established over the renegotiation of payments. Arguing, as the amendment does, that such provisions are acceptable only if the information on which they are based was not available when the original decision was made, seems to me eminently sensible.<br><br>
So, while we accept that circumstances can change and that there has to be an element of flexibility and good faith between those carrying out any set of negotiations, it is important to highlight our concern about the clause and the sweeping powers which it will confer on the Secretary of State which, if not accurately and tightly defined, could be used to undermine the negotiation process and the basis on which the contracting services within the National Health Service receive their agreed remuneration. I hope that the Minister will set some of our fears at rest. Whatever he may think of the amendment, I hope that he will take the matter on board between now and the remaining stages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are important to the professions as a whole, not merely to the opticians, but to the dentists, the pharmacists and the National Health Service. The problem arose when the Department suddenly found that the opticians were making profits that it had not known about. It said, "Goodness, we cannot allow that to happen. We must try to recoup the money." That may have been the correct attitude.<br><br>
I should not want anyone to make profits that were larger than agreed or intended. But the Government went about it in an unsatisfactory and immoral way. First they said that they would try to recover the profits from another service: eyesight tests. But the profits were being made on the sale and manufacture of frames and glasses.<br><br>
Then they said, " We will do it in a blanket way so that we penalise everyone, whether they receive these unintended extra profits or not." I consider that immoral. I do not agree with Mr. Justice MacPherson, who ascribed no bad motive to the Secretary of State. I am afraid that I do. He was lacking in morals and he should have known better. Of course, it is for the courts to bring to the public notice what the Secretary of State has been trying to get away with.<br><br>
The opticians have never been party to setting rates with the Department of Health and Social Security for reimbursement of frames and lenses. That has always been done between the DHSS and the optical manufacturers. Mr. Justice MacPherson said:
<br><blockquote><p>" It would be unjust if the opticians had equally to meet the cost since the ' unintended profits' would not have been made equally by the whole profession."</p></blockquote>
That is almost a verbatim statement from his judgment. Elsewhere in that judgment he said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
<br><blockquote><p>" If there was a fault, then it was with the Minister himself."</p></blockquote>
His words were restrained but nevertheless the point was there.<br><br>
I am glad, therefore, that the Secretary of State —this is his redeeming feature—said on Second Reading that he will not try to recover these profits again. Perhaps we could have some extra clarification today. If we have time and there is no pressure for us to hurry away, we can consider these matters in detail, and some extra clarification from the Minister would not come amiss. Opticians throughout the country want to be reassured that the Secretary of State will not try to institute yet again a way of recovering money that he feels he has been cheated of.<br><br>
I am not very happy that the money has gone from the National Health Service to the opticians, but it is the fault of the National Health Service. The sampling systems were too small and too irregular and there is no other explanation. The Secretary of State should let bygones be bygones. I am glad to see the Minister nod. We will start again from here. I shall be interested to hear what he says.<br><br>
The Bill would allow any Secretary of State to do what he or she pleases. Clause 3(2) refers to "different information", but that information is not defined. Perhaps, when the original determination was made, the weather was bad, and everybody felt a bit low and did not look at the clause closely enough. It is now summer, we are brighter in spirit, and we have looked at the clause more closely.<br><br>
I am not being entirely serious, but the principle is there. The " different information" is not defined.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Opposition Members believe that legitimate fears exist that if " different information " is not defined more closely, the Secretary of State could try to recover money in an arbitrary way using the forec of this wide-ranging legislation. That is not the way to legislate. We should legislate for unforseen circumstances. However, those circumstances should be circumscribed in the legislation to make sure that opticians, dentists and pharmacists, can be reasonably certain how their business will fare. It is unfortunate that during the past six or seven years of this Government, those professions have had to live from year to year, not knowing what would happen to their businesses.<br><br>
That is one of the economic problems created by the Government. It is also one of the problems of the National Health Service. The NHS does not know from year to year what its grant will be. The optician does not know whether he may have to repay to the Department some unquantifiable sum for which he thought there had been a negotiated agreement. The Government might suddenly announce that different information was available and mat under clause 3 they would demand repayment. Not only that, but the " different information " provision coupled with the other powers being taken to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
enable recovery of moneys from one part of the service because of an unintended overpayment by the Department in another part of the service, would make matters worse.<br><br>
Pharmacists might make unintended profits from the supply of drugs and the Department may wish to reclaim those unintended profits from the supply of containers for those drugs. That does not worry me. However, the Department might say that opticians had made unintended profits from the supply of lenses and that it wished to reclaim the money from eyesight testing. There is not sufficient correlation in that case, because many people who have an annual eyesight test do not subsequently need glasses. In that case, I believe that the Minister would have used his powers wrongly. I hope that the Minister will consider that point and ensure that the legislation or regulations use a form of words that will reassure those professions.<br><br>
The Minister has said that I have gone too far in defence of the professions that supply services to the National Health Service. I do not believe that that is so, because professional people, such as opticians, pharmacists and dentists should not be dissatisfied with the legislation under which they must operate. Legislators should ensure that legislation has the general agreement of the people whom it affects. Clause 3 affects contractors to the National Health Service and the Minister knows that they are apprehensive about what may happen if the Bill is enacted in its present form.<br><br>
The dentists, too, are worried and the British Dental Association has written to me, as it will have written to every member of the Committee. Since 1981, through the dental rate study group, the association has had a reasonable system whereby negotiations have taken place for about a year and have then been concluded.<br><br>
Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government to ensure that once negotiations have been closed they cannot be re-opened unless there has been a clear—not just a matter of pennies—catastrophic mistake. In that case, recovery should be only from those who have benefited from the overpayments. The Government would not be acting properly or legislating for the benefit of the country if they could not ensure that result, and there is no reason why they cannot do so. Otherwise they would be legislating for their own benefit, to make it easier for them to use a sledgehammer to crack the nut, the sledgehammer being the unamended Bill.<br><br>
The Government have the opportunity to legislate in a way that is acceptable to Opposition Members, the professions and the public, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pan-eras (Mr. Dobson) that if that is what the Government want, they should examine the question of " different information". Our amendments may not be appropriate, as my hon. Friend said. If so, we are prepared to listen to the Minister and hope that he will table an amendment or propose a different form of words on Report.<br><br>
Another possibility would be to make regulations, after consultation with opticians, pharmacists and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
dentists, who would be happy to discuss the matter with the Minister. Alternatively the Minister could reach an agreement with the contracting professions about the way in which the system would operate. However, if it is to work on the level of an agreement, I hope that the Government will not enforce such an agreement by drawing on the powers in the Act. That would be unfair. If the Minister wants to reach agreements with the contracting bodies, such as the British Dental Association—he may not do that, and I should prefer him to say that there is a problem which could best be solved by regulations or an amendment on Report—I hope that he will listen to them.<br><br>
I am not happy with the way in which negotiations are carried on. In the case of dentists for example, the Department of Health and Social Security provides expenses for technical work. It is suggested that the Department accepts work of a lower standard each year because that enables it to reduce the expenses. It might be better to change the way in which the agreements operate by making payments for technical work, such as false teeth, spectacles or frames, directly to the manufacturers rather than via the dentist or the optician. I am worried about a reduction in the quality of the work.<br><br>
With that caveat, I believe that the agreements with the British Dental Association work well and have done so- since 1981.<br><br>
To summarise, this is an important set of amendments. The clause contains draconian powers which will allow a Secretary of State to say at any time, on the basis of information which appears to be different, " We shall reopen the negotiations and you will have to lump it." That is not the right way to legislate. We want certainly, so that opticians, dentists and pharmacists know their business commitments and what their business prospects will be in succeeding years.<br><br>
The issue should not necessarily divide the Committee. I hope that the Minister will reply with clarity and in some detail and that he will take our points on board and say whether he thinks that anything can be done about them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Ray Whitney) </span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we penetrate below the atmospherics to which the Committee has been treated in the last 10 minutes or more, I think that we can find broad agreement on our objectives and principles—that is to say, fairness between the various agencies involved, not least the Government. I am delighted in some ways to see the new-found devotion of the hon. Members for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) and for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) to private enterprise and small entrepreneurs, who are the sort of people who will benefit from these arrangements with the professions, and that devotion is to be welcomed.<br><br>
But there is another side to the equation—the benefit to the National Health Service. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras speaks in somewhat scathing terms of the Government benefiting, but I hope that he will not forget that we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
talking about the National Health Service benefiting. Therefore we are seeking in these arrangements to maintain the balance which has existed hitherto and to establish that those arrangements continue. We are not seeking a power which would allow us to change past settlements arbitrarily and generally do what we like without the appropriate consultations or negotiations with the professions.<br><br>
The other point which Opposition Members have either failed or not wished to grasp is the time-frame in which the arrangements must be worked out. By their nature they extend over a period of years, and they must look forward and backward. Generally they have worked well and to the satisfaction of the professions. It is certainly our intention that they should continue to do so</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it usually a characteristic of a satisfied profession that it takes the Secretary of State to court?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not suggest that he is in favour of having no balancing arrangements. It is the characteristic of any individual, if there is an arrangement which benefits him, to seek the maximum benefit. But I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm that he is in favour of any profession—the opticians or any other—accepting the totality and that, if appropriate, there should be transfers between one item and another so that the National Health Service benefits. If the hon. Gentleman is not in favour of that balancing arrangement, it will be helpful to the Committee if he will say so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the Minister listened to what I said, he would have heard me say that we were in favour of the balancing arrangement, subject to the conditions set out in our three clear amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have now established that, notwithstanding inaccurate references to the court procedure, we have the Labour party's support for the balancing arrangements. Perhaps I may delay the Committee for a moment on that court case. The opticians did object to the Government's attempt to recover from the separate sight-testing and dispensing fees the £11 million overpaid for appliances. Certainly that arrangement had not been made before. The Bill will permit the use of one type of payment as a means of adjustment for another type. As I understand it, we now have the agreement of Opposition Members to that arrangement. But let me repeat that the Government have given an undertaking not to use this power to reopen the adjustment which the opticians successfully challenged in court.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
It is also important for the Committee to note that in future differences of view will be less likely. From July 1986 there will only be one type of payment for opticians—the sight-testing fee—as the voucher system will replace the supply of NHS spectacles.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
Given the general principle that we are seeking to sustain arrangements which, on the whole, have worked well and are not seeking additional powers, I hope that the Committee will accept that, while we understand the spirit of amendment No. 38 and have considerable sympathy with it, it would cause many problems. For example, when would a negotiation be deemed to be closed? As I have said, all negotiations are based on forecasts or estimates of what will happen over the period covered by the determination. How many sight tests will take place, how many prescriptions will be dispensed and how much will the ingredients of those prescriptions cost the pharmacists? There is a problem about striking a limit.<br><br>
Amendment No. 42 would not allow the determining authority to use any new information relating to a previous determination to consider whether that determination was satisfactory. I have explained that fixing determinations is a continuing process which must look back at the same time as it looks forward. For example, part of the pharmacists' remuneration is a professional fee for every prescription dispensed. If, after making a determination based on forecasts for the number of prescriptions, the forecasts were found to be wrong and the pharmacists' fees should have been lower, amendment No. 42 would not allow us to use that new information. Therefore, we could not adjust a future determination to put right that past error and give the taxpayer proper recompense. But this would not be fair to the taxpayer or the National Health Service, and therefore I advise the Committee to reject the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 50 would allow the determining authority to use only new information when considering whether an earlier determination was unsatisfactory. Again, we have sympathy with the amendment, as it seems reasonable. But if it were accepted, it would be easy to envisage the long arguments that would take place. For example, was the information available at the time of the earlier determination? Did the determining authority know about it? Is this old information dressed up in new clothes? Some of the data used in considering levels of remuneration are very complex, and it could prove difficult to resolve what was and what was not new. Situations might also arise in which the determining authority and the profession in question might have to fall back on old, long available information because expected new information was not forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been saying how these wonderfully happy negotiations based on mutual trust and respect and all the rest of it will take place and that amendment No. 50 would open up the possibility of wrangles about definitions and about what was new information and what was not known. If negotiations were getting bogged down in detail of that kind, such would be the rancour that it would hardly reflect the happy equilibrium and sense of balance which the Minister has been enthusing over this morning. Is he not destroying the force of his own argument?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed I am not. Of course we are interested in happy arrangements, as, I am glad to say, are the professions. As the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) pointed out, the British Dental Association, for example, made clear its satisfaction with the clause, subject only to a certain assurance, which I am glad to give.<br><br>
The restrictive provisions of amendment No. 50 would be dangerous, but I give the assurance that we are firmly committed to full and fair negotiation and the provisions in the National Health Service Act 1977 also support and buttress that commitment. I am confident that the professions concerned accept the spirit of what I am outlining and that any of these amendments would be damaging.<br><br>
If any Government, certainly not this one but any future Government—the mind shies away from the prospect—were foolish enough to put forward spurious old or new information as a means of unreasonably reconsidering past examinations, they would receive short shrift from the contractor professions' representatives in renegotiation. That would certainly not be in the interests of the National Health Service. It is not something which we would seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister is saying and believe him when he says that a future Government would never seek to do something which was not acceptable to the professions. But the Minister must bear in mind that the Secretary of State tried to do something to the opticians, was taken to court, and lost. So it is not inconceivable that a future Government would do things which would be opposed by the professions and the public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to burden the Committee again, but I hope that it will be accepted by all Opposition Members that that court case was on the basis of a basically fair approach . The determination of the judge as the law stood was that the two elements should be kept separate. But I hope that the hon. Member will agree that the basic approach that we understood to exist and which will now be enshrined in the Bill—the right and duty to balance and adjust payments between one pocket and another—must make sense.<br><br>
Therefore I hope that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye will not persist in saying that there was any suggestion of perfidy or greed or any other unhappy quality on the part of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It was and continues to be our intention, to preserve a fair and reasonable balance in the interests, in particular, of the National Health Service in a smoothly operating system.<br><br>
I repeat that I applaud the conversion of Opposition Members to defending private enterprise, but the Government have to strike a balance between the two conflicting interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I am moved to intervene again by the Minister's almost holier than thou attitude. He can surely appreciate that an objective view of what the Government are doing and what the Minister is promising would also involve saying " But we have to set these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
wide-ranging powers in the knowledge that the very people who will be the first to benefit from and enjoy them are the same people who were found guilty in court a few months ago because they were behaving in a disgraceful fashion." If the Minister were looking at that situation, would he not say, " Given that those are the kind of characters who will be operating this, perhaps we do need more safeguards rather than just bland platitudes or reassurance."?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that those benefiting and enjoying the arrangements are the Government, he is wrong. Those who are benefiting are those who benefit from the National Health Service. I am dismayed that even the Social Democratic spokesman seems not to have the interest of the National Health Service at heart. I applaud his conversion to private contractors, a welcome conversion but he should understand that Governments have a duty to strike a balance. That is what hitherto has been struck and is enshrined in the clause. Inevitably, given its complex nature and the number of factors involved, it cannot be put down in black and white and cut and dried. The professions accept that.<br><br>
In future, the very large swings and roundabouts will be changed. I hope that, having now understood a little better the sincere intentions of the Government and the satisfaction of the contracting professions, the Opposition will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am scracely more convinced by the Minister's contribution. In fact, I am less convinced than I was before I move the amendment. In relation to the court cases, he seemed to be asking us to take several other offences into account. That is not usually the way people try to convince the rest of us that they are a good lot.<br><br>
We need to get one thing clear. The Prime Minister and other members of the Government frequently talk about something called the rule of law. They appear to misundstand the rule of law. The concept of the rule of law is not, " We have made the law: you will obey it." It is that that is the law and the Goverment have no powers over individual citizens or groups beyond the law. It is a concept intended to protect people and groups of people against governments and the exercise of arbitrary power by governments.<br><br>
We are saying, because we have always believed in the rule of law, that the Government should set down in the statute restraints on their powers in relation to the remuneration arrangement with the professions. They should not give themselves wide powers to change their mind, to consider things that are totally irrelevant, or to say, "Oh dear, we have got it wrong. We should like to put it right now."<br><br>
The Opposition have always accepted that it is right to have the concept of an adjustment at the end if something has cropped up—for example, a new fiddle invented by a few of the contractors. If contractors invent a fiddle during a negotiated arrangement, it is right and proper to seek to recover from the fiddlers, but no one else, their illicit gains.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
What we object to is the Government being wise after the event or attempting to recover money from all those in the profession, not all of whom have been making odd bits of unforeseeable profits and benefiting from' these oddities. The Government's position is not very sound.<br><br>
The Minister also said that he was confident that the professions agreed with him. My impression is that, unless they started writing letters with the word "not" missed out, they do not agree with him. They are writing to us saying that they agree with our amendments, which is not usually a sign of confidence in what the Minister is saying in rejecting the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He should talk to his hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). Then they could perhaps march parallel. The hon. Member for Wrexham quoted with the approbation the British Dental Association's letter and enclosure of 2 May, which said that it was broadly content with clause 3, but that there was one point on which it sought final reassurance: that there was no intention to change the current system. That assurance we have given time and again. I invite the hon. Gentleman to take advice from his hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also received the letter. We seem to be subject to such wide circulations these days. Perhaps the BDA is satisfied. But some others are not, as the Minister knows. In any case, we have always asserted that it is not just a matter of the relationship between a few ministerial or departmental negotiators and the professions. There are matters for which we have responsibilties. If the Opposition are not satisfied with some arrangements that the Government have come to with the professions, we are entitled to say so, whether the professions like it or not. That is one of the reasons why we are here. That is why we are not just representatives of the professions.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The Government should accept restraints and limitations on the wide powers that they are giving themselves. We do not want to put the matter to a vote today and we hope that after further representations before the Report stage or before the Bill goes to the Lords, the Government will see the sense of accepting limitations on the far too broad powers which they are taking to do what has been found by judges to be unlawful.<br><br>
When Governments take powers that the courts have previously found unlawful, they have a duty to ensure that those powers are exceedingly circumscribed. I should have expected that to be part of the general philosophy of this Government. If not, perhaps that is why they are so popular with the voters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come to an important group of amendments on a matter about which there has been a great deal of comment in the press and apprehension among the professional bodies and the contractors to the National Health Service.<br><br>
The amendments fall into two groups. The major group deals with any future clawbacks by the Government and seeks to ensure that money is recovered only from contractors who have benefited from any overpayment. I need not elaborate.<br><br>
The court case which the opticians brought against the Government showed it to be immoral for the Government to try to claw back money from opticians who might have entered the service only a year previously and would not have received the unintended overpayments. Yet they would have been held by the Government to have received them and would have been forced to receive underpayments to compensate. That should not be allowed. No civilised country should legislate in that way. I am not talking about the pennies here and there. Clearly, a certain amount of pooling is necessary, but it would have been very serious for any optician who had just entered the service to have this claw-back visited on him by the Government. It could happen again because the Government seem intent on taking these draconian powers to give themselves a free hand for the future. The amendments seek to ensure that, if there are any clawbacks, they should be from only those who have been deemed to have benefited. Amendment No. 47 seeks to delete the reference to other categories of work. It would ensure that if there were an overpayment in one service—for example, eyesight testing—any future clawback should only be from eyesight testing.<br><br>
The Government should get their act together. They should get the system right, they should take enough samples of prices so that all these quite large changes are unnecessary. There should be much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
More fine tuning and the administration should be brought up to date so that it is possible to identify those who have benefited and get the money back from them. The Government ought to be able to do that and not pretend that their administration is so poor and hamfisted that they cannot do that.<br><br>
If the Government wish to claw back money, they should not claw money back from one area if they recognise that the unintended profits have been made elsewhere.<br><br>
I hope for a helpful reply from the Minister. Last time he was not helpful and insisted on taking as many powers as he could. No doubt the Minister will insist on taking as many powers as he can in relation to these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Try as I might to be helpful, and I believe that we share the same objective, I am not able to accept the amendments of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). They impinge on the delicate balancing mechanisms which have worked well for many years and which differ between the different professions.<br><br>
The general medical practitioners and the independent Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body have their own arrangements. For the dentists, the dental rates study group deals with these matters. The opticians and pharmacists have different arrangements. At present, inquiries to establish contractors' costs take place about every four years. Some different issues are involved there, in particular the length of time involved which result sometimes take, and have resulted in two cases in particular, in very large amounts being involved. For example, there was a payment of some £92 million to opticians to make good past underpayments for the period 1978 to 1982. There was a £54 million overpayment to pharmacists for the period 1980 to 1984 in respect of drug cost reimbursement. In both cases where the amounts were so large account was taken of the period for which contractors had provided an NHS service.<br><br>
The pharmacists' new contract provides for more frequent cost inquiries. This will help limit the potential levels of underpayment or overpayment. For the same purpose, we are negotiating with opticians' representatives to introduce more frequent inquiries.<br><br>
Amendment No. 41 would remove the flexibility which allows us to take account of the differences that I have outlined. The hon. Member is concerned about new entrants to the profession, but clause 3(3) confirms that the proposal is to take account of, and that the Government are fully aware of, the position of new contractors. It is a delicate balance which should not be upset and I think that that is generally accepted by most of those concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept amendment No. 40? It seems eminently fair that in any determination the determining body must pay regard to how long people have been in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I invited the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) to move amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
No. 40 if he wished and he rejected my invitation and said that he was prepared to move amendment No. 41. We cannot now go back to amendment No. 40. I regret if I was in error in subsequently inviting the hon. Gentleman not to move amendment No. 40, but I understood that he was more concerned about moving amendment No. 41.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Philip. I did not grasp what you were saying. My understanding was that I would be moving amendment No. 41 but that we could discuss the other amendments at the same time. If I am in error, I apologise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. 41 was among the subsequent amendments that we would be discussing. I did read them out. On the other hand, there is probably no harm in the Minister referring to amendment No. 40 in passing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to take note of that point. I shall look at it again and write to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will accept that we are booth seeking the spirit of subsection (3), but I shall consider further the impact of amendment No. 40.<br><br>
The other amendments would prevent the Government from taking into account any overpayment which has occurred or will occur before the Bill is enacted, when future determinations are considered and would fail to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer and the National Health Service.<br><br>
It is important that I make the position clear. We are not changing past settlements. The fact that future fees reflect past under or overpayments is part of the remuneration system. Our underlying aim is to be reasonable and even-handed in our dealings on the professions' remuneration. The parties involved in negotiations might have produced a mistaken result compared with what they had intended, because of, for example, an incorrect forecast of costs. If either the taxpayer owes the profession money or the profession owes the taxpayer money, that should be put right. We are making it clear that we have the right to recover any overpayment or repay any underpayment to the professions.<br><br>
To give an example, following the 1978 inquiry the Government paid opticians some £92 million to make good past underpayments. We also agreed not to use the new provisions to take into account the opticians' £11 million of unintended profits, which has been the subject of so much debate this morning. On the other hand, a 1983 inquiry showed that a £15 million overpayment had occurred on sight-test fees. Despite the running that Opposition Members seem to want to make about the court case, I hope that they will accept that, just as we have honoured our commitment and paid out the £92 million, it is now for the opticians to follow suit and that it must work both ways.<br><br>
Apart from the Bill, the Government have powers under section 43 of the 1977 Act to rectify underpayments occurring before the Bill is enacted. Therefore, the professions would continue to receive the benefit of past underpayments. But the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
would deprive taxpayers of recompense for past overpayments up to and including determinations for 1986–87. I hope that the Committee will accept that that would be inequitable and wrong in the interests of the National Health Service.<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 47 would completely neutralise the intended effect of subsection (7). As I explained earlier, it is important to have the provisions in subsection (7). I hope that the hon. Member for Wrexham will accept that the amendment would take us back over ground that we have already covered on amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 52.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not completely happy with what the Minister has said. We believe that Ministers are taking too much power. The provision could be circumscribed or the limits of the Government's power laid down in regulations. At present they are unbounded. I am not happy with it, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to halt the progress of the clause, but I want to make one or two comments on clause stand part.<br><br>
First, I support the clause in principle, because what it does is fair. If there is an overpayment in one year, the money should be taken back. In this context the Government act on behalf of the taxpayer, which is fair and just in principle. What is at issue is the way in which that is done and whether it is done fairly according the rules of natural justice.<br><br>
The Opposition have been arguing about whether other things are equal and whether it is being done in a just way. I underline the Opposition's arguments. We have been trying to ensure that things are done in a scrupulously fair manner on behalf of the professions involved, because that is just and right. We are now debating the principle of the clause, and Opposition Members do not dissent from the principle that a balance of one year with another is fair.<br><br>
I have one or two questions to put to the Minister. As Committees are learning as well as arguing occasions, we have an opportunity to obtain informtion and find out how things work. Can the Minister say how the money has moved over a period of years? One year we may take money from the professions and another year they may take money back from the Government. It is a two-way process, and we are talking about the balance.<br><br>
I am well advised, because I have received answers to parliamentary questions that I put as long ago as last November, when I wanted to know how this money moved to and fro in the case of the dental profession and who was taking what from whom. I understand that deductions were made in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
financial years 1981–82, 1982–83 and 1983–84. Therefore the movement of money was the Government making an adjustment for overpayment. Can the Minister say how the money has moved over a longer period? I have information only for the dental profession and I wonder what the balancing adjustments are for the other professions over a convenient period of years.<br><br>
It strikes me that adjustments arise partly from the volume of work done. If the Government fix a price with dental practitioners for fillings on an estimate of the volume of work and then more work is done at that price rather than less, the Government will pay money over. But if there is a period when the volume of work is less and the movement of money is the other way, the arguments take on a different slant. The arguments that are put at any time relate to how the money is moving.<br><br>
This is a complex state of affairs. We are talking not only about a clawback mechanism but about the whole framework of payments to the professions, how complicated they are and how satisfactory they are as regards the amount of flexibility and certainty they give professions to make their investments, adjust their expenses and so on. It is a complicated picture.<br><br>
Let me take that point a little further. The current pay year for dentists—I have taken a closer interest in that profession than in any other although the same applies elsewhere—began in April. The doctors' and dentists' review body report is awaited and after that report is received calculations are made about payments. Once they are announced, the British Dental Association and the DHSS start talks on what should be paid from April. That is a complicating factor to begin with.<br><br>
While all that is going on, there is a period of uncertainty while dental practices, which are essentially small businesses, make calculations about what they can do. In addition to all that, account has to be taken of the balancing arrangements that are the subject of the clause. So we have grafted another complicating factor on to the whole process of the pay framework.<br><br>
I am advised that agreement is normally reached in late July and that the announcement comes in August and then a new fee scale incorporating the changes comes in October, six months or more after the initial process began. This is an elongated and complicated process which gives rise to uncertainty.<br><br>
Is the Minister aware of the complexities? I have no doubt that he is aware, because he has to puzzle over what has to be done. Is there any way in which these complications can be short-circuited and the framework simplified so that we give more certainty to the professions? After all, they have to buy equipment, make adjustments and do all kinds of other things. A dentist said to me only last week, "With this sort of complicated framework, how can one make plans? How can one approach the bank manager when the pay adjustment is not announced until about one third of the year has passed and when full implementation does not take

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
place for six more months? "Has the Minister thought about ways to alleviate this so that the professions are given more certainty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whitney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). I welcome his general support for the clause and reemphasise that the objective is to put beyond doubt the statutory basis of what has been a long-standing and accepted practice for adjusting future payments to offset past underpayments or overpayments in the contractor professions.<br><br>
Since the NHS was set up, the principle underlying the payments to the professions has been that they should receive their average costs plus an element for profit or professional remuneration. Their true costs can be established only retrospectively through periodic inquiries. In the interim period, payments are based on cost estimates. Under such an arrangement it is only fair, both to the professions and to the taxpayer, that there should be a mechanism for correcting past payments which are shown to have been inadequate or excessive.<br><br>
Payments to contractors include some £2·5 billion a year to reimburse the average costs of the service they provide. So' even small margins between estimated and actual costs can represent considerable sums due to one side or the other. That figure responds in some measure to the anxieties to which the hon. Member for Ipswich referred. It is important to put in perspective the size of what we are talking about—quite small adjustments in the global figure against a sum of £2·5 billion. I accept that in one particular practice there might be a significant impact, but in the context of the national figure—while wishing to continue to simplify as far as possible on the lines which the hon. Member suggested, and to speed it up if possible—we should not get this out of proportion.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked for some figures. I have examples of pharmacists and ophthalmic opticians. Doctors and dentists are treated separately, more quickly and in rather smaller figures relatively. So to the extent that there have been problems, they have occurred with the pharmacists and ophthalmic opticians.<br><br>
So far as pharmacists remuneration is concerned, in 1977 and 1978 the amounts due from the profession were £7·9 million and £12·9 million. In the succeeding four years, there were amounts due to the pharmacists' profession of £2·5 million in 1979, £12·3 million in 1980, £4·4 million in 1981 and £800,000 in 1982.<br><br>
In the case of dispensing fees for ophthalmic opticians, amounts were due from the profession of £300,000 in 1977 and £900,000 in 1978. In the following years, amounts due to the profession were £2·2 million in 1979, £4·2 million in 1980. £6·4 million in 1981 and £2·1 million in 1982. It is important to recognise that when set against the global figure, those are relatively small amounts.<br><br>
I emphasise yet again that this clause represents no change in policy. It simply seeks to put beyond reasonable doubt the statutory basis for the NHS contractor professions' remuneration arrangements,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
in the interests of the professions, the taxpayer and, of course, users of the National Health Service.<br><br>
To emphasise this, I remind hon. Members of two assurances that have been given during the passage of the Bill. First, there is the assurance that this Government would not use their powers to make an attempt to recover the £11 million over-reimbursement to opticians, which was the subject of recent court proceedings. Secondly, there is the assurance that there is no intention whatsoever to use the Bill to change the current system of determining the pay of medical and dental practitioners, which is based on the recommendations of their independent review body. Those assurances help to confirm the point that this clause does not represent any change in policy.<br><br>
Although the remuneration systems of the contractor professions are similar in principle, there are significant differences in their operation. This clause must cover those differences and in some cases this requires the flexibility and discretion to which I referred earlier.<br><br>
I think that the clause achieves its aim in a way that is fair to both the professions and to the taxpayer, and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 states that:
<br><blockquote><p>" There shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament any increase attributable to this Act in sums so provided under any other Act."</p></blockquote>
Yet the Explanatory and Financial Memoradum under the heading " Financial Effect,", says:
<br><blockquote><p>" <i>Clause 1</i> has no implications for public expenditure. Clause 2 … will produce some future public expenditure savings of about £5 million a year, after allowing administrative expenses. Clause 3 … authorises an increase in expenditure, though in fact no increase is expected to result."</p></blockquote>
Yet clause 4 allows the Government to have their piece of bread buttered on both sides. It shows the way in which the Government have approached the whole Bill. It is possible to say that one will not do something when one will do something. We know that it will increase expenditure under clause 1. If the Government admitted that and set aside a reasonable amout of expenditure under clause 1, we should all be happier.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is a formal clause which in similar words occurs in other Bills. It makes financial provision and is linked with the money resolution, not on the basis that money might be involved in improving kitchens, but in a more technical sense that clause 2 will allow the new pharmacists' contract to be introduced which will, in turn, provide some savings.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
However, within an overall saving some minor new expenses will be required to implement the new procedures for allocating NHS pharmacy contracts. That toing and froing requires the money resolution and this clause. Somewhat similar considerations apply to clause 3.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that no great power is being granted to the Government in this way. It is a formal provision which meets the rules of the House.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 53, in Title, line 2, after " food ", insert " and health and safety ".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the clause emanated from my right hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley), it is probably better drafted than it would be had it emanated from my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and myself. It seeks to extend health and safety legislation to hospitals by lifting Crown immunity from hospitals. This House and the whole country have a duty and responsibility to those who work in, are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
treated in and visit hospitals. As we said earlier, everyone recognises that hospitals are rather dangerous places. We must keep those dangers to a minimum. People entrust themselves or their relatives to a hospital in the hope that it will restore them to health or relieve pain, but that can be done only if hospitals are clean and wholesome places.<br><br>
We accept that there is a duty to provide the best medical treatment available as well as the best<br><br>
nursing standards and high levels of technical backup. We also want to see the best standards of performance by all hospital staff. The Government have accepted the logic of that and have now accepted that Crown immunity prevented the establishment of the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene in kitchens. If it is right to accept that for kitchens, why is it not right to do so for the wards, the corridors, or the notorious backyards of many hospitals? Merely by walking through them it is clear that some are a positive threat to health, yet we expect sick people to be transported through them and we expect those who are intended to make the sick well to go through them.<br><br>
We all know places where there are piles of rotting rubbish, which by its very rotting nature is a threat to the health of those in hospitals. In other places there is dry rubbish and a fire risk, or the rubbish may be in an inconvenient place where someone might fall over it. There may be a combination of all three. They are all wrong and we need to ensure that the health and safety legislation extends to all these categories.<br><br>
Until now I have been talking predominantly about the health and safety of the patients. We must always remember that someone who goes to a hospital or places a child or relative in a hospital is entrusting the health and welfare of himself, his relative or neighbour to that hospital. It behoves us all to make sure that the hospitals are in a position to discharge those duties. Under the present system, it is not possible for the health authorities to be prosecuted if there are shortcomings.<br><br>
That is wrong and it affects the whole way in which the system is run.<br><br>
We, and Ministers in particular, have a duty to ensure the health and safety of the staff. When they are talking about pay, Ministers happily say that the NHS is the largest employer in western Europe, and so it is. But that simply means that they have a great responsibility for the health and welfare of many people who, as Ministers freely acknowledge, do important jobs in difficult circumstances.<br><br>
Only yesterday evening I had the great pleasure of attending the Florence Nightingale memorial service in Westminster Abbey, and the rather more dubious honour of sitting next to the Secretary of State. It occurred to me during the sermon that had Crown immunity applied to hospitals during that rigorous lady's active life, and if she were around today, she would undoubtedly not be in favour of Crown immunity preventing the establishment and maintenance of the highest standards of cleanliness in NHS hospitals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
As well as attending such services, the Secretary of State should bear in mind all that we were praying for. We actually prayed for those in Government responsible for the allocation of resources in the National Health Service. We need to make sure that in the allocation of resources, duties and responsibilities we give the nurses who were honoured yesterday—and should be honoured every day—a safe place to work in. We should give all the other staff in hospitals—the doctors and the ancillary and technical staff—a safe place to work in, because as well as sickness there are accidents, some of them dangerous and unpleasant, in hospitals.<br><br>
Ministers will no doubt argue that the semi-voluntary Crown notice system works, and that it is unnecessary to apply the full rigours of the health and safety legislation to those responsible for health and safety. Who says that it works just as well? The Ministers and those who are paid to agree with the Ministers. I know of no one other than Ministers and those paid to agree with them who says that the Crown notice system works. Scarcely anyone else will agree with them. Those who represent the people in all professions in the Health Service all say that they want the Crown notice system to go and the full rigours of the health and safety legislation applied to hospitals.<br><br>
The Government are in a bit of a dilemma, because they must argue either that the Crown notice system does not work—if it does not work, we are not discharging our obligation to those who work in the Health Service and therefore we should lift Crown immunity—or that it does work, and if it works, it will not make any difference if we lift Crown immunity. Ministers will argue that it will not cost anything either, because everything is fine in the present system<br><br>
If we can find something that satisfies the concern of those involved and costs nothing, it is the sort of thing that a sensitive and sensible Government or a Government in trouble would jump at. Having watched television on Sunday, I would even go so far as to say that it might be the sort of thing that the right hon. Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen) would commend to his hon. Friends: it costs nothing and satisfies all those concerned. It ought to be what every Government from time immemorial have been looking for.<br><br>
I do not want to go over all the arguments, but I ask the Minister to ponder what we have said, even if he will not accept our views, and to accept that ultimately it is proper to lift Crown immunity entirely from the National Health Service. If I may stray for but a second outside the strictest terms of the amendment, I have recently discovered that other aspects of Crown immunity also apply to the National Health Service, and they should be removed as well. On 25 March, when I asked the Secretary of State to make sure that no health authority would resort to the courts to get nurses out of the residential homes in which they were living, he gave me an unqualified guarantee. Last week I discovered that not only had a health authority commenced proceedings for repossession of such premises in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
Aldershot and Farnham but that the Secretary of State had joined in the action as plaintiff and moreover, to add insult to injury, was pleading Crown immunity. Therefore, there was to be no protection for the nurse and no need to resort to the courts because they would have no right to intervene.<br><br>
Therefore, there are other aspects of Crown immunity about which we are not happy, but today's amendment is confiend to health and safety legislation. The Government must accept either that the present system is not workings—and therefore we must discharge our duty by strengthening the hand of those who want our hospitals to be clean and wholesome places to work and be treated in—or that the system is working and it would cost nothing to lift Crown immunity. Those are the only arguments drat can be made. The Minister cannot mount a rational case against the new clause so skilfully drafted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the new clause would remove Crown immunity from health authorities in respect of unspecified health and safety legislation. I take that broadly speaking to mean the Health and Safety Act, etc. 1974, with which I was involved during its passage through the House some years ago. When the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) attempted to equate Crown immunity, in so far as it affects food regulations and hygiene, with Crown immunity as it affects health and safety legislation, his arguments did not hold out. Indeed, when the Labour Government looked at these matters in the late 1970s, they did not treat them identically but decided—I do not dissent from the judgment that they made—to deal with the hygiene and food regulation aspects of the matter by means of the circular to which we have referred many times, the 1977 circular, and with the health and safety requirements by the introduction and endorsement of the Crown notice system.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's arguments either deny and seek to discredit what was done by Government that he supported in the past. A distinction was drawn at that time which I think remains. Having been involved with delegations and looked at the representations that come in from a wide range of organisations about Crown immunity as it affects food and, in a much more limited fashion, as it has affected health and safety legislation, I think that those distinctions are mirrored outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Times have changed, even for the Government. It is possible for me to say—indeed, I am happy to say it—that the judgment arrived at by the previous Labour Government in respect of both these areas was wrong. It is more wrong now than it was then, because the build-up of experience suggests that things are different. But for us to suggest that it is reasonable to have a consistent approach between the two aspects is perfectly justified. After all, the Minister has changed the game with the Bill. He has accepted that Crown immunity should be lifted from the kitchens. We are saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
that it is logical to lift it from the lot. The circular did not work as well as was hoped and the Crown notice system is not working as well as was hoped. We can learn from experience and lift Crown immunity across the board, and everyone will benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps good to have drawn from the hon. Gentleman the acknowledgement that he now believes that the actions taken by the Labour Government in the late 1970s were wrong. Indeed, in regard to Crown immunity for kitchens, we have been putting right what was then done. But I have never criticised what was done at that time, as the hon. Gentleman is doing. What we are doing this year as regards food is right and proper, in view of all that has happened since the 1970s.<br><br>
I accept that time has moved on, but it has not moved on in a way that would undermine the fact that it was appropriate in the 1970s to deal with these two matters slightly differently, always seeking the end result of higher standards. I endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about that. Equally, in that pursuit of higher standards, a different approach can be justified now.<br><br>
It might be helpful to the Committee if I briefly explain the present position. Health authorities are not currently subject to improvement or prohibition notices under the Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act, nor to prosecution for failing to meet the requirements of the Act, although their employees may be prosecuted if they fail in their duties. In 1978 a system of Crown notices was introduced which health and safety inspectors issue in circumstances where, in outside industry, they would issue an improvement or prohibition notice. The system provides for referral to the Secretary of State if the notices are not complied with.<br><br>
Although some 300 Crown notices were issued for NHS premises between 1978 and 1985, there has been no occasion on which the health and safety inspectors concerned felt that a reference to the Secretary of State was necessary. This therefore suggests that health authorities have been fulfilling their responsibilities and that view is supported by the Health and Safety Commission.<br><br>
Much has been achieved by co-operation and good will between the health and safety inspectors and Health Service administrators. I think that all members of the Committee would think it wholly appropriate that there should be a good working relationship and good co-operation between health and safety inspectors and Health Service administrators. For example, good co-operation leads to the setting of realistic time scales for improvements that take account of the need for the Health Service to continue to give treatment and care to the patients. That must always be a primary concern.<br><br>
The Crown notice system for health and safety matters is therefore working well. Indeed, paragraph 231 of the Stanley Royd inquiry report accepted:
<br><blockquote><p>"that such a notice is generally effective."</p></blockquote>
It went on to say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"It is compliance, rather than punishment, that should be the objective."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that view will be echoed in all parts of the Committee. We want compliance with proper standards. That is vital and the punishment side is clearly not the primary objective.<br><br>
The Health and Safety Commission has been keeping all these matters under review and put forward in March 1986 some proposals for improving the effectiveness of the Crown notice procedures. These improvements have been welcomed by Employment Ministers. They have been endorsed by the Management and Personnel Office and they became effective, I understand, from 4 April.<br><br>
The Health and Safety Executive's view is that, although some failures have been detected in Crown bodies, they have not generally been more extensive than those observed elsewhere, nor has it been possible directly to attribute them to immunity from prosecution. So the advice that one is receiving from the Health and Safety Executive is important and we should take note of it.<br><br>
I stress again the need for high standards. The fact that it is possible for these to be achieved under the existing Crown notice system, as it has now been improved, is much more widely accepted than the hon. Gentleman would lead us to believe. Of course I and my colleagues in other Government Departments will keep these matters under review.<br><br>
I hope that, having said that, the hon. Gentleman will not press his new clause. If he did, I would have to advise my colleagues to vote against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astounded to hear what the Minister said. It means that the Health and Safety Commission has either not being doing its job or did not have powers to do its job and has been deliberately turning a blind eye to what has been going on in the hospitals because it knew that it could get the Crown notice system to work. It has turned a blind eye to all the cockroaches and the danger to health that exists in our hospitals.<br><br>
We have bundles of cuttings inches deep about what is going wrong in hospital kitchens and in hospital backyards and in the wards. This is not the time to go through all that, but it is surely clear that, if the Health and Safety Commission had ennough powers, it would not have tolerated what goes on in our hospitals. Yet the Commission has tolerated it.<br><br>
This is not an argument for saying that the system is working well, because it has a purely statistical basis. If 300 notices are issued and none has been referred to the Minister, it shows that the system is not working well. On a statistical basis there ought to have been a small number. Some people are human and will not put things right under a Crown notice system. That will always be the case. There is no question of 100 per cent. compliance in any sphere of human activity. One would have expected one or two referrals, but the fact that none has been referred to the Minister only reinforces my belief that the Health and Safety Commision does not have the powers or the will to try to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
achieve proper standards of health and safety in hospitals.<br><br>
I support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) that if the system is working well the Government have nothing to fear from new clause 1. If the system is not working well, they should do something about it and still accept new clause 1. The Government were dragged into bringing forward this legislation. It was only when a private Member's Bill was on the verge of succeeding that the Government said, " We had better think about this and do something." The fact that they were dragged into it and are now doing something about hospital kitchens proves that not everything is well with health and safety in our hospitals.<br><br>
This is an argument that the Government cannot win. Eventually a Government will do something about it, will remove the Crown immunity and will provide independent inspection and control of what goes on in an important part of our public life. This Government could have done it, but they have missed the opportunity. In the end, the Government will lose the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not acknowledging our intention. We said on Second Reading that the object of the exercise was not to have health authorities prosecuted but to change the atmosphere so that everyone concerned attaches more importance to the cleanliness of hospital kitchens or health and safety considerations in the National Health Service. Anyone, on a fair reading of the Stanley Royd report, would accept that the concern was that, because the state had not decided that these circumstances merited the threat of court action, no one took the matter as seriously as they should.<br><br>
If Parliament is not prepared to say that those who transgress can be prosecuted, as they can in a factory or an office, clearly we do not attach enough importance to the matter, and the atmosphere is one of a cosy relationship between those responsible for monitoring health and safety and those responsible for ensuring that everything is done properly.<br><br>
Although we do not wish to press this matter to a vote, we shall continue to pursue it. The Government's position is wholly inconsistent. They have taken one aspect of health and safety in hospitals about which there has been concern: the food hygiene regulations. They have said that they are now convinced that it is right to let the full rigours of the law apply and to lift Crown immunity. We see no logical distinction between that sphere and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
the general sphere of health and safety and those aspects of hygiene which may lie outside both the food hygiene regulations and the health and safety at work provisions. There is still a grey area which might not be subject to the full rigours of the law even if the health and safety legislation were to be fully applied.<br><br>
Most people would expect that, as Parliament has decided that certain provisions for health and safety should apply in places which nearly everyone minks of as less important than hospitals—most general places of work—we should have a more rigorous system for health and safety in the National Health Service.<br><br>
All that we moderate people are pressing for is that the hospital side of things should be brought up to scratch. We are not saying that the rules should be made immediately more rigorous than those which apply elsewhere. We shall not give up, but shall raise the matter at later stages and at every opportunity. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do now report the Bill to the House.</p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Philip. May I, on behalf of the Committee, thank you and your colleagues for all the help that you have given us in the speedy consideration of the Bill. We began with a broad acceptance of the Bill by the Committee and everything that has happened during our proceedings has added to that consensus. We are grateful to you and your colleagues for facilitating the broad degree of consent in the Committee on the important provisions in the Bill although, as you well recognise, there are matters on which we are still not wholly in accord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Philip. I echo the Minister's sentiments and thank you for your chairing of the Committee. We were careful throughout the proceedings not to put down any amendments or new clauses which suggested the establisment of wholly unnecessary quangos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate that point. It had not escaped my notice. I thank both Members.</span></p>
