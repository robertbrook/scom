	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Oonagh McDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only one question on clause 67. It is about time sharing homes, which are excluded from the clause. Will the Minister consider whether it is justified to exclude them all? Some time sharing schemes, such as holiday homes, are in part investment in property and involve an investment element. Will the Minister examine whether all such schemes should be excluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry: (Mr. John Butcher) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can address my remarks to the hon. Lady's point. She rightly identifies the fact that time sharing is not primarily an investment product and, accordingly, it would be quite inappropriate to regulate these arrangements under the Bill. However, arrangements of the time sharing kind will be exempt only if their predominant purpose is personal use or enjoyment of the property. If time shares are sold as an investment, they will be caught under these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have just one brief point to raise. It is covered by Professor Gower in part II of his report, when he casts doubt on the wisdom of subsection (2), which excludes the application of subsection (1) to an advertisement issued
	<br><q><p>"to an authorised person; or</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(	<i>b</i>) to a person whose ordinary business involves the acquisition and disposal of property of the same kind as the property, or a substantial part of the property, to which the scheme relates."</p></q>
Will the Minister say whether he is entirely sure that such an exclusion is justified? There may be risks involved because, although the advertisement may be issued to "an authorised person" or to
	<br><q><p>"a person whose ordinary business involves"</p></q>
that type of property, such people might sell on suspect schemes to the innocent who were not involved in such business or who were not authorised persons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic system of regulation of collective investment schemes is found in this clause, which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
governs the promotion of schemes by authorised persons. In promoting these investments, authorised persons will, of course, also be subject to the general conduct of business rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is concerned with schemes, and not with persons. Schemes authorised or recognised under the Bill may be promoted to the general public but, as a general rule, other schemes may be marketed only to other authorised persons or to business investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Lady's question, that means that the Secretary of State or the designated agency will have powers to make regulations allowing authorised persons to promote selectively schemes which are neither authorised nor recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, the clause provides for a professional business that may wish to market to another professional business something that is not marketed to the general public. For example, a property company may wish to buy units in a property scheme. That is general practice, and we want to exclude such operations from the rules on marketing schemes to the general public. I hope that I have answered the hon. Lady's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 51, line 24, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"or it satisfies the conditions of any regulations made for the purpose under section 73 below".</p></q>
This is a technical and merely enabling amendment. Clause 70 could limit the action that the Secretary of State may wish to take in future with regard to novel forms of unit trusts. The specific kind of unitised trust that I have in mind in tabling the amendment is unitised property. At present, institutions and members of my profession are considering the creation of a unitised property market. A working party has been set up, including members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, Rowe and Pitman, Phillips and Drew and Mercantile House Holdings. Substantial institutional investors are interested in the market, including the Prudential and British Petroleum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of a unitised property system, similar to that in the United States, would greatly benefit investors. The smaller institutions and pension funds—which would like to invest in larger types of property, but lack the resources to do so individually— would benefit most. Unitised property would enable such institutions, and individuals, to take a share in large buildings, which they could not otherwise afford. That would lead to greater flexibility in the market and improve the investment portfolios of smaller pension funds. A market could be established, which would deal adequately with that type of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>493</span>
However, clause 70 requires each sale of a unit in that market to be carried out in relation to a new valuation of the building of which it forms part. Clearly, that would defeat the object of establishing a market in the units. To overcome that, we require an amendment giving the Secretary of State discretion to override that requirement, should he wish to do so. The amendment would not commit him to the approval of the establishment of a unitised property market, or any other similar market differing from existing unit trusts. But it would give him an important enabling power, and I hope that my hon. Friend will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I have just witnessed a practice that I have never seen before in my six years as an hon. Member. I have been told that the gentleman who has just entered the Committee Room is responsible to the Whips' Office. Perhaps we could be told what he is doing here and what are his rights of access to this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, I cannot give an explanation, but I shall have the matter looked into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we have the matter looked into during the Committee's proceedings today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) for raising a point that is gaining an ever higher profile as the weeks go by. I hope to assure him that the Government have seized the point and are considering it. We are trying to find a way to encompass the new market opportunities within the regime of British financial institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises the subject of unitisation of property, which the property world has been discussing a great deal since the publication last December of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' report, "The Unitisation of Real Property".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting concept of unitisation could lead to a new form of investment, which would be available to institutional and private investors alike. It could do much to open up new opportunities for property-based investment. However, it is still in its early days and much needs to be done to make the idea on the drawing board a reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my hon. Friend's wish to see that nothing in the Bill stands in the way of such an exciting new development. That is not to say that the principles of the Bill should be ignored. Any scheme would have to protect investors adequately. A crucial element, as the supporters of unitisation readily acknowlege, would be the formation of a new market on which units in individual properties would be traded, in the same way as shares in companies are traded on the stock exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the intention behind the amendment, which is to ensure that the criteria for authorising unit trust schemes, as laid down in clause 70, do not prevent the Secretary of State or the designated agency form authorising a single property unit trust. Authorisation would be necessary if a scheme were to be promoted to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>494</span>
However, my hon. Friend's amendment would commit me to operating within the framework of a system devised for the regulation of authorised collective investment schemes and, with the conventional form of unit trust in mind, we should be wiser to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conventional schemes provide investors with the opportunity to invest in a professionally managed portfolio of assets, which spreads risk and enables the investor to redeem his units at a price closely related to net asset value. The unitisation schemes that are being worked up envisage single unit trusts as an entirely different sort of creature, which would work differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Single property unit trusts should not be dealt with in a system of regulation designed for a different type of investment product. That would not ensure the proper protection of investors. Many of the safeguards for investors in single property schemes would not be provided by the schemes themselves, but by the availability of a secondary market on which investors could trade units. We must look closely at the implications of those major differences and, if necessary, adapt the Bill to take account of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that we must guard against any dilution of the unit holders' interest in the process of fixing prices? We must not allow managers a broader scope for fixing prices; such extra power could spring up from the new area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has a point. I hope that I can encourage him as much as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West by explaining that we are considering whether such operations fall within the framework that we have set up, which defines the forms of behaviour that will operate for unit trust operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to consider further whether single property schemes can appropriately be dealt with in chapter VII of the Bill, as schemes which may be promoted to the public. If they can, I shall bring forward amendments to deal with the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for that detailed and comprehensive reply. I appreciate his difficulties, and understand why he feels that the question of the establishment of a unitised property market needs more attention from his Department. However, I should like an assurance that the Bill will not necessarily preclude the establishment of novel markets and that whether or not the concept of unitised property finds favour with him, he will consider whether the Bill needs amending to enable the Secretary of State to deal with novel market proposals if they arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject receiving to such assurances, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of maintaining good relations with my hon. Friend, I must tell him that the reason why we cannot give assurances in precisely the terms he seeks is that this is a comparatively new concept. Whereas the Bill's structure does not preclude including such activity as an option available to the British market, we are not sure that clause 70 should be the vehicle to deliver the new market form that my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>495</span>
hon. Friend requires. I hope that I have reassured by hon. Friend that we are anxious to find an appropriate mechanism to permit these procedures to take place, with the safeguards that I have already described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that under clause 70 the Secretary of State is empowered to grant certificates to the effect that schemes comply with the requirements of any relevant European Community instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that European Community instruments on investor protection may, in future, be passed by majority vote within the Community. Will the Government be vigilant in ensuring that European Community instruments do not fall below the best standards of investor protection? We are dealing with markets that are rapidly becoming more international, and while we can legislate only on a national basis, it is extremely important that we are not trapped into a position which would offer standards below those that we would regard as acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in our legislation and policy-making we shall be setting the best standards internationally. Will my hon. Friend comment on that important principle that arises on clause 70?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was with precisely those issues in mind that the Government looked closely at the UCITS directive mooted for implementation in 1989. That directive lays down rigorous standards across European Community countries on levels of investor protection in unit trusts and open-ended investment schemes only. Our domestic industry is keen that the market should be opened up and that there should be equivalence of treatment in market opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be able to discuss on a later clause how that will take place within the Community, under the UCITS directive, and in countries outside the Community where there is equivalence of a regulatory regime for investor protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a third category, where there is no equivalence of regime, the Secretary of State or designated agency would wish to exert certain checks on the products on the British market. In anticipation of those clauses I can give my hon. Friend the clear reassurance that he seeks that we have been rigorous in ensuring that there is a reciprocity of regime within Europe and in the approval of individual schemes coming into the United Kingdom from Europe or from elesewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a particular question to raise on the provisions of the clause on which perhaps the Minsiter can help us, and my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) may have a more general point to make later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question arises under subsection (7) which provides that persons authorised under clause 23 will not be subject to the conduct of business rules made under clause 45, except as defined by paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). I understand that the impact of that is that persons authorised under clause 23 to manage collective investment schemes will not be subject to the conduct of business rules, except if they market unit trusts in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Securities and Investments Board has pointed out that there may be difficulty with rules prescribing a cooling-off period. If the sale of unit trusts is subject to a regime that generally prohibits cold-calling but allows cold calling provided that there is a cooling-off period, will the provisions of subsection (7) enable the rules in regard to a cooling-off period to apply to persons under clause 23? Does a cooling-off period relate to the marketing of an investment, or to the period after the investment has been marketed? Perhaps I have not explained myself as clearly as I should like, but I hope that the Minister can see the point I am driving at. Subsection (7) seems to allow rules to be applied on cold-calling but perhaps not during a cooling-off period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that we are talking about the EEC and not the generality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will have noted that the clause gives the Secretary of State the powers needed to implement the UCITS directive. Under that directive, UCITS authorised in another member state may market their units in the UK provided that they give notice to the UK authorities—the Secretary of State or designated agency. The clause establishes the necessary procedure for giving notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities must comply with UK marketing rules when marketing its units here and the Secretary of State or the designated agency may refuse admission if it appears that the UCITS will not be operating in accordance with our marketing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the operator of UCITS will need to be authorised to market units in the UK and how that would apply in practical terms. The answer to his question is no, provided that he limits his activities to the operation of the scheme and incidental activities. That is provided by clause 23. Clause 78(7) makes it clear that the conduct of business rules which apply to a UCITS operator are only those relating to marketing. That is because, under the directive, the home state authorities are responsible for the regulation and supervision of the UCITS, except for the operator's marketing activities in other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am choosing my words carefully when I say that we feel that marketing rules include cooling-off periods, but if they do not, we shall consider making that clear. I hope that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate now to raise a point that has been drawn to my attention by Professor Gower. The Committee will not need reminding that the professor's report has been highly praised and if he is dissatisfied, even worried, about matters dealt with principally by clauses 79 and 80, I believe that it would be wise to register that anxiety. In an extensive brief, he has drawn to my attention the fact that
	<br><q><p>"to market to the general public, UK schemes will apparently have to be orthodox unit trusts or open-ended investment companies— mutual funds—when the latter can lawfully be incorporated in the UK".</p></q>
He continues:
	<br><q><p>"Unorthodox foreign schemes, however, will be marketable in the UK under clause 79"</p></q>
and 80. He queries whether there is any reason for that discrimination against United Kingdom scheme managers, and goes on:
	<br><q><p>"the only effect of it will be to cause them to establish off-shore subsidiaries to enable them to take advantage of the other routes."</p></q>
After conceding that they may wish to do that for tax reasons, he points out that it
	<br><q><p>"cannot be to the advantage of the UK economy".</p></q>
There was no hint of that discrimination in the White Paper that preceded the Bill and there was a clear implication that
	<br><q><p>"the distinction would be between 'authorised' and 'restricted' schemes and that each would be available equally to British or foreign operators."</p></q>
Professor Gower makes a further point:
	<br><q><p>"the basic difference between recognition under clause 79 and clause 80 is that the former relies on designation of countries on the basis that their laws afford protection to investors in the UK equivalent to that under Chapter VII."</p></q>
However, he adds:
	<br><q><p>"Recognition under clause 80, on the other hand, applies to any foreign country and involves scrutiny of the scheme to see whether it can be recognised as affording adequate protection to the participants and complies with the other conditions of that section."</p></q>
In case the Minister is not aware of Professor Gower's principal point, there have been cases in recent years where companies that fall into the category under clause 80—and I appreciate that we are now talking about clause 79 stand part—have caused actual or potential harm to investors. They have been so obviously outside the control of the United Kingdom authorities that many believe that the Bill provides the opportunity to regularise that. There seems to be a lack of consumer protection where the full power of the Bill would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
applied to one type of scheme and a semi-blind eye would be turned to the possibility of inadequate consumer protection involved in the other. Professor Gower concludes that one way of removing the discrimination would be to delete clause 80 or for the Government to agree to amend it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower raises a sufficiently important point for me to ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for an assurance that he is satisfied that if the Bill were enacted precisely as drafted a purchaser of a scheme authorised under clause 80 would have the same level of consumer protection as the purchaser of a scheme authorised under clause 79. I am not sure that he would and neither is Professor Gower, who is a greater authority than 1.1 hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can reassure both of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a couple of points that should be raised on clause 79. First, paragraph 5.11 in part II of Professor Gower's report says that there should be "reciprocal recognition", which should be
	<br><q><p>"a condition for acceptance by us of foreign authorisations"</p></q>
to retain a good
	<br><q><p>"bargaining counter for securing fair treatment abroad of UK schemes."</p></q>
I hope that the Minister will consider that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said that great problems arose from clauses 79 and 80. Professor Gower has spelt them out in extensive correspondence with some members of the Committee. We want an assurance that the Minister will take on board Professor Gower's comments and the anxieties of SIB, especially those on the multiplicity of bodies authorising and recognising the schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern about offshore operations and about the kind of deals that they will offer to unsuspecting consumers. If the Minister will give us that assurance and tell us what alterations he proposes to make before Report, we shall consider them. If we are not satisfied with his proposals we shall table further detailed amendments to clauses 79 and 80 on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) and the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) for providing the Committee with an opportunity to discuss the issue of reciprocity, which has been of considerable interest to a number of people in the industry and to those who represent consumer groups. I shall make just one or two points, which I think SIB in particular will be grateful to hear clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause contains similar provisions to clause 78 and will enable the Secretary of State to establish arrangements with other countries whereby schemes authorised in those countries could be marketed to the public in the United Kingdom. Once a country was designated for this purpose, the operator of a scheme would first need to notify the Secretary of State or the designated agency that he wished the scheme to be recognised. The agency would still have a discretion whether to recognise the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would expect a country to be designated only if, first, it had a regime affording at least equivalent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
protection to United Kingdom investors. This is a specific requirement of the Bill. Equivalence would be judged against the standards set for United Kingdom schemes. Secondly, the scheme would have to be limited to investment in the same kind of assets within similar limits as United Kingdom authorised schemes. Thirdly, equivalent United Kingdom authorised schemes would have to be able to market freely in the country concerned. Fourthly, there would have to be a satisfactory arrangements for collaboration between regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering tabling amendments on Report which would state those conditions expressly. They would ensure that the United Kingdom investors had adequate protection and that, in the event of difficulties, they could rely on the regulator in the foreign country to ensure that their interests were safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would expect authorised persons, when marketing foreign schemes in the United Kingdom, to make it clear that the scheme was a foreign one, and thus not subject to the same degree of control by the United Kingdom authorities as a United Kingdom based scheme. Foreign schemes will be marketed in the United Kingdom only if they are recognised. They will take whatever legal form exists in the overseas country. The schemes will be looked at by the Secretary of State or the designated agency, whereas the people will have to be authorised under the relevant SROs. The two kinds of authorisation bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend has been encouraged by my use of the words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"We are considering introducing amendments on Report expressly stating that." But this part of chapter VII aims to reassure us that there is equivalence of investor protection on a state-to-state basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might this not be regarded as an opportunity—I do not say device—to avoid the publication of statements that would otherwise have been published about a person's conduct, when he may have been involved in a serious breach of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it may not be necessary to refer a matter to the tribunal, which I assume is why the word "need" is used. However, there have been cases of people resigning from bodies prematurely. I believe that there was a recent case in Lloyd's. Does the Minister expect that to occur under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how my hon. Friend's example can have any relevance to the provision, which would apply only when the Secretary of State or designated agency had decided not to proceed further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised the question of publicity. In normal circumstances the original intention of the Secretary of State or designated agency will not be made public. Notice of that intention will be sent to the person concerned, with copies going to specific persons identified in it. Although those concerned may choose to disclose the matter, the Secretary of State or agency can disclose their intention only if that is in accordance with the disclosure provisions in Clause 149. Even if there was publicity about the original intention, the person concerned would be free to publicise the fact that the Secretary of State or designated agency had changed their mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for his explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause concerns the circumstances in which references may be made to the tribunal. The legislation currently provides that such references should be made only when the Secretary of State has taken action. But we made an important change to the Bill by amending clause 12 and giving the designated agency the power to impose rule changes on SROs. We should therefore provide SROs with the scope to appeal against such a decision. Will the tribunal play a part in that process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt there is scope under the Bill as it stands for an SRO to appeal to the courts against a designated agency decision on a rule change. However, we ought to minimise cumbrous legalities as much as possible. Indeed one reason for changing clause 12 was because we thought that recourse to the courts would be unnecessarily slow-moving and elaborate. We wanted a more flexible and direct method to be employed. Similarly, an SRO with a complaint against the designated agency's decision could also go to the tribunal so that the appeal might be dealt with more directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. and learned Friend the Minister whether there is scope in the Bill for an SRO to appeal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
to the tribunal against a decision of the designated agency. If there is not, will the Government provide such scope, perhaps by amending clause 84?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Sir Michael, for not being in the room when my amendments to the clause were reached. I do not feel strongly about those amendments, but I shall rehearse the arguments for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendments would allow any self-regulating organisations, professional bodies, investment exchanges, or clearing houses that had not been recognised under the legislation to appeal against the refusal to recognise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Minister may argue that there is no need for such a provision, as such bodies could make representations and individuals could pursue other routes to authorisation, either through another SRO or through direct authorisation from the board. However, that could lead to a large number of individual applications. Therefore, it would be helpful to have such an appeals procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) will forgive me, if I deal first with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) raised. There is a natural transition from his point to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the tribunal is to provide a safeguard against the use by the Secretary of State or the designated agency of their executive powers against an authorised business or individual. Those powers can directly affect the ability of those involved to earn a living through investment business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to refuse or revoke a recognition order would not have the same effect on people's livelihoods. If a self-regulating organisation or a professional body were not recognised, businesses could seek authorisation from another SRO or professional body. In all cases authorisation could be sought from the Secretary of State or the designated agency. Therefore, the need to safeguard against loss of livelihood does not arise on refusal or revocation of a recognition order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, such revocation raises worries for those involved, so there are procedural safeguards. The Secretary of State or designated agency could not, except in an emergency, revoke recognition without giving those concerned the opportunity to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such decisions require the assessment of many complex and wide-ranging criteria, so they are best left to those who are continually involved in regulation. The procedures before revocation and the availability of judicial review of a decision to refuse or revoke recognition provide adequate safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction can be summarised thus: the decisions on matters such as revocation that are left to the Secretary of State or the designated agency are in the nature of the exercise of regulatory powers, which should be in the hands of a regulatory body; the decisions that the tribunal will have to make are analagous to judicial powers, as they will affect the fate of individuals. That is why we have not given a right of appeal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
to the tribunal in the cases described by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same logic answers the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon made. The Bill does not enable an appeal to be made to the tribunal against the direct, ruling power. That power itself is not yet in the Bill, but we have undertaken to consider it in the light of the views that Committee members expressed in the debate on clause 12. We have yet to decide what is the best way of providing that power and the safeguards that ought to be associated with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, it is perhaps unlikely that we shall decide to give the tribunal a role here. The tribunal is better with questions affecting individuals than with purely regulatory functions which are for the Secretary of State or designated agency, with an ultimate right of appeal to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 84 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. You will recall that a few minutes ago my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) asked for your ruling on the presence of someone standing just behind the 	<i>Hansard</i> writer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two points to offer that may help you to decide on your ruling, Sir Michael. We understand that the person referred to is an official from the Government Whips' Office. His conduct was remarkable in that not only was he standing where he was, but he appeared to be checking off a list. It is reasonable to assume that he was checking the presence of some members of the Committee, an he was looking particularly towards the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped your attention, Sir Michael, or that of the Committee, that it is possible that during this sitting or the next, important issues in the Bill will be decided. The amendment paper includes an amendment tabled by some Government Back Benchers which seeks to make an important change to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee needs to know whether what appeared to be an ostentatious course of conduct on the part of the representative of the Government Whips was deliberately designed to put pressure on hon. Members—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am delighted at the ribaldry that the suggestion provokes from Government Benches, but none the less this is serious. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that those Government Back Benchers who intended to vote for their amendment may have been subject to an attempt to persuade them to do otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unusual nature of the conduct of that representative of the Government Whip's Office was a deliberate gesture. If our suspicions are correct, it was an affront not only to those towards whom it was directed, but to the whole Committee, and to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that any such attempt, whether successful or otherwise—however worthy of ridicule—would be an affront. Therefore, through you, Sir Michael, I ask Government Ministers and representatives of the Government Whips' Office to make it clear that no affront was intended, and that the unusual conduct was unconnected with the fact that the Committee is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
approaching this important amendment, debate and Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, was it in order for that official to stand where he was, Sir Michael? We could make no objection if the person concerned had been in the public gallery. He could have done whatever he wished in noting the presence or otherwise of members of the Committee. The fact that he stood where he did is significant as it calls into question whether the official was authorised to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters of some consequence, Sir Michael. I am relieved to see that Government Back Benchers are so prepared to dismiss attempts to suborn them, but nevertheless the Committee must take the matter seriously, and we should like your ruling as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the matter can be disposed of fairly quickly. On the other hand, a point of order has been put seriously and it must be taken seriously. A request has been made; it might be answered by a Conservative Member and it might be helpful if I called someone on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael, I regard what has been said by Opposition Members as bordering on high farce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Low farce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, low farce. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests that Back Benchers might be influenced by the presence of an employee of our Whips' Office coming to the Committee; the hon. Gentleman knows that what he has just said was a complete load of old cobblers. If Back Benchers are likely to be influenced by anyone, it would be by the presence of one of their own Whips in the Committee, but that is not the case. I am sure that we shall all follow our consciences on the matter. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was making a cheap and uncharacteristic party political point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us keep this brief. I hope that the terms in which hon. Members make their contributions will not lead to further points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I do not think that Conservative Members understand what the issue is about. We can all see the amusing side and we shall all join in the laughter. But there is also a serious side: the implications for proceedings of Committees in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, an appointee of the Whips' Office, who is paid by the Crown, but who has a political role, in that he represents the interests of the Whips who wish to maximise a vote in this Committee and other Committees that they may attend, has walked into the body of the Committee and in so doing has entered into the proceedings of the Committee. That is a precedent. The ruling that you will give today, Sir Michael, will go into "Erskine May".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members may laugh and smile, but they misunderstand the significance of what has happened. We are asking for a ruling about the right of a person who is not authorised to enter into our proceedings. We want a ruling to ensure that such a person
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
does not enter into our proceedings. What he has done is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the proceedings of this Committee were paralleled in another Committee, it would mean that in the light of the precedent set today an appointee of the Whips' Office could walk into any Committee of the House and sit through the proceedings of that Committee. Indeed, such a person on another occasion, could ask for a chair—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Conservative Member fail to understand that a precedent is being set by allowing that gentleman access to the Committee. He would then have the right, as is the case with the attendants, to request a chair and to sit on it. He would become part of the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the present position, the only persons who are allowed to attend Committees are the Members, the Chairman, who is an hon. Member, the Clerks who advise the Chair, the attendants who service the Committee, civil servants who advise Ministers, and the Hansard reporter. There is no authorisation for any other person to enter into the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want it placed firmly on the record that what has happened today is wrong. I ask you for a ruling, Sir Michael, that what has happened is not in order and that it be reported to the House and entered as a judgment, so that at no stage in the future will there be a parallel incident in any other Committee of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it might help Conservative Members if I cite a parallel in a wider context. If an appointee of the Liberal, Labour or Conservative Whips' Office were to stand in the Division Lobbies of the House of Commons during a Division what would be the response of hon. Members? In my view, there would be a series of points of order on the Floor of the House, followed by an argument about the quasi-political nature of those appointees in the Whips' Office. That would be a valid argument, which would lead to a debate and Mr. Speaker would have to rule. I ask you, Sir Michael, to rule on a similar basis today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. The far-fetched analogy made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) falls immediately, because no right is given to a civil servant advising a Minister to stand in the Division Lobby of the House. As he conceded, a civil servant advising the Minister has a right to attend the Committee's proceedings. My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) is a Minister, and the gentleman to whom we have referred is entitled to attend, in his capacity as a civil servant advising a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that occurrence that leads to any affront to my hon. Friends, but the suggestion made by Opposition Members, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) has made it clear. I was surprised by the tones in which the matter was put by Opposition Members. I thought that they intended to connect the presence of the gentleman to whom we have referred with my absence from, and subsequent return to, the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has gone on quite long enough. I obtained a conjuncture of those people interested and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
present at the time, and was about to give a ruling in any case. But, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) raised the matter, I thought that it was courteous and in the Committee's interest to accept a few points of order to allow hon. Members to express their feelings properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked into the matter and refreshed my memory on Standing Orders, and I also discovered the status of the gentleman who entered the room. I was, therefore, able to reach a conclusion. It may help the Committee if I go through the advice that I have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament—with the concurrence of the Chairman—clerks, draftsmen and officials of the Government Departments interested in the Bills may use the dais. When private Members are in charge of Bills, their advisers have been allowed in the past to use the dais. 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters are also allowed to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangers are admitted to Standing Committees, but they are not admitted to the part of the room reserved for hon. Members. Any lady or gentleman who entered the room by the Members' door would be out of order because he or she would come into an area reserved for hon. Members and, by definition, those helping hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in this case, having made inquiries about the status of the gentleman who entered the room, I found that he was a civil servant employed by the Treasury, and the Treasury is specifically interested in the Bill. As I understand it, whatever else the gentleman was alleged to have been doing, he was inquiring about how far the Bill had got. It would have been a matter for the Chair to judge whether he sits here, but, in view of the fact that he is an official of a Government Department interested in the Bill, he is entitled to enter through the "Members' Entrance", do what he has to do and then depart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my ruling. If it is recorded in "Erskine May" so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I am grateful for your ruling. You said that if the person concerned had been a stranger his actions would have been improper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So he has to show that he is an employee or an official of a Government Department that is interested in the Bill. As I understand it, your ruling is that as a civil servant in the Government Whips' Office is technically employed by the Treasury, he can claim to be employed by a Government Department interested in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to imagine a Bill in which the Treasury would not be interested. Your ruling suggests that any paid employee of the government Whips' Office would be entitled to stand in that position and to sit on the dais with your approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a surprising ruling, at least to Opposition Members, because of its implications. It suggests that representatives of the Government Whips' Office have privileges that are not accorded to representatives of other Whips' Offices. The fact that this gentleman is employed by the Treasury is the merest technicality. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
is more accurate to say that he is employed by the Civil Service Department, although I concede that that is, in effect, the same thing. The Treasury's substantive interest in the Bill was not the basis on which he was standing there and carrying out his functions as a representative of the Government Whips' Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain ingenuity has been shown by those who have sought to show that the gentleman concerned is to be regarded on the same basis as the civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry who are quite properly sitting beside you, Sir Michael. We are very unhappy with your ruling. I understand the process of reasoning by which you reached it, but its implications carry us very far indeed and are most unfortunate for the proper proceedings of the Committee and of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further issue has yet to be raised. When you kindly responded to my initial point of order, you invited a representative of the Government or of the Government Whips' Office to assure the Committee that the gentleman's purpose in standing there was, as we now understand, connected with his functions as employee of the Treasury who was interested in the Bill's progress. Some of us suspect that that was not his purpose, which was suggested by the fact that he was ticking off names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the robust terms in which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) and all Conservative Members rejected the suggestion. I should be desolated if I thought that any Conservative Members felt under pressure as a result of this performance. But we are concerned not with the effect of such pressure but with whether the fact that that gentleman stood there doing something that was extremely difficult to see falls within the general rubric which you outlined, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister finally contributed to the debate, he manifestly stopped short of assuring the Committee that that gentleman was not doing what we suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not state finally what the gentleman was doing. I said that I had been told the main object of what he was doing. I deliberately left any other point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to make the following observations. We do not want a general debate on the matter. I have given a ruling. However, it is an unusual matter. I have sat through many Bills and have seen similar things happening under Governments of both parties. I cannot remember whether the gentlemen concerned came through the Members Entrance or through the Public Entrance, but they were certainly within the room. The significance of the door through which anyone pops up is being exaggerated, but I do not want to give a ruling. It may be important to some hon. Members. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to the anomaly in his mind which he considered unsatisfactory—namely, the different treatment between officials from different Whips' Offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, in saying that, he opens up a wide field. It is not for me to interpret the status of employees in all the Whips' Offices. That matter is wider than the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ruling that I have given stems from the very difference that has always existed between the Whips'

offices. I have gone into some detail. My ruling cannot be challenged—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point or order, Sir Michael. I have no way set out to delay the progress of the Bill, and I raise this matter quite legitimately. The fact that there are precedents for the conduct is not relevant—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that there were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman said that there were precedents, and I am replying to what he said as Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether I am right or wrong is not relevant. The Chairman has ruled, and he says that there are precedents. However, the fact that there have been precedents is not relevant, Sir Michael, because it may well be that the procedures that we have been adopting over the years do not comply with the rules. It may be that only today has an hon. Member drawn attention to something that does not fall within the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask you, Sir Michael, to consider the implications of your ruling, and rule again on another occasion to that we do not have to delay our debate today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has raised an interesting question, and I think that the whole question of Whips—Labour Whips and Liberal Whips equally—having their appointees—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now going wide. I sought to explain that that is not a matter for the Committee. If the matter is to be debated, it must be somewhere else, and not today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay great tribute to you as a Chairman, Sir Michael, but perhaps you did not grasp the point that I was trying to make. This is a matter which falls within the purview of a debate on this particular point of order, because the issues have been raised of Whips' appointees being present during the course of our proceedings in part of the Room which is devoted to the proceedings of the Committee. The issue of whether Liberal and Labour Whips appointees have equal access is one on which I believe that we have right to a ruling. I do not believe that it is possible for you to take the decision today, Sir Michael, as a Pandora's box of issues has been opened by your ruling and they need detailed reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you consider your ruling, Sir Michael, and perhaps return to it at a later stage? Otherwise this debate may unfortunately be prolonged by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear that this is not a debate, but a point of order. I have ruled on it, and I stand by my ruling. Other matters may arise from my ruling, and, if hon. Members wish to take them up elsewhere, that is a matter for them and not for me. I have this morning ruled on the facts of the incident and that ruling must stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I rise to support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and the concern that he and the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
Member for Workingham (Mr. Campbell-Savours) have expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I in no way seek to question your ruling, Sir Michael, but it does turn on what the hon. Member for Dagenham has called a technicality, but what we might term the Government's sophistry. I find it odd that it should be claimed that the gentleman was keeping a check on the Bill from the Treasury's point of view, but we cannot challenge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why you, Sir Michael, say that you cannot take into account the issue of equal rights for Whips of all parties, but that is central to my concern and, I expect, that of all Opposition Members. You have ruled that the behaviour was in order, Sir Michael, and it would be nice to have some recognition from the Government that although what was done was technically in order, it was an abuse of a technical power. At least the Government should have shown some contrition. Instead, the Minister made a bald statement in a tone that suggested, "This is our power and we shall use it." It would have been more pleasant to hear the Government say that, although technically in order, this power should not be used again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(8) Any person in respect of whom and any organisation, professional body, investment exchange, clearing house, unit trust scheme or other scheme in respect of which or of whose members there is an entry in the register shall be under a duty to report to the Secretary of State the particulars of any change in the details to be recorded in the register within one month of that change occurring.".</p></q>
The register is an important measure which should be as effective as possible. The purpose of the amendment is to make the register more effective. The precedence for similar registers causes us anxiety. For example, the requirement to register details of companies seems to be largely ignored. At the last count no fewer than 400,000 companies had failed to file the required documents with Companies House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The analogy is not an exact one. Nevertheless, it shows the difficulties in providing a complete register of information if there are no clear and enforceable rules to ensure that such information is accurate and up-to-date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to place on those whose details appear in the register a duty to notify any changes to the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Minister will satisfy me that other provisions in the Bill cover this point, or that relevant rules will be made under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
rule-making provisions. Clause 92 and other provisions will allow the Secretary of State to demand information in certain circumstances, but that will not deal with entries that passively remain on the register without any change in circumstances being reported and recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot tell me how this matter will be dealt with, I hope that he will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the point made by the hon. Gentleman. However, there are two different issues. The problem with the companies' resgistry is not that there is no duty, but that it is difficult to enforce a duty, especially with insufficient resources. I believe that it is a criminal offence not to register documents on time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I take his point entirely. There is a secondary problem, to which he has drawn attention. However, my argument is that, if one does not have the duty in the first place, there is no opportunity for enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that and I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's proposal, as it is the first step. Authorised investment businesses must have some obligation to register the details and to keep them up to date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He has brought forward an important amendment. The updating of the register in a form which is most useful and usable is essential to the proper operation of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will assure us about the matter. If he does not, and the hon. Member for Dagenham pushes it to a vote, I shall support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the reasons that have been advanced for placing a duty on all registered persons and organisations to report changes that affect their entries on the registers within a specified period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Committee members who support the amendment may have overlooked the provisions that are already in the Bill and the powers available to the Secretary of State or designated agency if functions are transferred to make rules and regulations for the production of information. The notification regulations under clause 48 apply to all directly authorised persons, clause 14 requires recognised SROs to provide information about their members, and clause 20 makes it the duty of recognised professional bodies to notify information about their members as required by the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases changes will not need to be notified for the register, as they will be the result of action taken by the Secretary of State or the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect the rules on the production of information for the register to include time limits. It is not necessary to include a deadline in the Bill. In some circumstances it would be an advantage to require new information to be placed on the register more quickly than the time that the amendment specifies. The Bill includes stricter obligations on time, for example, in clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I share the object of that Committee members have expressed—that the register should be as up to date and complete as possible—the amendment is unnecessary to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, who has given the answer that I expected and hoped for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only "i" that needs dotting, or "t" that needs crossing, is the assurance, which I understood him to give, that the rule-making power under clause 48 will refer to the register. That small connection may be missing, unless the rules make it clear that changes will be reflected in the register. I think that the Minister has that in mind, and that the rules will state it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention. The power in clause 48 is sufficient to achieve that object. If anyone doubts it, we shall be happy to look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INSPECTION OF REGISTER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 66, line 40, leave out subsections (3) and (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ask my honourable and learned Friend the Under-Secretary to explain the reason for restricting access to information in the register, and the use to which that information may be put by a person inspecting the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information in the register appears to be perfectly normal, and not unduly sensitive. If we are to indulge as far as possible in open government, we should ensure that the public have a right to inspect the register to protect their rights. Similarly, I see no reason why there should be a restriction on the use to which a person should put the information in the register. My amendment seeks, therefore, to delete those two restrictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for tabling this amendment because it gives me an opportunity to say a few words about public access and inspection of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register of authorised persons and recognised bodies will be an important public record. The SIB, in their maroon book, "Regulation of Investment Business", has already said that it is its intention—if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
designated—to publish the lists in printed form at least annually, with more regular updates. It also intends to make the register available in a computer—readable form on a continuous basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the register will be available to public inspection without restriction. But the clause limits inspection of that part of the register which deals with individuals who are, or have been, subject to a direction disqualifying them from being employed in connection with investment business, or investment business of a specific kind. Subsection (2) of the clause enables anyone to check whether a person is currently disqualified. Subsection (3) enables anyone who has a good reason to inspect entries about disqualification more generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises whether it is right to open the list to general inspection for those, by definition, without a good reason, who wish to examine the list for mere idle curiosity. In answering that question, we must bear in mind that reasons for disqualification will vary considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, disqualification may not be outright, but may be restricted to the ability to carry on specific kinds of investment business. Secondly, the reasons for disqualification will vary from incompetence to dishonesty. As the register may not specify the reason for disqualification, the question arises whether it is right that someone should be lumped together with a group of people who have been disqualified for dishonesty, if he has been disqualified from carrying out only some kinds of investment business for reasons of incompetence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reasoning that led to the inclusion of the subsection in the Bill. It appears to serve a useful purpose, but it is a matter on which it is possible to hold different views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend says that there is no difficulty about subsection (2), but we do not know how extensive the list will be. Under that subsection, an inquirer will have to ask about a specific person, and use the right name. If I am listed as T. J. Smith, a prohibited person, and the inquirer fails to get my initials right, he will not know that I am a prohibited person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the operation of subsection (2). My hon. and learned Friend says that it could be damaging to some people, especially if the only reason that they have been prohibited is that they are deemed to be incompetent in respect of a certain type of investment business, although it is difficult to believe that a prospective employer would be interested in employing someone in commodity futures if that person had been found incompetent in another part of investment business. Is my hon. and learned Friend saying that an employer may overlook that and believe that the prospective employee would be good at something else? There is a difficult balance to be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend glossed over the matter slightly and said that there was no problem over subsection (2), but I think that there is. The person must be defined accurately or inquiries might be made about Mr. X and, because the inquirer did not get his name right, or because he had been operating under six different names recently and the inquirer did not choose the one under which he was prohibited, the relevant information to which the inquirer was entitled would not be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, remain anxious. Investigative journalists may wish to inspect the register. They may not be able to show good reasons in relation to a specific inquiry, but, in pursuit of a line of investigation, they may wish to inspect the register generally. I remain unconvinced that there should not be a general right of the public to have access. I do not think that we should be slandering anyone, but if a person had been disqualified, for whatever reason, the public should have a right to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee and I am fairly persuaded of what the Minister has said. Perhaps the provisions do not need amendment, but there is a nice balance to be struck here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that either an inquirer specifies very accurately the precise name in which he is interested or, by virtue of subsection (3), he must offer a good reason; there is no intermediate case. I can see why it is difficult, or perhaps impossible, to have an intermediate case, but the effect of subsection (3) is that without a precise name there is no general righ inquiry. Can the Minister say whether there would be recognised good grounds so that not every inquirer would have to surmount a considerable hurdle before he could get access to the register?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an assurance in the terms requested by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), but I am encouraged by this short debate to think that we have got it right in the Bill and that the clause should remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked about people who may engage in investment business under a series of different names. If someone is using an alias an inquirer cannot get him by inspecting the register. A request can be made to ask whether a certain person had been disqualified. A person must be authorised to carry out investment business in a particular name. As he will be disqualified from carrying out investment business in the same name as that in which he was originally authorised, that should not present insuperable problems. If there is genuine uncertainty about the name, that might constitute good reasons for an application to search more widely under subsection (3). One would expect it to be treated as good reason and expect subsection (3) to cover that circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, a bona fide investigative journalist—the example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill)—should have no difficulty in establishing good reason, within the meaning of subsection (3), for being permitted to make a general examination of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield may have sought to ridicule the extent to which partial disqualification would be overlooked, but it is not fanciful to suppose that someone who may be disqualified from carrying out business in futures, options, or some of the more recondite categories may be perfectly qualified to sell unit trusts or life insurance. There would be no question that that individual was dishonest.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of the clause, which are essential to protect investors, form an important part of the powers of the Secretary of State or any designated agency. We should not pass this clause without expressing the importance that we all attach to the need for adequate powers of investigation into both authorised and unauthorised business, and I mention that, because under clause 96 we will discover that the powers of investigation that can be delegated to an agent apply only to investigation of authorised people. Even then, the Secretary of State retains his power to investigate those matters concurrently. Under that clause, the delegated agency has no power to investigate unauthorised businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that the question of investigation should be seen as a totality. In my view, it is improper to fetter the investigative powers of the Secretary of State—which this clause does not do—or of a delegated agency. For example, in some circumstances it is essential to ascertain whether a person who appears to be operating an investment business is doing so and whether he should apply for authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, rightly, allows himself wide powers of investigation under this clause. He can call for people to come before him, he can call for papers to be presented by those people, he can even ask a bank to disclose details of a customer where those details are relevant to a decision about whether there has been an infringement of this legislation. He provides, and reserves, for himself the power to investigate authorised investment businesses and, in fact, all persons. Subsection (i) says:
	<br><q><p>"The powers of the Secretary of State under this section shall be exercisable in any case where it appears to him that there is good reason to do so".</p></q>
However, the powers accorded to a delegated agency are severely curtailed. The notes on clauses explain that the delegated agency is regarded as a private sector body and, unlike the Secretary of State or the Department of Trade and Industry, it is not an authorised statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
It is important to lay down a marker now. Great importance should attach to the investigative powers of the Secretary of State. Where those powers are delegated, they should not be limited for any delegated agency. If that means that the status of the delegated agency has to be changed to enable it to take on the whole powers of investigation, the Committee should seriously consider the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary confirm that there will be adequate manpower resources to enable the functions of the clause to be adequately discharged? Examples cited earlier have shown the recent anxiety that the manpower resources available for investigations of undesirable and fraudulent activities have been inadequate. I believe that they have been improved recently, and I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend could comment on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary satisfied that he will have the power to investigate on an international basis, which may prove necessary? Questions of extra-territorial powers are extraordinarily difficult. I said earlier that we were dealing with international markets. It would be vastly naive to suppose that it was adequate to consider the problems on an insular basis. There will inevitably be limitations on extending the authority of the Government, and still more on extending the authority of an agency designated by the Government to carry out such responsibilities on an international basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time we must face the reality as reported in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 4 March. The article said that
	<br><q><p>"Organised rings of professionals spanning several City institutions have been carrying out large share transactions on the basis of inside information through their own offshore dealing companies, the Stock Exchange has claimed.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Mr. Michael Feltham, of the exchange's surveillance department said: 'Time and again our investigations have run up against a brick wall of an offshore company whose true ownership we cannot discover. We can track down the small insider deals which are done in this country, but the big fish go offshore'."</p></q>
The article continues:
	<br><q><p>"Of the 284 full-scale investigations carried out since insider dealing was made a criminal offence in 1980, the Stock Exchange says that about 50 have been frustrated by the use of offshore companies."</p></q>

Those not so authorised will be subject to the investigative powers of the Secretary of State, which will not be transferable to the designated agency.

Although that is an important distinction, it is unlikely to give rise to any practical difficulties because clause 93 enables the Secretary of State to appoint a member of the agency staff to use his wider investigative powers on his behalf. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that that provides a practical solution to his problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must be satisified about the matter of resources before he can transfer any of his powers to the designated agency. That is the answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). No doubt the Secretary of State will pay careful attention to that matter.

My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford on Avon (Mr. Howarth) raised the question of the use of powers internationally, but the Bill cannot provide for that. It can seek only to provide adequate powers to deal with those matters within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom courts. But my hon. Friend may take some comfort from the provision in clause 149(6), which enables the transfer of information from the designated agency to regulatory agencies in other countries. I hope that that provision will be used to the full so that regulatory agencies in different countries will combine to make the most effective use, across frontiers, of information that comes to their attention.

My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) asked a specific question relating to numbers of staff. I am unlikely to be able to answer his question this morning or, indeed, in any future sitting. I hope that he will take comfort from the fact that the Department of Trade and Industry has recently increased its investigative staff by 192, if I remember correctly, and that he will take that as an earnest of the seriousness of the Department's intention to tackle those matters with the necessary vigour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister about subsection (1). The matter is important because there will be discussion on how the SIB and other bodies will be funded. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that they should be funded on a free-standing basis by the state. The other view, represented by the Minister, is that they should be paid for by the City. I am tempted to the view that they should be paid for by the City, because to allow the clammy hands of the Treasury to fall upon the funding would not be wise. That is my initial view and I shall enlarge upon it when we discuss the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 95(1) contains the interesting provision:
	<br><q><p>"shall pay such periodical fees to the Secretary of State as may be prescribed".</p></q>
The Secretary of State will delegate the powers as part of his delegative powers. Must he delegate en bloc the powers that may be prescribed or is it possible for him to delegate some of those powers and retain for himself a reserve power to prescribe fees if he thinks that insufficient resources have been allowed for regulation? I should like clarification of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a most important part of the framework of the Bill, to which we shall no doubt return shortly and which far transcends in its significance even the important point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, that the Secretary of State should be able to transfer his powers in whole or in part. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
