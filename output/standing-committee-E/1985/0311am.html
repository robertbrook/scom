Standing Committee E</div> <!-- title -->
<time>Tuesday 11 March 1986</time>

<p>[MR JAMES LAMOND <i>in the Chair]</i></p>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Financial Services Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. At our last sitting we accepted an amendment to clause No. 96, which has in some ways changed the thrust of the Bill.<br><br>
Technically the amendment does not have a far-reaching effect in giving an identity to the SIB and in limiting the discretion of the Secretary of State in choosing the body to which he may delegate his powers. However, it has changed the regulatory structure in the Bill, and the speeches supporting the amendment advanced the argument in favour of a statutory commission, although I concede that the amendment does not achieve that effect. That leaves the Committee with a difficulty that I should like to raise with you now, Mr. Lamond.<br><br>
The Committee must be told the Government's attitude to the amendment, as we are coming to clauses 97 to 100 which complete the provisions on the delegation of powers, and we shall also examine schedules 5 to 7 which deal with the status, powers and functions of a designated agency.<br><br>
Some members of the Committee will wish to build upon the amendment and thus to press forward with the logic of the amendment; others, perhaps including the Minister, may wish to restrict the amendment to its current effect; a third group, of which the Minister is also perhaps a member, may wish to ignore the amendment, and hope that it will be reversed in due course.<br><br>
The Committee cannot make progress unless we know which of those three options is most likely to be pursued. The Minister may respond to me by confirming what I understand he told the press—that the Government intend to reverse the amendment on Report. I very much hope that he will not take that line.<br><br>
The Minister may say that as the amendment has been accepted, the Government will not try to remove it even though they do not like it. He may say that it is of limited effect, but that some tidying-up and redrafting is required.<br><br>
The third option is for the Minister to say that the Government accept the amendment, see the sense in the argument and concede that some further substantial amendments are required to convert SIB from its status as a private company, limited by guarantee, into a statutory commission defined in the Bill.<br><br>
Can the Minister convey to the Committee the Government's likely attitude to the amendment? Without the guidance, we shall find ourselves in grave difficulties in knowing how to deal with the provisions we are just coming to.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Nelson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. I support the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I believe that my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would do the C0ommittee and the public a service by showing more restraint than was indicated by his reported remarks on the amendment accepted at our last sitting. I readily concede that my hon. and learned Friend may be concerned about the extent to which the amendment will be built on, but many of his hon. Friends, including myself, have made clear the limitations that we want to see imposed on the extent to which the measure is used as a major rule-making and authoritative power of SIB. That view will be reflected by later amendments and a new schedule.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham that it would be unfortunate and would appear to ride a little roughshod over the views of a Standing Committee if my hon. and learned Friend were to reject an amendment passed so recently with all-party support, albeit narrowly. The approval of the amendment shows that it must have some merit. I suggest that before my hon. and learned Friend makes a final decision, he should make no clear commitment that he will definitely reverse the amendment on Report; nor do I ask him to say specifically that he will not do so. It is important that we wait to see how the Bill emerges from the Committee and that we assess the extent to which hon. Members outside the Committee and the opinions of the City and of the public move in response to last week's events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want this to develop from a point of order into a full-scale debate, but I should allow the Minister to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to you, Mr. Lamond, and I echo the words of welcome to you uttered by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).<br><br>
I am happy to respond to the invitation extended by the hon. Gentleman and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) for showing me the extent and nature of the changes that he would make to the Bill if his wishes were accepted in their entirety. He and I are not completely at one on the significance of those changes and on the extent to which they would represent a major shift in the Bill.<br><br>
I have carefully considered and reflected on our previous debate. The amendment to clause 96 would make it impossible for the Secretary of State to transfer his powers, in whole or in part, to any agency other than SIB, either initially or subsequently. It remains my view that the amendment would reduce the accountability of the designated agency. I understand that that might be regarded as strengthening the agency, but I believe that it would weaken the regulatory regime which the Bill seeks to provide, and to reduce its flexibility.<br><br>
It is therefore my clear duty to seek to persuade the House on Report to restore clause 96 to its original form, which I shall endeavour to do. It is also right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0315">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 705</span>
that I should make my intentions clear to the Committee so that hon. Members are in no doubt about my position or under any misapprehension about what I shall seek to do on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I am sorry to press the issue, but many of us regard the amendment as central to the Bill and it was the focus of much debate on Second Reading. I wish to say a few words on a point of order to seek your guidance, Mr. Lamond.<br><br>
When the Committee commenced, I, like some other hon. Members, made it clear that I did not intend to make lengthy interventions—as I do on Finance Bill Committees and others. I thought it important that Conservative Members should be given every opportunity to speak freely, in a way that the procedures of the House rarely allow. Therefore, during many debates when I wanted to intervene I contained myself and remained seated, believing that the debate was being helped by the freedom of speech on the Conservative Benches.<br><br>
I hoped that the amendment would be carried, as it was, but it was obviously carried as a result not of the debate in the Committee but of the debate that raged outside—even among Conservative Members in private, across dinner tables, in the City, in their clubs and elsewhere. They all engaged in a debate, drew a conclusion and laid themselves on the line on a principle.<br><br>
When such an amendment is carried by the Committee after the fullest possible consideration and consultation, it is wrong for a Minister to come back to the Committee and say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: And to tell <i>The Sunday Times</i> first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only <i>The Sunday Times.</i> The Minister was briefing the press outside the Committee Room within minutes of his defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is taking the discussion beyond the bounds of a point of order and widening it into a debate, and I must stop him. I allowed a point of order from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) because I felt that it would help the running of the Committee if the Minister were to make his position clear. He made it crystal clear, so there is no point in any further point of order on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. My point of order is that the Minister will use the whipping system on the Floor of the House to overturn a judgment of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for me. It is a perfectly straightforward question that will be decided on the Floor of the House, not in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that it was a matter for you, Mr. Lamond.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman come to his point of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the Committee cannot proceed on that basis. It must proceed on the basis that the Bill will be as amended. The matter affects our deliberations in the numerous provisions where the nature of the designated agency will be essential in our considerations. We cannot proceed to discuss the Bill until the matter is dealt with, because it affects the nature of speeches surrounding the moving of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it does, and that at least three major debates to come will be affected by our decision on the matter. Hon. Members will have to argue two cases. The Securities and Investments Board will have to adopt the role that the Committee by a majority has set for it or the role that the Minister would wish to set for it if he were to use the whipping system of the House of Commons to overturn a Committee decision.<br><br>
It is not just a question of the Minister rising to his feet and saying, "Blow the amendment, I am not interested. We shall overturn it, and we shall proceed with the Bill on that basis." I do not believe that we can proceed on that basis in a democratic institution such as the House of Commons. The Committee should be suspended, the Minister should take stock, and a statement should be made on the Floor of the House about future arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to suspend the Committee in response to that point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. It would have helped the Committee if last Thursday's proceedings could have been made available today. I appreciate that there are difficulties in printing. However, not only was I missing on Thursday afternoon, but the <i>Hansard</i> of what occurred is also missing. I would help if some representations could be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to the difficulties in providing the printed records of our sittings quickly. I understand that the record of last Thursday's sitting will be available during the morning.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. If I were normally asked to choose between the importance of the absence of the <i>Hansard</i> and the absence of the hon. Gentelman, hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), I should have no doubt in choosing the former. However, in the precise circumstances that obtained on Thursday, I must say that I waver.<br><br>
The Committee—and, with respect, you as Chairman, Mr. Lamond—are placed in a dilemma by what the Minister has said. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 707</span>
right to say that the Committee is entitled to proceed to consider the succeeding provisions on the basis that our view of what should be in the Bill will prevail. But we have had the clearest possible statement from the Minister that that assumption is misplaced.<br><br>
We all know that as my hon. Friend has pointed out the Minister intends to wheel in an uninformed majority on the Floor of the House to overturn the consequences of the hard and detailed work of the Committee. In a sense, I make no complaint about that, because it is done by Governments all the time and it is a hazard that all Committees face. We are in the difficult, although not unique, position of wishing to consider schedules 5 to 7—which define the activities, functions, powers and composition of "a" designated agency—on the basis defined by the amendment made at our last sitting. However, we know from what the Minister has said that we are virtually wasting our time if we do that.<br><br>
You, Mr. Lamond, and the rest of the Committee are in danger of spending the next three, four, five or six hours—perhaps longer—looking at a set of provisions on a totally false basis. Through you, I urge the Minister to tell us that he is not intent on simply overturning the Committee's work, and wasting its time, and that he will at least retain an open mind. Ideally I would like him to say that he will help the Committee, on the basis of what has been decided and what has been achieved, to make the Bill work well on that new basis. That would be the most constructive thing that he could do and would incidentally receive a wide welcome well beyond the confines of this Committee—not only in the House, but outside.<br><br>
If the Minister is not prepared to take that constructive view, I hope that he will not adhere to the essentially destructive view that he has just put forward which would place the Committee in a very difficult position. Many of us would feel that we were literally wasting our time and that the best thing we could do would be simply to do nothing until we reached the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). However, I believe that that would be a derogation of duty, because the Committee would in effect be saying that an important chunk of the Bill was no longer of any use or interest to us because the Minister and the Committee were at odds, and could not agree on a way in which the matter could be dealt with constructively.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will think again and will assure the Committee that he is not in effect chopping off our legs and making it impossible for us to do anything sensible. I hope that he will at least keep an open mind and allow us to have a proper debate on the provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I believe that the Committee is not faced with quite the difficulty that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has described. My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary is obviously perfectly entitled to take the line that the amendment that was made at our last sitting is unacceptable to the Government, though I regret that he has done so. Clearly he has not had time to consult other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
Conservative Members of Parliament—I have found considerable sympathy among those to whom I have spoken for what is proposed—nor has he had time to consult outside the House of Commons.<br><br>
However, the Minister has taken that course, and I believe that the Committee should now build on that amendment. If we look at the alternative proposal in detail—I have tabled a new schedule which considers the implications of the amendment—we shall see that some of the Minister's arguments against the amendment are not as valid as he believes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. If we proceed on the basis of what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said, we shall be working on a different Bill from the one that the Minister has in mind. We shall be working at cross-purposes. We all know that Ministers—the executive—drive a legislative steamroller. Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets. The job of Opposition Back Benchers is to heckle the driver of the steamroller, and that of Conservative Back Benchers is to oil the wheels of the steamroller and to stop it slipping back.<br><br>
We know that the Minister will probably get his way on Report, which means that the proceedings of the Committee are futile. Therefore, will you, Mr. Lamond, accept a motion for the Adjournment of the Committee until the Minister has clarified his intentions by a statement in the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am in no dilemma. An amendment has been successfully moved. I and other Chairmen accept amendments on the basis of whether they are valid. We must proceed in the normal way with the examination of the Bill. I think that this point of order has been sufficiently aired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I wish to pursue the matter that I previously raised because it is of constitutional importance. I am advised that there are precedents of an issue central to a Bill being changed by an amendment and the Bill being withdrawn. The Minister may smile, but an amendment has been carried which changes the framework on which we are basing our discussions. The Minister shakes his head. He would do better to check the records. If they show that there are precedents, the Minister may shake his head but he obviously does not understand the issue. I am supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) who moved that we should adjourn the Committee. If there are precedents, the Minister should make a statement to Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no motion for an Adjournment, and I will not accept such a motion. The question whether to adjourn the Committee is not for the Chairman; it is a matter of political judgment. The Government have not suggested that they wish to adjourn the Committee. Therefore, this point of order has been fully exhausted. I allowed it so that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) could ascertain the Minister's attitude on the amendment. That has now been made clear and we must proceed on that basis.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I appreciate your desire not to have a substantial debate on this point of order. I am grateful for your consideration of what has been said. I appreciate the directness of your ruling, but I regret that the Minister responded as he did to your invitation to make clear his attitude.<br><br>
The chances of producing a Bill, endorsed in broad terms by both sides of the Committee, are, therefore, much reduced. It would have been possible if the Government had moved with us in trying to secure the general objective introduced by the amendment to clause 96. The Committee may not now work on the same constructive basis of accepting the decisions reached.<br><br>
The Minister is a Committee member, and it is an affront to the Committee that he should tell us clearly that he intends to overrule a decision taken by it. I renew my invitation to him to say a few further words to the Committee to help us escape from the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Ashdown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Yeovil)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I want to reinforce the comments of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), in hoping that the Minister will think again about his decision not to reconsider, because it will have precisely the implications suggested by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
If the Minister reconsiders the issue, he may find that matters will be rather easier for him than they will be otherwise, because his hon. Friends may now consider and support amendments reinforcing the change in the Bill, so that it will be difficult for him to unstitch matters when the Bill is debated on Report. His hon. Friends may, therefore, reinforce the movement carried forward in clause 96.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider, for his purposes and those of the Committee, his blanket refusal to consider the possibility of allowing the measure to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. It is my duty to the Committee to make my position clear. I have not said that I would be prepared to reconsider matters, unless I genuinely intended to do so. I intend to seek to persuade the House on Report to restore clause 96 to its original state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. When the Committee has passed amendments, perhaps against the Government's judgment, the Minister has, quite rightly, not felt obliged to tell us whether he takes one view or another. It has been assumed, for the purposes of debate, that we should proceed on the basis that an amendment is in place. I am grateful that the Minister has responded to my point of order, but it shows that we are talking about not just any old amendment. It is central to the Bill; the structure of the Bill depends on the nature of the body that will exercise those powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>:<i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister concedes that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 710</span>
point by what he has just said—that he felt obliged on this occasion to make clear his intentions. Given that the Minister is in charge of the Bill, at least from the Government's side, he must follow through the logic of his comments. In view of the peculiar nature of the amendment, he feels obliged to make it clear to the Committee that he intends to overturn it, but he must then live with the consequence of that, and he places the Committee in an impossible situation.<br><br>
As the Minister is in charge of the Bill and, in many ways, of the Committee's proceedings, he is responsible for advising the Committee how we should now proceed. It is now difficult for Opposition Members to discuss sensibly schedules 5, 6 and 7, when we know that the basis on which we intend to discuss those matters, which we made clear by passing the amendment to clause 96, represents one view, but the Minister takes a different view. We are, therefore, obliged to discuss the provisions on what is, to us, a false basis.<br><br>
The Minister has placed the Committee in this dilemma, and must now advise us how we are to resolve it. Are we to go on discussing at great length a series of amendments, new clauses and new schedules all designed to produce an SIB along the lines supported in Thursday's debate, knowing that the whole process is futile? The Minister cannot see that as a sensible use of the Committee's—or even his own—time. Will he tell us how we can spend our time usefully on the Bill?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. The Minister has just told us, in effect, that our proceedings in this Committee are futile. We have accepted an amendment that is essential to the Bill. We hope that we can proceed to modify the rest of the Bill on the basis of the new structure, which is much better than that originally in the Bill. However, the Minister now says that he aint going to play the game, that he is going to sulk and that he will take it all out.<br><br>
If we are to proceed on that basis, the rest of our proceedings will be a waste of time. I asked you earlier, Mr. Lamond, about moving an adjournment. Surely it would be sensible for the Committee to adjourn and continue later in the light of the Government's intentions, after they have justified those intentions to the House of Commons.<br><br>
I beg to move, That further consideration be adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the point of order that we have been debating for the past 31 minutes has been satisfactorily dealt with and I should like to proceed. That means that we move to amendment No. 43, in the name—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I have moved the adjournment of the Committee. Can that motion now be debated, as it contains an important principle?</span></p>

Schedule 5</div> <!-- schedule -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
QUALIFICATIONS OF DESIGNATED AGENCY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 140, line 22, leave out from 'State' to end of line 23. The amendment illustrates the difficulties identified in our point of order.<br><br>
Schedule 5 deals with the composition of a" designated agency on the assumption that there may be many candidates for the role. The schedule lays down ground rules for the composition of such a designated agency, which might one day catch the eye of the Secretary of State, and be made the subject of a designating order.<br><br>
The reality is that we know that at least for the time being, we are not discussing any old designated agency, but the Securities and Investments Board. What we do not know is whether SIB will remain a private company limited by guarantee or whether, as a consequence of further amendments, new clauses and new schedules it will become a body set up under the Bill. Therefore we are discussing schedule 5 in limbo, as we do not know what sort of body we are contemplating.<br><br>
However, in the light of your ruling, Mr. Lamond, and of the Minister's reply to the Committee, we are obliged to go through the motions of examining schedule 5 on an undefined basis. I assume that we are discussing some form of SIB which is, for the time being, a private company limited by guarantee, but which must comply with the provisions of schedule 5, yet it is the only body that could be required to do so. One sees immediately the difficulties, doubts and uncertainties that face us.<br><br>
The schedule provides that members of the governing body of the designated agency should be appointed—and dismissed—jointly by the Secretary of State and the governor of the Bank of England. My amendment seeks to remove the role played by the Bank of England from that provision. The amendment deals with a precise point and has little to do with the broader issues that we have been debating. However, I think that the Committee should take a view on it.<br><br>
The purpose of the provision is to try to ensure that there is some co-ordination of views by the Secretary of State and by the governor of the Bank of England on how the SIB should operate. The two supervisory agencies should not be working at cross purposes. I have some sympathy with that aim. But the coincidence of the two supervisory agencies is likely to be assured more by practical considerations than by any artificial provision.<br><br>
The Secretary of State or the SIB will be administering the Bill's provisions across the whole range of financial services. At the same time, and over a similar area, the Bank of England will be supervising all institutions which provide banking services. The City of London will in future be composed largely of sizeable financial conglomerates, many of which will be offering banking services. And the Bank of England has made it clear that where it supervises an institution offering banking services, it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 712</span>
would be prudent—in the light of Johnson Matthey, no doubt—to supervise the institution's related activities as well.<br><br>
That could result in the very duality of supervision across the City which schedule 5 is presumably designed to implement. In other words, the provision in schedule 5 will play little part in affecting what is to happen anyway. It may be desirable or it may not, but most financial institutions in the City will be subjected to at least two separate forms of supervision, administered on the one hand by the Secretary of State or the SIB and on the other hand by the governor of the Bank of England.<br><br>
If that is so, we do not need the provision; but there are also other objections. It is a curious attempt to harness two horses which may not always wish to run in the same direction. There may be confusion and difficulties; there may be room, not for harmony, but for disharmony, if the two agencies are compelled to agree. There is no provision for which agency's decision should pre vial if they cannot agree. While I am sure that the Secretary of State or Sir Kenneth Berrill and the governor of the Bank of England will always seek to agree, that cannot be guaranteed. Any disagreement would be a recipe for confusion.<br><br>
The Bank of England has already shown its limitations as a supervisory authority. We need recall only the difficulties that it faced in deciding what to do about Johnson Matthey. More important were the difficulties that it encountered in supervising and monitoring activities at Johnson Matthey before the problem was made public. We cannot say, from what we know of the Bank of England's record as a supervisory body, that we have any confidence in injecting it into this area as well. The Minister would have to show what the Bank of England could bring to the supervisory function that is not already provided by the Secretary of State or the SIB. Underlying the doubts and difficulties about the Bank of England as a supervisory authority is a third and more important objection.<br><br>
By its very nature the Bank of England should not be a supervisor here. There is a very good reason which was confirmed to me only yesterday when I discussed the matter with some eminently placed people in the City. The Bank of England is a major client and customer of the City, especially in sales of gilts, the management of the whole gilts market and in financing the Government's borrowing requirements. The Bank is a major player and customer and is in the wrong stance and attitude to be a supervisor at the same time.<br><br>
It was exactly that kind of difficulty that got the Bank into trouble over Johnson Matthey. The Bank was trying to fulfill two roles as a central bank and a lender of last resort to the banking system and as the prudential supervisor of the banking system. Because the Bank of England could not resolve those two separate and distinct responsibilities it got into difficulty. When it was finally faced with the mess it felt obliged as a central bank with a loyalty to the banking system to pick up the pieces at Johnson Matthey whereas an effective regulatory system would have required such incompetence, not to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 713</span>
fraud, to be rewarded or punished by fate. That would have happened if the Bank of England had been simply a supervisor.<br><br>
I fear that that duality of responsibility disqualifies the Bank of England from fulfilling a supervisory role in financial services. The Bank is both client and supervisor and it cannot be expected to fulfil both roles objectively and properly at the same time.<br><br>
When Professor Gower surveyed the possible supervisory agencies in part I of his report he naturally placed most weight on the Department of Trade and Industry as he then envisaged it and on the self-standing commission. He also made a passing glance at the Bank of England as a possible candidate and I was relieved that he did not pursue that line.<br><br>
My reaction was that the Bank of England was simply the wrong institution. Although it falls outside the competence of the Committee, I would go further and say that the distinction between the Bank of England's various roles should disqualify it from a supervisory role in the services covered by the Bill and that disqualification should be carried through into the banking sphere. We should be looking at a separation of the roles of central bank and supervisory authority, as the Americans have, but I concede that that remark goes rather wide of the debate.<br><br>
An objection to removing the Bank of England from its role of jointly appointing, and therefore dismissing, members of the governing body of SIB, is that it is feared that appointments to SIB would become political matters under the control of Ministers. That may or not be the case, but the problem arises with many appointments made by Secretaries of State to public positions. I cannot believe that it is sufficiently strong ground for wiping away the whole structure of appointments which applies across the board in virtually every other industry.<br><br>
It may be argued by the Minister and by other hon. Members that the fear that appointments may become a political football is a fundamental objection to removing from the Bank of England its power to make appointments. If so, we have gone further down the road of political appointments under the Government than many of us feared. The Minister may be better placed than we to understand how far the Government are prepared to use political preference to make such appointments. If the Minister makes that argument he will reveal more than he intends.<br><br>
I hope that no reliance will be placed on that argument and that the Minister will try to deal with the objections to the proposal that I outlined.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that Committee would be unwise to accept the amendment for a range of reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always does.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are good reasons, as I hope the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) will shortly acknowledge.<br><br>
The Secretary of State will benefit very much from the involvement of the governor of the Bank of England in the making of appointments to the designated agency, as the Bill proposes. The governor is of the City; he is at its apex. We aim to create a system of practitioner-based self-regulation and it seems appropriate that the most eminent representative of the City, in the person of the governor of the Bank of England, should have the involvement that the Bill envisages. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties of regulation and supervision that have been touched upon, for example in the case of Johnson Matthey, the overall record shows that the fact that the governor has had a large supervisory role over affairs has been beneficial. People of the quality that we hope will serve on the designated agency would be encouraged if the governor were involved. If they felt that they had the governor's endorsement and that the governor were actively involved, there would be an improved prospect of persuading such people to come forward to serve.<br><br>
If the Committee accepted the amendment and struck out the role of the governor it would be an affront and humiliation to him. It would diminish his authority in the City. That would be a damaging course to take and we should not embark upon it lightly.<br><br>
I wonder whether the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has sought the views of members of the SIB because I should be surprised if they shared his view on that matter. It would be prudent to take account of their thinking. The main reason why I surmise that members of the SIB would not wish to see the governor's role eliminated in the way that the hon. Gentleman proposes is that they would be anxious that there should be a successful, harmonious and practical working relationship between the Bank and the SIB. Above all, we do not want rivalry between the Bank and the designated agency. The provision in the Bill is a wise one to anticipate that sort of difficulty and to minimise the likelihood of there being damaging institutional rivalry.<br><br>
Some of the points made by the hon. Member for Dagenham seemed usually weak arguments. He argued that the fact there can be no absolutely clear demarcation between banking supervision and the supervision of other financial services and investments was a case for keeping separate the role of the Bank of England and the role of the designated agency. If there is to be duality of supervision and an inevitable interpenetration between the various spheres of financial services activity, it would be better to recognise that and to have the structure that the Bill proposes to reduce the scope for disharmony.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But if that were correct and we were to proceed on that basis, surely we should be looking—perhaps not in this Bill but in another—to enable the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and—or Sir Kenneth Berrill to have a say in the appointment of the governor of the Bank of England. Is that what the hon. Gentleman wishes to argue?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 715</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The established pre-eminence of the Bank of England, the history of the institution and the structure of the City make it appropriate to accept that the governor has a special authority and a special contribution to make in this area. The SIB is a new creation which has yet to establish its record and it would be utterly premature to contemplate a proposal that the head of the Securities and Investments Board should have a say in the appointment of the governor of the Bank of England, though who is to say what would be appropriate in years to come? What the hon. Gentleman suggests is at the very least premature.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also argued that the Bank is a major participant in investment markets, so it should not be umpire in a game in which it is a player. However, the Government are also a player. They are a major determining influence on the financial markets through their financial policy. The same argument would apply to the Government and to the Secretary of State representing the Government, so that is a weak point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham pointed out that if the role of the governor were removed, the way would be opened to appointments to the designated agency becoming politicised. Although there is no immediate danger of such a development against the background of the wise policies of the Government, it is as well to build a check into legislation that we have all said we hope will endure. The participation of an independent institution such as the Bank of England would be an ultimate check against the hypothetical eventuality of a future Government seeking to make politically based appointments, and should be strengthened. Therefore, for many reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) carefully, and I do not think that his arguments hold much water.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on what is for me an issue of principle. I hope that he will press the amendment to a vote if the Minister does not give us some comfort in the matter. I agree with the hon. Gentleman for the reasons he expressed and for one other more profound and weighty reason.<br><br>
It is possible that a clear conflict of interest could arise between the Bank's interest in this area and its role in the appointment of supervisors. That applies in the Bank's function as customer too.<br><br>
I was intrigued by the argument of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon that the Government were a customer too. The difference between the Government and the governor of the Bank of England is that the Government are responsible and accountable to the public through the House of Commons, which the governor of the Bank of England is not.<br><br>
It is a matter of constitutional importance to allow the governor of the Bank of England participation in, indeed a veto on—that is what it amounts to—the appointment of the chairman of the SIB. I would think that even if the governor of the Bank of England
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
commanded more general respect than at present, following problems such as Johnson Matthey that have given us so much concern.<br><br>
It is vital for the Secretary of State to take on himself alone the responsibilty of appointing the chairman of the designated authority. There is no reason for him to share that responsibility and dilute that accountability. If the Bill is to mean anything, the Secretary of State must have some direct accountability to the House of Commons. After he has delegated his various powers under the Bill—I do not object to that if they have a reasonable framework—he is probably left with little except the appointment of the chairman of the SIB.<br><br>
I cannot see why the Secretary of State wishes to draw in the governor of the Bank of England, to dilute his own authority and to present the possibility of a veto. I use that word again, because it was challenged on Second Reading when I made exactly the same point. The Secretary of State said that it was not a veto, so I asked him what would happen if the governor of the Bank of England did not agree with an appointment by the Secretary of State. Under the Schedule such a person could not be appointed. What is that but a clear veto? Why should the governor of the Bank of England, who has a clear conflict of interest, be allowed a veto for such an appointment? Why does the Secretary of State wish to dilute his accountability?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said that the Secretary of State would benefit very much from the involvement of the Bank of England. I do not dissent from that. There is no reason why the Secretary of State of the day should not discuss the matter—a wise Secretary of State would do just that. A wise Secretary of State would not wish to appoint somebody with whom the governor of the Bank of England would not be able to work. That sort of consultation is natural, normal, and commendable, but it does not have to be instituted in the Bill as a veto in the hands of the governor of the Bank of England.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said that the governor of the Bank of England should have that unique power because he is of the City. That is precisely why he should not be in the schedule. The appointment of the chairman of the SIB is a matter for the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament alone. If we bring in somebody who is of the very fraternity that we are trying to control—through self-regulation, I grant, once the institutions are in place—we shall dilute that control in a way that is unnecessary and could even be dangerous.<br><br>
I take issue with the comment by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon that it is all part of self-regulation. Self-regulation will take place once the bodies have been instituted—not before. I do not see why it is a part of self-regulation or, if it is a part, why it is essential.<br><br>
We must ask ourselves why the Government want a curious power of veto in the hands of the governor of the Bank of England. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon made a revealing comment. As the hon. Member for Dagenham suggested, the heart of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 717</span>
matter may be that the Government do not want it to become a political appointment. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said that that would be unlikely to happen under the present Government. We may assume that that is the case, because the Government share in all practical senses an identity of interests with the City institutions that the governor of the Bank of England represents. The intention is not to prevent a political appointment under the present Government.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon revealingly went on to suggest that the true nature of the schedule, and the Government's real intent, is to bind the hands of a future Government, whose interests may not be the same as those of the City. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the imprimatur of the present Government runs after they have ceased to be the elected Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. If a future Government were determined to change the rules, they could do so in an Act of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed they could. I assume that that important statement is the product of the hon. Gentleman's long training as a lawyer. It does not merit much of a reply. A Government could do that in all cases—we could replace the whole Bill with anything that we liked. That is not the point.<br><br>
The purpose of the provision has been revealed, as the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said, as something lying there to limit the power of Governments in the future and to protect the interests of the City.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it could work the other way round for the Conservative party? A future governor of the Bank of England, appointed by a Labour Government, may be unsympathetic to the Conservative party's objectives, so the measure may work in both directions.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course it could, but we may be safe for a number of years; at least the measure will carry over for some time.<br><br>
If that is not the intention, the Minister must explain why he is not happy to continue with the normal Government practice of consulting such people as the governor of the Bank of England? That would be proper. Why must he build this into the Bill? Why it is part of the statutory regulation? Why does he wish to hand a veto to the governor of the Bank of England on that important appointment? Why is he not prepared to be wholly accountable to the House of Commons and to the parliamentary system for that important appointment? What is his reason, other than tying a future Government's hands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A word should be said in support of the Bank of England. It has provided an important means of supervision and control over some of the worst
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 718</span>
activities that otherwise might have arisen. Successive governors have discharged their difficult responsibilities in respect of the Bank with exemplary independence.<br><br>
The present governor of the Bank of England is a most outstanding man. If he could play the role envisaged, he would do so in an outstanding and exemplary way. I have no fears about his personality and I pay great respect to the work done by the Bank.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, South and Shoreditch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the governor on the Lamberhurst golf course at the moment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Sedgemore) will contain himself, he will find that he has good reason to do so.<br><br>
I also pay respect to the success of the committee set up by the governor of the Bank of England, in conjunction with the previous Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to consider the preferable way of designing a framework for investor protection and market regulation. That committee worked well, if somewhat secretly, and genuinely attempted, as few other bodies could have done, to come up with a workable framework of investor protection.<br><br>
There is much that is good about the governor, successive governors' abilities and independence, and the Bank of England's track record. But I support the amendment because, over the years, there has been increasing anxiety among the public and on both sides of the House about the governor's increasing involvement—encroachment is perhaps a pejorative term—in the investment markets generally, especially as those markets have grown quantitatively and qualitatively and changed in novel ways.<br><br>
There is anxiety that inclusion of the govenor in the schedule acts, as the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) said, as an effective veto. There is nothing to prevent consultation beforehand. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) said that, the Secretary of State would benefit from the governor's advice, but, if the amendment were accepted, there would be nothing to stop the Secretary of State consulting the governor beore he made such an appointment.<br><br>
The primary role of the Bank of England should be what it was historically—that of fiduciary and prudential control. I have said on the Floor of the House that there is a fundamental difference between the administration and judgments involved in the banking system and fiduciary and prudential control, and those in the investment industry. For example, reserve asset ratios in the banking system, the criteria that one should apply to prudential control of that system, and those that one uses to make judgments about the debts that financial companies can incur, are different from the criteria that attach to decisions about risk equity investments and about the personalities involved in them.<br><br>
Why, for example, does an ability to raise eyebrows and invite the board of directors of a merchant bank to tea, thus showing an interest in the banking system,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 719</span>
automatically make someone well qualified in the marketing of investment and insurance businesses by myriad people countrywide? It does not follow; the industries are different and the Committee should question whether we should leave untrammelled the right of the governor to become increasingly involved in these new investment industries.<br><br>
The governor's involvement historically has been self-assumed here, partly because in a vacuum created by the lack of anyone else to supervise, the governor was best able to do so. But that is no longer the case, because we now have a statutorily recognised SIB.<br><br>
Furthermore, I believe that the provision will have consequences for the staffing of the Bank of England. Although the schedule refers to the governor, no one sincerely believes that the governor, as an individual, will consult the Secretary of State and draw up a list of potential appointees of SIB. Some unit within the Bank will have to monitor the progress of SIB, and that, in turn, will give rise to questions of conflict of interest and duality of bureaucracy. Also, the actual appointment of the chairman of SIB will be less the joint appointment of the Secretary of State and the governor of the Bank of England, than an appointment of the governor made with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State for Trade and? Industry. That may be well and good, but we must consider the consequences of such an arrangement.<br><br>
The real argument is a political one. These paragraphs were inserted in the schedule to ensure that a future Government, of a quite different political complexion, do not appoint a chairman of SIB who will inflict certain rules on the City without taking notice of the working requirements of the City and the institutions, which the governor might be expected to protect.<br><br>
However, although the governor of the Bank of England enjoys a high degree of independence, he is, in the last resort, an appointee of the Government, and if the Government wish, they can get rid of him. Following criticism of previous incumbents, changes have been made, sometimes before the end of the due period of service.<br><br>
If the Government seriously want to influence or change the powers being exercised under the clause by SIB, a range of other options is open. Under clause 96 the Government have the right to transfer only part of the Secretary of State's powers, and under clause 97 they have the right to call back certain powers and the right to revoke the whole SIB. Therefore, there is no great political argument for having, for all time, a decision jointly made by the Secretary of State and the governor of the Bank of England.<br><br>
Anyway, in framing good legislation we have to trust in the democracy of this country and not try to fix legislation in such a way as to ensure that on a change of Government one sectional interest continues to prevail over appointments.<br><br>
Although the Bank of England's record is exemplary in many ways, it is not entirely without fault in its supervision of banking or investment industries or in the appointments that it has made. The Johnson Matthey Bank situation has been much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
publicised and commented upon recently, but a better example might be the outrageous dawn raid activities and the building up of covert shareholdings in Consolidated Gold Fields. That was an instance that gave rise to the Companies Act 1981. My interpretation of the results of the subsequent inquiry is that there was clear criticism of the role of the Bank of England, or its lack of incisiveness and the extent to which it delayed taking action to stop activities that were wholly prejudicial to minority shareholders who were not on the inside in those dealings. In that area, of which the example I have given is a specific instance, the governor and the Bank for which he is responsible have not always acquitted themselves with the efficiency, speed and sensitivity to the investor and public opinion that qualifies them to have a joint decision-making role in the SIB.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Council for the Securities Industry is already in existence and up to now has had an unmandatory remit. Nevertheless it is an appointed remit to supervise the activities of some investment markets, the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel. The appointment of the chairman of the Council for the Securities Industry has been made in the past by none other than the governor of the Bank of England. Can anyone say that the Council for the Securities Industry has been so successful, so incisive and so sensitive to investor protection that it has acquitted its role in a high profile and successful way? No one can, least of all my hon. and learned Friend who is bringing forward the Bill for the very reason that past procedures of control have failed.<br><br>
I make no personal comment about the past chairman of the Council for the Securities Industry because his hands were tied in what he could do and the influence that he could exert, but it provides a precedent in the appointment by the governor of the Bank of England of someone to oversee these industries.<br><br>
My final argument is the simple political one that the public are watching the Committee to see whether we are sensitive to what I perceive as their interest—to improve investor protection and to set up procedures, appointments and rules that clearly will provide them with greater investor protection than in the past. If we are to give the public the impression that we are doing that when really all we are doing is giving a little statutory gloss to what remains largely a self-regulatory system, we shall not only be failing in our duty, but it will be a gross breach of trust with those who have much higher expectations from the Bill than can be achieved, even after the passage of our amendment last week.<br><br>
So, for all those reasons, I am inclined to support the amendment. My hon. and learned Friend will know that I am not a lone voice on the Conservative Benches. In successive debates on the Floor of the House at least half a dozen of my hon. Friends have intervened during the Secretary of State's speech or have said in their own speeches that they treat with some suspicion the encroachment of the governor of the Bank of England. We do not do that in an absolute way, but we question whether that right should be built into law in the way that the Bill envisages.</span></p>

<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, which I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham will push to a vote. It is a crucial amendment and provides that the SIB can be butted up the backside by a unicorn but not by a hydra—or whatever the two-headed beast was called. Classical allusions fail me in this context.<br><br>
I regard the amendment as part of the tidying up process necessitated by the Beaconsfield-Chichester amendment which was accepted last week and it would put the whole structure on a statutory basis.<br><br>
I must contradict the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), who talked about a designated agency. We should have changed the title of the schedule to "Qualifications of Statutory Agency" as part of the tidying up process.<br><br>
The process has produced an extraordinary change in the Committee's functioning. From its beginning it has been conducted like a tutorial addressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham. He has held the Committee spellbound and slowly educated hon. Members, especially the Minister, in the procedures of the City. Now the nature of the tutorial has changed. I have worked in education and I recognise the expression on the Minister's face. It is that of a recalcitrant ESN pupil who does not believe what has been said, cannot answer it and, in his sulky fashion, is determined to kick the furniture as soon as leaves the tutorial. Perhaps it is a case of, "When the Whip's away the mice will play." But no, I see that there has been a replacement Whip in a different, slimmer embodiment. No point escapes my gaze!<br><br>
There has been a change in the nature of the Committee. The Minister wore an expression of bafflement while the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) put the Government's case rather badly for the old-fashioned mark I Bill before it was turned by the Beaconsfield-Chichester amendment into the mark II, snazzy, workable, sensible Bill. The Government's argument was put by the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon and sense was talked by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). We shall support the case for sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sedgemore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that everyone in the City is referring to Nelson's Bill, perhaps it would be better if the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) went to the Front Bench and changed places with the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Lamond, that from your experience of thousands of Committees you will recognise that there has been a total change. Normally Conservative Members sit silently on the Back Benches—the huddles masses yearning to be free of the whole bloody thing. I apologise, Mr. Lamond, and withdraw that expression. Conservative Members are normally yearning to free of the business and say nothing. Now there is sharp division between the Governments view and the sensible view, with the Minister sitting silent. It is a total reversal of roles in Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
There are two points to be made. First contrary to what the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said, the governor is essentially a political appointee especially under this Government, who made a political appointment par excellence. I do not quibble with that, but the Bank of England, which many of us thought was nationalised in 1945, is not the voice of the Government in the City, controlling and managing the City for the national purposes determined by the Government.<br><br>
It has become the voice of the City in Government, which is a total reversal of its expected role. I do not want that power of the Bank extended here. It is a field where there should be on authority—the Secretary of State—and not the governor acting as the voice of the City as he normally does in such functions.<br><br>
Secondly, the amendment recognises the nature of a deregulated, highly competitive and dynamic City. There is not only the big bang at the stock exchange but a new atmosphere, in which the old-boy, "you scratch my back I'll scratch your's" network of personalised contact and of management by good, sound chaps is going. We are seeing a much more competitive, dynamic system based on conflict and it is important to recognise that in the regulatory nature of the institution.<br><br>
The SIB should have a competitive, strong, independent centre of power, and its functions should be kept independent of those of the Bank of England. However, the Minister tries, he will not be able to stitch back the old network of personalised contacts and personalised man management by chaps who knew each other because they all went to the same school, shared the same background, joined the same clubs and thought the same thoughts—if they can be dignified with the word "thoughts".—All the kings horses, and all the king's men aint going to put that together again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, following the remarks of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), if the Bill is to be regarded as Nelson's Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) will make sure that he looks through his telescope with his good eye if he looks out to sea. We are in danger on this amendment and in other matters of getting trapped into a vacuum of argument that has little bearing on improvement in relation to the City.<br><br>
The Bill is a good Bill and will do a great deal to help the City to face up to the problems of international competition on a proper self-regulating basis. However, some of the more extravagant statements that have emerged during the past few days—primarily from Opposition Members—mean that the good value of the Bill could easily be diminished, and the good working relationship established on the Committee may be seriously undermined.<br><br>
If we were to remove the governor of the Bank of England from the provision, the appointment would be a purely political decision, which is what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby seemed to be homing in on as his main objection. Therefore, contrary to what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 723</span>
the hon. Gentleman says, the fact that the governor of the Bank of England is included in the decision is the best safeguard that it will not be a purely political appointment. It is not necessary to add much more to that.<br><br>
We are in danger of failing to see the wood for the trees on the value of the Bill. However, I understand that Opposition Members are anxious to make as much political capital as possible about what I believe will turn out to be a fairly unimportant amendment. Amendment by amendment will begin to reverse the process which at present the Opposition Members seem to have rearded as creating a crest of a wave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it extraordinary that this argument about the role of the governor of the Bank of England is being introduced. I cannot understand Opposition Members' arguments.<br><br>
If there is a defect in the Bill, it is that too much discretion is automatically given to the Secretary of State. In a later series of amendments, I have sought to introduce some limitation by at least requiring him to undertake further consultation when making changes. It is strange that the governor of the Bank of England should be thought of as representing the private interests of the City when he is the governor of a nationalised institution representing the public interest and appointed by the Government of the day. The fact that he may reflect to some degree and on some occasions the political views of the Government who appointed him—though I hope that that is not the case—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that that is the case at the moment. The Labour party, being a deferential institution, normally appoints the financially orthodox who are put forward by financially orthodox opinion, because we are such creeps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that intervention regrettable because it casts a totally unjustified aspersion on the present holder of the office.<br><br>
Some may consider that the governor has a political viewpoint, but that does not invalidate the need for a balance of views. The governor of the Bank of England may, in the future, be appointed by a Labour Government—or, I suppose, even an alliance Government. The requirement for consensus on the appointment of members of the governing body is a good thing and should be commended.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) said that previous governors and the Bank of England have been fallible. That is irrelevant. Of course they have been fallible. It would be remarkable if we were able to appoint a governor or set up an institution that was infallible.<br><br>
The Secretary of State should be advised by someone who understands the views of those operating in the market but who is a Government appointee. Therefore, I shall not support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for supporting the Government on the amendment, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Bour-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
nemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). He stressed the importance of the governor's role in securing the respect of the City for the system to be instituted by the Bill. The provisions of the schedule are designed to achieve two objectives: effective parliamentary accountability and the respect and confidence of the financial services community.<br><br>
The Secretary of State must ensure parliamentary accountability. He should not answer for the day-to-day activities of the agency. But the agency will be exercising powers conferred by Parliament. Ministers should be answerable to Parliament for the overall effectiveness of the regulatory system and for the appointment and removal of those exercising statutory powers.<br><br>
However, it is important that the agency commands the respect of those it regulates. If it did not command that respect, it would not have the authority to maintain the standards that we all want. It is easy to see the agency's role as being essentially that of enforcing its rules. That will be important, but it will be more important for the agency to promote an atmosphere in which the rules are complied with as a matter of course. Evidence shows that that task will be easier if the agency commands respect from the financial services community. Therefore, the governor of the Bank of England should play a part in the appointments procedure. His presence will reassure the business community that those appointed to run the agency will include people who understand the proper concerns of that community and who will ensure that regulation does not unnecessary impede the development of efficient and competitive United Kingdom markets.<br><br>
I am not convinced that there would be the same confidence if appointments were made solely by a Minister. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is intriguing that the provision is considered necessary so that any political bias shown by a Secretary of State when appointing a chairman of the SIB could be offset by Mr. Robin Leigh-Pemberton riding to the rescue to ensure that no scintilla of political motivation entered into such public appointments.<br><br>
However, I do not believe that that is what the Minister and other members of the Committee wanted to argue. It smacks too much of that traditional Conservative position which can be summed up as: "What we do is not politics. Only the wicked Labour Party ever introduces politics into these matters." That is an attitude with which many of us are unfortunately familiar.<br><br>
It would be a mistake to approach the matter on the basis that it is a competition between parties hoping to be in government one day to see how long they can promote their own influence in the matter of public appointments. I hope that the Committee will consider that the matter should be resolved in favour of the best and most workable system.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) accused me of unusual thinness in my arguments when I moved amendment No. 43. I would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
normally take such criticism to heart but in this case my worries have been reduced by the powerful arguments—which reinforced my own—of my hon. Friends, of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and especially of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). Anyone who considered the debate objectively would say that any thinness in my initial presentation was more than made up by the force of those arguments. Indeed, I am content to rest on those arguments as they encapsulate what we are trying to achieve.<br><br>
No one is suggesting that the governor of the Bank of England should be excluded in every way from these matters. I agree with the hon. Member for Chichester about the desirability of consultation. That may come about whatever is included in the Bill. What we are discussing is whether the governor should have a veto. We have reached such an unsatisfactory position because there was a clash between the Secretary of State and the Bank of England when these matters were first debated about who should have the prevailing power. Consultation was the best stand-off that could be arrived at. We should not legislate on such an unsatisfactory basis.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chichester made a point, which was also reflected in the Minister's speech. We may propose that the governor of the Bank of England should have a say in the decision, and commend his expertise because he is in touch with the City. The Bank of England knows people in the City. However, once it is admitted to this role, it will be equipped to say, "We know these people best. What do politicians and civil servants know of these matters?" No matter how it is dressed up in the provisions of schedule 5, it will result in decisions being made formally by the Secretary of State in conjunction with the governor of the Bank of England, but in effect, on the substantive advice given by officials at the Bank of England. We all know that that will happen. I am not satisfied with that, for the reasons that I attempted to explain, and which were supported by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Chichester. I shall not rehearse those arguments again, but as it is an important matter I shall press it to a vote.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 140, line 24, at end, insert "in equal numbers".</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>(ii) all members must be appointed and must signify their willingness to serve, on a regular, rather than part-time, basis.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 244, in page 140, line 30, at end, insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(4) The Chairman of the governing body must be appointed from among the persons specified in subparagraph (3)(6) above.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My amendments Nos 242 to 244 are linked and the amendment of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has a similar intention. All are designed to give a clearer definition and a wider spread of membership, and to define the balance of membership on the statutory agency that will run the industry.<br><br>
The problem with the present definition is that it says nothing about the balance of membership—the relation between the numbers of members reperesent-ing the industry and those representing the users of industry. The definition in paragraph 1(3)(b):
<br><blockquote><p>"regular users on their own account or on behalf of others"</p></blockquote>
is inadequate. The clause is too vague. The legislation should require parity for representatives of industry and independent members, with the latter including not only those representing the public interest, broadly defined but those representing the users. The legislation should also provide an independent chairman to control the statutory agency. That is the intention and, the amendments speak for themselves.<br><br>
The key amendment is No. 243 which changes the unsatisfactory definition so that it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"persons able to represent the public interest having no connection with the interests of persons carrying on investment business and persons able to represent the interests of users".</p></blockquote>
The two groups which will be included under subparagraph <i>(3)(b)</i> must have equality of membership with the group in subparagraph (3)(a). The chairman of the governing body—the statutory agency as we have now made it and as I am sure that it will remain when the Bill returns to the House and the Minister has thrown his tantrum on Report—must be appointed from among those specified in subparagraph (3)(6) with my wider definition of those representing both the public interest and the users.<br><br>
We must define the membership and the independent section in those ways, and we must have some assurance that the public interest will be maintained. The statutory agency must not become a mutually congratulating interest group drawn from one field. My definition provides for that more satisfactorily than does the definition in the schedule.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendments is similar to that of the amendments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). As he said, we should introduce an independent element that can represent and cope with the public interest.<br><br>
My amendments, in establishing a different proportion go a little further than those of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. However, the question of what the proportion should be is not of great importance to me. There may be an advantage in not having a majority of independents on the board. In that sense, I prefer the hon. Gentleman's amendment to mine.<br><br>
When I drafted the amendment, I thought it important to have a majority of independent representatives, who will be able to look to the public interest, but, on further consideration, I realise that, if there were too many of them, it might put too much power in the hands of the executive and bureaucracy of the SIB, as the independent representatives would lack experience in the early days. However, the proportion of representatives is a matter of detail rather than principle.<br><br>
The question of having on the SIB independents capable of looking after the public interest involves principles. It is important that that should be nominated in the Bill. If the Minister does not give us undertakings along that line, I hope that the matter will be pushed to the vote.<br><br>
Amendment No. 261 introduces the idea that representatives on the board should be full-time, or, at least, that a place on the board should not be seen as just part-time casual employment, which is possible under the Bill. It would be all too easy for the Government to put on the board people who come from the list of the great and the good, but who can only give inadequate time to the SIB.<br><br>
Sir Martin Jacomb, who is much involved with Barclays bank, has been appointed a deputy chairman. One wonders how much time he will be able to give to the SIB. The same may be said of Mark Weinberg of Abbey Life Assurance. I am not casting any aspersions on their abilities or probity, but they are busy men, so one wonders how they will be able to find enough time to do their jobs on the SIB in the way that will be necessary, certainly in the early days and, if the organisation is to be as powerful as I hope it is, in the days to follow as well.<br><br>
Figures such as £8,000 a year for members of the SIB and £12,000 a year for the deputy chairman have been bandied about in the press recently. Will the Minister confirm them? How much time will £8,000 a year buy from people such as Sir Martin Jacomb and Mark Weinberg?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The SIB would get Members of Parliament for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, but would it get City lawyers and practitioners? The average corporate lawyer in the City earns £176,000 a year. If we are to pay these people £8,000 a year—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister is going to deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to see. If we are to pay these people £8,000 a year, I have calculated that we shall be able to buy a whole 10 hours of their work in any given year. For all we know, some hon. Gentlemen may be sacrificing just that sum to be here this morning.<br><br>
It is a serious point. The people with responsibility will have an important and time-consuming job to do, and we should not allow them to think that their jobs are part-time. That is why my amendment suggests that they must signify their willingness to serve on a regular rather than a part-time basis.<br><br>
Will the Minister give us an idea of the salaries that will be paid for such important jobs and if, in his view those salaries will be as low as £8,000?<br><br>
In Sir Kenneth Berrill's important speech to <i>The Financial Times</i> conference on 21 January 1986, he touched on the matter. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill as it stands does not rule out the inclusion of a number of 'independents'—that is, persons who are neither users of the markets nor practitioners—and I for my part would welcome some appointments of this sort."</p></blockquote>
Sir Kenneth Berrill would actually welcome the appointment of independents along the lines that the hon. member for Great Grimsby and I suggested. He added:
<br><blockquote><p>"Neither would I rule out the appointment of more full-time board members-I am at present the only one—if that proved administratively desirable: it may well do so when our disciplinary system starts to operate."</p></blockquote>
That is the point that I wish to make in support of the amendment. I hope that the Minister will tell us his views on the matter.<br><br>
One strand running through our debate on which most Committee members are agreed is the desirability of getting people of the appropriate quality on to the self-regulating organisations and the designated agency. I believe that that can be achieved by the protection and representation of the public interest and also by the provision of regular rather than part-time jobs. I hope that the Minister will at least accept the spirit of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a similar debate when we were discussing paragraph 5 of schedule 2 in relation to the SROs. We need an element of independence in such bodies and I have considerable sympathy with the general objectives put forward by the hon. Members for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). However, I think that they are going over the top in the way that they seek to ensure that the public interest should be represented.<br><br>
People with no direct connection with the investment businesses in question, who are known as the wise and the good, and who command respect should be allowed to serve on such a body. Even if they were in the minority they would be able to say, "Hey, wait a minute. I think perhaps we ought to have another think about this."<br><br>
Schedule 5 does not necessarily preclude people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0327">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
with that independence. I seek the Ministers assurance on that point. Paragraph 5 of schedule 2 expressly states with regard to SROs that there should be a balance:
<br><blockquote><p>"between the interests of the different members of the organisation"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"between the interests of the organisation or its members and the interests of the public."</p></blockquote>
I would argue strongly tht the element of self-regulation that is required there, and which underpins the Bill, should lead us to a general view that that independence should be included in the Bill—if not now, later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I concur with the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). The Bill is probably all right as it stands, and although I understand the reasons for the amendments, I am not inclined to support either of them.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is in my judgment subsumed within paragraph l(3)(/>) which states that members of the governing body must include "other persons including" the two categories that it goes on to mention. The two categories are not exclusive: the "other persons" can mean nothing other than people who are not either regular users of the service or carrying on an investment business, nevertheless, the hon. Member for Great Grimsby and the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) do the Committee a service in discussing it.<br><br>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Yeovil is self-destructive and he recognised its inadequacy—at least in the early stages of the SIB. With reference to his argument, I too spoke on the composition of the SROs and I made two points: first, they should have lay membership—and when I say lay,.I mean lay; and secondly, there may be a case for varying proportions of lay membership on different SROs. It is probably worthwhile to have a larger proportion of lay members on the SIB than on the SROs because, as I said when we discussed SROs, in order to be self-regulating they have to be authoritative and knowledgeable about the markets they control on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>
It is wholly reasonable and desirable that a clear majority of the members of the SROs should be practitioners and I do not like the part of the amendment that states, as I understand it, that practitioners must comprise less than half of the SIB. However, I recognise the case—I would argue it—for substantial lay representation on the SIB.<br><br>
Therefore, I support the Bill as it stands in that respect, but will my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary clarify what he understands by "other persons" as he did most helpfully when we discussed SROs? Can he emphasise the case for having throughly lay members and not members who have been, or are, tangentially involved with the operation of markets? It is an important matter that was raised as long ago as the excellent Wilson Committee report on City institutions which threw light, in a very unwelcome way, on the total lack of lay membership of the organisations that regulate the activities of the City.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
Since then, opinion has moved a great deal and many of the organisations have introduced some lay members. Those of us who have made that point to the chairmen of the Council for the Securities Industry or the council of the stock exchange have found them more receptive recently than hitherto.<br><br>
I hope I may catch the attention of my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary. In the future, people will refer to his remarks in Standing Committee to understand what he meant by "other persons" and lay members. I hope that he will emphasise that if they are to be included on the board they must be thoroughly lay, and not tangentially associated with the markets that they are charged to supervise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the objectives of the hon. Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) in tabling the amendments which seek to ensure the presence on the designated agency of persons able to represent the interests of users and of persons able to represent the public interest.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) I should like to hear about what such phrases mean and how it is proposed to find suitable representatives. While the objectives are desirable, there are genuine difficulties, particularly if amendment No. 242 is accepted. It would require the representatives with wider interests to serve on the designated agency in numbers equal to the professional representatives. Finding people to serve in such a capacity will prove a practical puzzle and I should like to know how hon. Gentlemen and my hon. and learned Friend the Minister envisage the system working.<br><br>
I also dispute the point put by the hon. Member for Yeovil in amendment No. 261, which seeks to require that all members serve
<br><blockquote><p>"on a regular, rather than a part-time, basis."</p></blockquote>
As I have said before, I think that would be a mistake because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman goes too far with that argument, will he consider the phrasing of subparagraph (ii) of amendment No. 261, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"all members…. must signify their willingness to serve"?</p></blockquote>
It does not say that they have to serve, but that they should be willing, if required under certain circumstances in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even so, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take account of my argument. If we are to find first-class people with up-to-date experience, it will be difficult to persuade them, in any circumstances, to serve full time. We are looking for people who command respect in the City because of their intimate knowledge of the working of the City and their current standing, and it would be difficult to persuade them to abandon their present occupations and commit themselves to serve—in any circumstances—as full-time members of the agency.<br><br>
I fear that if the full rigour of the amendment were to be exercised, the agency would be manned either by secondees or by retired people. It is asking too much of firms to second their best people, so they will second
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
the people whom they can more easily do without and they may not be the very best. Retired people may be of great eminence and ability, but in the rapidly changing world of financial services their experience will all too quickly become out of date, and they, too, will be unable to meet the need.<br><br>
I think therefore that it would be a mistake to ask members to serve full time, or even to be willing to serve full time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the wording of amendment No. 261, which does not use the words "full-time" but says
<br><blockquote><p>"a regular, rather than part-time, basis".</p></blockquote>
I concede that it is difficult to phrase an amendment carrying the full sense of what I seek.<br><br>
The amendment was tabled to probe the Minister's mind, to see whether he views the appointments as full or part time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) says, because there is ambiguity in the drafting of amendment No. 261, which says
<br><blockquote><p>"all members must be appointed…<i>on a regular, rather than a part-time, basis."</i></p></blockquote>
He then qualifies his requirement. However, I accept that this is a probing amendment.<br><br>
Finally, in advocating provision for agency members to serve on a part-time basis, I do not mean to depreciate their responsibilities. It will be essential that they should be serviced by a highly capable full-time staff.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful to say that Opposition Members support the general thrust of the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), and many of the intentions of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). That view is common to many Committee members. The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was right when he said that subparagraph <i>(3)(b)</i> would allow flexibility in those matters, and I am sure that the Minister will confirm that.<br><br>
However, Opposition Members are anxious that subparagraph (3)(b) fails to tell us precisely what we need to know about two matters. First, we need to know the proportions of those who should comprise the governing body—how many should be representatives of the financial services industry, and how many should be "other persons". Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby is especially anxious to know whether a distinction will be made among those "other persons", between those identified in subparagraph <i>(3)(b)</i> as "users"—who may, therefore, fall foul of the strictures of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) about those already in a close relationship with others carrying out investment business—and those who will be representatives of the public interest and, therefore, in every sense, independent and lay. The Minister must give us some assurances on those two points.<br><br>
It would be unfortunate if the Committee were com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
pelled to divide on the matter, when most Committee members are of the same mind. We may avoid that outcome, if the Minister provides a little more detail about his intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that our discussion on the amendments relates to a common objective. I listened to hon. Members' speeches and there was clearly a widespread view that members other than those taking part in investment business, who are working members of the markets to be regulated, should be represented on the board of the designated agency. The question is, therefore, how that objective can best be achieved, and, on this occasion, I am happy to rely largely on the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) in support of the Bill. He said that the provisions of subparagraph (3)(b) aimed to ensure that some board members did not work in the markets to be regulated.<br><br>
Difficulties arise when one seeks to go beyond the formula in subparagraph (3)(b), and endeavours to be more specific, as, for instance, the hon. Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) have sought in their amendments. Such attempts would restrict the designated agency to an undesirable extent in the membership of the board, and inevitably give rise to problems of definition, which are best avoided.<br><br>
I can most conveniently illustrate those difficulties in responding to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He asked whether I could tell the Committee the extent to which those identified in subparagraph (3)(fr) of paragraph 1 would be "wholly independent" by which he meant those who were not
<br><blockquote><p>"users on their own account or on behalf of others of services provided by persons carrying on investment business of any such kind."</p></blockquote>
A moment's reflection shows the difficulty of that concept. A user of investment business of the kind carried out is anyone who has a share, a holding of unit trusts or a life assurance policy, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman intended there to be representatives on the board who were not professional users of the services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that on this occasion the Minister is doing less than justice to his own drafting as the provision refers to "regular users", a concept which I would have thought was readily comprehensible to hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be readily comprehensible but it is not necessarily free from difficulty. Some people who regularly buy and sell shares may not be professionals and may earn their living by some other activity. There are considerable difficulties with definition in seeking to tie the board down as the amendments require.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. and learned Friend the Minister to the fact that under paragraph 1 no specific number of persons is prescribed as a proper number for the agency. Subparagraph (3) merely states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The members of the governing body must include"</p></blockquote>
those stated. I emphasise the word "include"—it is an open number. Of course subparagraphs (3)(a) and (b)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0329">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
must be complied with. Subparagraph (3)(b) provides a degree of flexibility which is what I seek. I think that the hon. Gentleman overlooked my point with regard to schedule 2 as, in the case of the SROs, it clearly imports the notion of public interest. That was at the root of what I was getting at when I argued for an assurance that some independent persons would be included in the constitution of the designated agency.<br><br>
The Minister should be a little more explicit. There is flexibility as regards numbers by virtue of the use of the word "include".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point with which I was about to deal. I have made the point that tying the agency down would pose undesirable problems and lead to difficulties. However, I can give my hon. Friends the assurance he seeks. I would certainly expect the governing body to include members who were independent—in the sense that the word is being used and understood in the Committee—both of those who carried on investment business in the markets being regulated and of those who are regular or professional users of those services. I would expect such members to be appointed to the board.<br><br>
I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) who asked how members were to be found. The Committee's decision on amendment No. 43 would ensure the role of the governor in appointing members of the board.<br><br>
The amendments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby would create a definitional problem. One would have to consider, for instance, whether a retired practitioner was considered to be a practitioner or a non-practitioner. Such questions are unnecessary if we retain the formula provided in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started off very promisingly and I thought how much he improved when he was not using his notes. Now unfortunately he has turned back to them and his performance is degenerating.<br><br>
There is a problem of definition and I have two questions for the Minister. First, what is wrong with the definition in amendment No. 243, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"persons able to represent the public interest having no connection with the interests of persons carrying on investment business"?</p></blockquote>
What is wrong with a straightforward definition in terms of the public interest?<br><br>
Secondly, the tortuous definition in paragraph 1(3)(6) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"regular users on their own account or on behalf of others of services provided by persons carrying on investment business of any such kind."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister regard that as a satisfactory definition? Surely the definition that I have so kindly provided, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"persons able to represent the interests of users"</p></blockquote>
is preferable to the tortuous, convoluted and incomprehensible definition in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful for the efforts of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby to help us with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
the difficult problems of definition and to point to solutions which may improve the formula in the Bill, but I am afraid that I consider the formula in the Bill to be preferable to that in amendment No. 243. My reason also refers to problems of definition. Amendment No. 243 would insert in the Bill a reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"persons able to represent the public interest having no connection with the interests of persons carrying on investment business".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Significant connection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word "significant" does not appear in amendment No. 243. The hon. Member for Yeovil sees immediately the problem with amendment No. 243 and is ready with a suggestion to complicate it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to help the Minister. I remembered that he liked the word "significant" so I thought that he might use it here. It would have the same kind of meaning here as it did earlier when he put so much stress on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that on this occasion the intervention of the hon. Member for Yeovil is less helpful than he would wish. His suggested amendment to the amendment of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby would mean that the courts or anyone seeking to interpret the provision would have to consider the precise meaning not only of the word "connection", but of the word "significant".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As indeed they will when they interpret the key phrase in which the Minister used the word earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are occasions when such difficult questions are inescapable. I suggest that where they can be avoided they should be avoided. Here they can be avoided perfectly well because the formula in the Bill is more than adequate to achieve objectives which are, to a large extent, common ground on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Yeovil asked whether the chairman or members should be obliged to "signify their willingness" to serve on a full-time basis. The objections to that concept were expressed forcefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon. I understood the response of the hon. Member for Yeovil to be that he did not really mean the words in his amendment. I suggest that similar words would give rise to similar difficulties and I am content to rely on the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that I told his hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) that I wanted to hear the Minister's view and that it would help the Committee if the Minister would say how he saw this job, which will be so important. Moreover, does the Minister feel able to discuss how much salary these people will be paid? If the Minister can give some suggestion it will be a message to us about how seriously he envisages the jobs being taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Yeovil quoted from Sir Kenneth Berrill's speech at the <i>Financial Times</i> conference a few weeks ago. It is more appro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
priate that such matters should be left to Sir Kenneth Berrill than that they should be the subject of ministerial comment. The whole point of the private sector agency, for which provision is made in the Bill, is that it should consider matters such as appropriate fees and the extent to which members of the board should be full-time or part-time.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I am sorry to press the issue but I take strong exception to the Minister's reference to a private agency. That does not exist in the Bill because the Bill has been amended. Will you clarify the position, Mr. Lamond?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister says is a matter for him as long as it is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the hon. Gentleman's point of order? The only effect of the change to clause 96 in the context of the hon. Gentleman's point of order is that the private sector agency, for which provision is made in the Bill, is now identified in the Bill.<br><br>
Other changes may have to be considered, but that is the only change with a bearing on the question whether the agency remains a private sector agency.<br><br>
The extent to which there should be full-time or part-time members and the basis on which they are remunerated are far better left to Sir Kenneth Berrill, whose speech was quoted by the hon. Member for Yeovil, than to be the subject of ministerial comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At some stage the Minister will have to recognise the designated agency. It is important to know the criteria for recognition. I recall that one was that he should consider that the organisation was capable of fulfilling its job.<br><br>
I do not expect the Minister to quote a salary. It is right and proper that that should be left to SIB to decide, but surely he can say that he could not recognise a body that could deploy its members in their jobs for only as little as, say, 10 hours a year on the basis of salaries of £8,000. Will the Minister go so far as to say that such levels of salary would not be commensurate with the tasks that he will delegate to the board?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The extent to which members of the agency would work full-time would be taken into account by the Secretary of State and the governor when they made appointments. On the question of how many should be full-time and part-time, great reliance would be placed on the views of the chairman of the agency and the hon. Member for Yeovil has quoted from those views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we have a little more clarity from the Minister. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) laid it straight on the line. If we hear a satisfactory reply we shall accept it. Without a satisfactory reply we shall be obliged to press the amendment to a Division.<br><br>
We have not yet had a satisfactory reply. The Minis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
ter concentrated on nit-picking pedantry and quibbling, which is the traditional tactic of a lawyer defending a bad case. Why does he not answer two questions? What will be the proporation of lay members on the statutory agency as it now is? Secondly, I gather that there is some dissatisfaction in the industry with the tortuous definition in paragraph l(3)(b) of
<br><blockquote><p>"regular users on their own account or on behalf of others of services provided by persons carrying on investment business of any such kind."</p></blockquote>
Is that definition satisfactory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I do not think that it would be desirable to fix in the Bill or by way of ministerial pronouncement a particular proportion of independent members of the agency. There should be such members and the bill provides for them. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is yes, and I cannot think of a better note on which to end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the exchange between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) showed some of the problems that we discussed earlier. I do not want to go over that ground again, but it illustrates how difficult it is for the Committee to deal satisfactorily with some of the issues.<br><br>
In support of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) may I say that I thought that the Minister laid too much stress on the difficulties of definition involved. I was surprised that he thinks that retired practitioners will cause a problem. Surely they fall quite claerly within paragraph l(3)(a) as "persons with experience".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman would mention paragraph 1(3)(6); that shows how difficult this would be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that paragraph l(3)(a) would cover retired practitioners, and I would be interested to know how they could be excluded.<br><br>
The real question, however, arises on paragraph <i>l(3)(b),</i> and here, I think, the Minister made too much of the problems of identifying what we are trying to achieve. As the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) pointed out, there was no difficulty in introducing an element of public interest under schedule 2, and that is exactly what the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby seeks. I see no drafting problem here.<br><br>
The Minister's reply to the intervention of my hon. Friend on numbers was very disappointing. Unless the governor of the Bank of England is to have an even greater influence than we have detected the Minister, or his Secretary of State, must have some idea before he starts to make the appointments about what proportions of people in the various categories are required. I assume that Ministers are not leaving it all to chance. They must have some policy on the proportions of practitioners, users and indepedent people to be represented on the governing body, for the Minister has conceded that there will be representatives from each of those categories.<br><br>
I can see that there may be overlapping, although
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1985-1986V004P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
independent representatives must necessarily form a watertight category. The Minister cannot get away with a bland statement to the effect that it is impossible to fetter his discretion at this stage. He will have to make up his mind, and all we are looking for is some indication about where his mind is likely to lead him. If he wants to tell us that he has not yet thought about the appointments, that would be honest, if disappointing. If, however, he is saying that he cannot be expected to decide these matters, the Committee must not accept that response and will have to press him.<br><br>
Is the Minister thinking of roughly equal numbers in the categories, or is he saying that the independent or the user members should be in the minority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No difficulty is caused by overlap as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) suggests. But I do not believe that any secretary of State would wish to be tied to particular proportions, or that it would be desirable. Also, the mix may change from time to time, because the most important matters that the Secretary of State and the governor will have to take into account in making appointments is the quality of the people available to serve, the expertise that may be needed at any time, and so on. However, we are still some way away from the time when such details have to be taken into account.<br><br>
It would be wholly premature, and I think unwise, to speculate at this stage on matters such as the proportions. I cannot therefore respond more positively to the hon. Gentleman than I have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. and learned Friend? I am not so interested in the proportions, as I said when speaking on the amendments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. I am more interested in the public interest, and I do not see any reason for going to a point that might exclude that. Although it is not excluded, it could be made more specific. Can my hon. and learned Friend be more explicit when saying that he—wearing the hat of the Secretary of State in the future—will take the public interest element into account in relation to any appointment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had dealt with that point and had made it clear that in all probability the Secretary of State would want to appoint members who were not regular users or professionals and were therefore independent and representative of the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that the Minister has satisfied the Committee on either of the points that have emerged—the public interest point or the proportionality point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
My hon. Friends and I are understanding and forgiving people. Notwithstanding the terms of the amendment, we are not pressing the Minister to accept a numerical formula or an equality in an exact sense, but we hope that he can assure us, even if he wishes to use terms such as "substantial" or "significant", that he is not proposing, as is possible given the drafting of the provision, to meet the requirement that there should be independent representatives by putting the odd person on the board. We must have an indication that the Minister intends to take this seriously.<br><br>
Perhaps the Secretary of State's hands are securely tied by the governor of the Bank of England in such matters, although I hope that that is not the case. Surely the Secretary of State and the Minister must be able to give us some comfort not in a numerical formula but perhaps with a statement such as, "Of course we envisage roughly half the composition of the members of the board would be those falling within paragraph 1(3) (a)—those with experience of investment business—but roughly half would be users and the other half would be entirely independent."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ashdown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or a substantial proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a substantial proportion. Can the Minister say something along those lines? He has not moved at all: the only people identified in the provision are those with experience and those who are users. They are specified and singled out. That is the reason for the anxiety of his hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash). In neither case has any attempt been made to tell us that those interests will be represented substantially. It is entirely up to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), but I suspect that we may have to vote on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course we expect a significant proportion of the members of the board of the agency to be independent people, but I am not prepared to go to the extent of laying down a numerical formula.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>:<i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put, <i>but</i> The Chairman <i>withheld his assent, and declined then to put that Question.</i></span></p>
